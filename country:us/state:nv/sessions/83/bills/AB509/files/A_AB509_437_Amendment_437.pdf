AN ACT relating to utilities; requiring [the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada
to annually review whether certain persons that hold a certificate of
public convenience and necessity continue to operate as a public
utility; exempting certain persons that provide telecommunication
service from regulation by the Commission; authorizing] broadband
providers to enter into agreements with local governments to [grant
franchises and impose certain fees for the use and occupation of]
access the public right-of-way [or highway by broadband service
providers and broadband infrastructure providers;] managed by the
local government; requiring such agreements to be performed in a
nondiscriminatory matter; establishing certain compensation
requirements under agreements between broadband providers and
local governments; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to regulate public
2 utilities that provide telecommunication service to the public. (Chapter 704 of NRS) Existing
3 law requires any person who owns, controls, operates, maintains or has any contemplation of
4 owning, controlling or operating a public utility to obtain a certificate of public convenience
5 and necessity from the Commission before beginning operation or construction of any line,
6 plant or system or any extension thereof. (NRS 704.330) Section 2 of this bill provides that a
7 person is not a public utility that is required to be regulated by the Commission if the person:
8 (1) is engaged in the business of furnishing a telecommunication service for compensation; (2)
9 serves 25 persons or less; and (3) earned $50,000 or less from the gross sales of intrastate
10 telecommunications services during the immediately preceding 12 months. Sections 6 and 19
11 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the renumbering of certain subsections by
12 section 2.
13 Section 1 of this bill requires the Commission to annually review each person who holds
14 a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide telecommunication service to
15 determine whether the person continues to operate as a public utility in this State. Section 1

Assembly Amendment No. 437 to Assembly Bill No. 509 Page 4
16 requires the Commission to revoke a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted
17 to such a person if, after a reasonable investigation and hearing, the Commission determines
18 that the person: (1) no longer owns, controls, maintains or operates as a public utility; (2) the
19 person does not plan to start, continue or resume operating as a public utility in this State by a
20 definite date; and (3) the person has no definite plan to own, control or operate a public utility
21 that is otherwise required to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Sections
22 4 and 5 of this bill require the Commission to conduct hearings and issue orders under section
23 1 in the same manner as the Commission conducts hearings and issues orders for other matters
24 relating to certificates of public convenience and necessity.]
25 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant certain public utilities
26 the franchise, right and privilege to construct, install, operate and maintain lines, mains and
27 other utility equipment in any unincorporated town in the county and along the public roads
28 and highways of the county. (NRS 709.050) Existing law also authorizes a local government
29 to: (1) manage the use of any public right-of-way or highway by video service providers; and
30 (2) require a video service provider to pay a franchise fee for the privilege of providing video
31 service through a network that occupies or uses any public right-of-way or highway within the
32 jurisdiction of the local government. (NRS 711.640, 711.670) Section [14] 17.5 of this bill
33 [authorizes a local government to adopt an ordinance to grant a broadband service provider or
34 broadband infrastructure provider the franchise, right and privilege to construct, install,
35 operate and maintain broadband equipment and broadband service lines in the public right-of-
36 way and along the highways in the jurisdiction of the local government. Section 14 requires a
37 broadband service provider or broadband infrastructure provider to obtain a franchise from a
38 local government that has adopted such an ordinance before constructing or installing any
39 broadband equipment or broadband service lines within the jurisdiction of the local
40 government. If a local government has not adopted an ordinance, section 14 requires a
41 broadband service provider or broadband infrastructure provider to enter into an agreement
42 with the local government concerning the use and occupation of the public right-of-way or
43 highway. Section 15 of this bill: (1) prescribes the requirements of such an ordinance,
44 agreement or franchise; and (2) authorizes a local government to impose a fee against a
45 broadband service provider or broadband infrastructure provider for the privilege of using and
46 occupying the public right-of-way or highway of the local government. Section 16 of this bill
47 requires that such a fee: (1) be assessed equally and uniformly; and (2) reflect a reasonable
48 charge for the use and occupation of the public right-of-way or highway, which may not
49 exceed 5 percent of the gross revenue of the broadband service provider or broadband
50 infrastructure provider earned by providing services within the jurisdiction of the local
51 government. Section 17 of this bill authorizes a local government to take certain regulatory
52 actions with respect to its management of the use and occupation of its public right-of-way or
53 highway by broadband service providers and broadband infrastructure providers. Section 18
54 of this bill excludes a fee imposed by a local government pursuant to section 16 from certain
55 prohibitions on the ability of a local government to adopt or increase certain other fees for
56 business licenses.
57 Sections 10 and 12 of this bill exclude persons who are regulated by the Commission as
58 public utilities and persons who are authorized to construct and operate a video service
59 network from the definition of broadband infrastructure provider and broadband service
60 provider, respectively. Sections 9, 11 and 13 of this bill define certain other terms, and section
61 8 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions to the provisions of sections 8-
62 17. Section 3 of this bill establishes the applicability of the existing definition of “electric
63 utility” for purposes of section 1.] provides that a broadband provider may not access the
64 public right-of-way of a local government responsible for the management of the public
65 right-of-way on or after July 1, 2026, unless the broadband provider has entered into an
66 agreement with the local government with respect to access to the right-of-way. Section
67 17.5 requires a local government to execute and perform agreements with broadband
68 providers in a nondiscriminatory manner. Section 17.5 requires an agreement between a
69 broadband provider and local government to provide for compensation to be paid to the
70 local government, which must not exceed 2 percent of the annual gross revenue derived
71 by the broadband provider from providing broadband service, broadband
72 infrastructure access or both broadband service and broadband infrastructure access
73 within the jurisdiction of the local government that manages the right-of-way. Section
74 19.5 of this bill prohibits a local government from suspending or revoking a broadband

Assembly Amendment No. 437 to Assembly Bill No. 509 Page 5
75 provider’s access to the public right-of-way managed by the local government on the
76 basis that the broadband provider has not entered into an agreement with the local
77 government pursuant to section 17.5, unless such suspension or revocation occurs after
78 July 1, 2026.
79 Section 17.5 excludes from the definition of “broadband provider” certain persons
80 who are: (1) authorized to act as a video service provider or to construct and operate a
81 video service network; (2) providers of basic network service; and (3) providers of
82 commercial mobile radio service. Section 18 of this bill excludes any fee imposed by a
83 local government pursuant to an agreement with a broadband provider in accordance
84 with section 17.5 from certain prohibitions on the ability of the local government to
85 adopt or increase certain other fees for business licenses.

38 charged by a local government pursuant to this subsection may not exceed the
39 actual costs incurred by the local government in administering the process of
40 issuing such permits or licenses and performing such inspections.
41 4. If there is a situation necessitating emergency response work or repair in,
42 on, under or over any public right-of-way or highway, a broadband service
43 provider or broadband infrastructure provider may begin such work or repair
44 without prior approval from a local government if the applicable provider notifies
45 the local government as promptly as reasonably possible after learning of the
46 need for that work or repair.] (Deleted by amendment.)
47 Sec. 17.5. Chapter 709 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a
48 new section to read as follows:
49 1. A broadband provider engaged in the business of providing, for
50 compensation, broadband service or broadband infrastructure access may not

52 broadband provider has entered into an agreement with the local government
53 responsible for managing the right-of-way pursuant to this section.

Assembly Amendment No. 437 to Assembly Bill No. 509 Page 11
1 2. A local government shall execute and perform agreements with
2 broadband providers pursuant to subsection 1 in a nondiscriminatory manner.
3 3. An agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 1 must provide for
4 compensation to be paid by the broadband provider to the local government that
5 manages the public right-of-way to which the broadband provider is seeking
6 access. Such compensation:
7 (a) Must not exceed 2 percent of the annual gross revenue derived from
8 providing broadband service, broadband infrastructure access or both broadband
9 service and broadband infrastructure access within the jurisdiction of the local
10 government that manages the right-of-way; and
11 (b) May take the form of a franchise fee, license fee or such other
12 compensation as the local government may require.
13 4. The requirements of subsection 1 apply to any broadband provider
14 attempting to access the public right-of-way maintained by a local government,
15 regardless of whether the broadband provider has been issued a certificate of
16 public convenience and necessity by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada
17 pursuant to chapter 704 of NRS.
18 5. The provisions of this section shall not be construed as prohibiting any
19 person or entity from providing an interstate or intrastate telecommunications
20 service for the purposes of 47 U.S.C. § 253.
21 6. As used in this section:
22 (a) “Broadband infrastructure access” means the provision of open access
23 network or other wholesale signal transmission service for the provision of
24 broadband service.
25 (b) “Broadband provider” means any person that:
26 (1) Provides or offers to provide broadband service, broadband
27 infrastructure access or both broadband service and broadband infrastructure
28 access;
29 (2) Does not hold a certificate of authority to act as a video service
30 provider or to construct or operate a video service network pursuant to chapter
31 711 of NRS;
32 (3) Is not a provider of basic network service, as that term is defined in
33 NRS 704.006; and
34 (4) Is not licensed by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada as a
35 provider of commercial mobile radio service pursuant to NRS 704.033.
36 (c) “Broadband service” means a service that, by wire, radio or any other
37 technology, provides a person with the capability to transmit data to and receive
38 data from all or substantially all Internet endpoints at a rate that is generally not
39 less than 20 megabits per second in at least one direction.
40 (d) “Local government” means any city or county and includes, without
41 limitation:
42 (1) Any entity or agency that is directly or indirectly controlled by any
43 city or county; and
44 (2) Any entity or agency that is created by joint action or any interlocal
45 or cooperative agreement of two or more cities or counties, or any combination
46 thereof.
47 Sec. 18. NRS 354.5989 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 354.5989 1. A local government shall not increase any fee for a business
49 license or adopt a fee for a business license issued for revenue or regulation, or
50 both, except as permitted by this section. This prohibition does not apply to fees:
51 (a) Imposed by hospitals, county airports, airport authorities, convention
52 authorities, the Las Vegas Valley Water District or the Clark County Sanitation
53 District;

Assembly Amendment No. 437 to Assembly Bill No. 509 Page 12
1 (b) Imposed on public utilities for the privilege of doing business pursuant to a
2 franchise;
3 (c) Imposed on broadband [service] providers [and broadband infrastructure
4 providers] in accordance with an agreement entered into pursuant to section [16]
5 17.5 of this act;
6 (d) Imposed in compliance with the provisions of NRS 711.670 on video
7 service providers for the privilege of doing business pursuant to chapter 711 of
8 NRS;
9 [(d)] (e) For business licenses which are calculated as a fraction or percentage
10 of the gross revenue of the business;
11 [(e)] (f) Imposed pursuant to NRS 244.348, 268.0973, 268.821 or 269.182; or
12 [(f)] (g) Regulated pursuant to NRS 354.59881 to 354.59889, inclusive.
13 2. The amount of revenue the local government derives or is allowed to
14 derive, whichever is greater, from all fees for business licenses except:
15 (a) The fees excluded by subsection 1, for the fiscal year ended on June 30,
16 1991; and
17 (b) The fees collected for a particular type of business during the immediately
18 preceding fiscal year ending on June 30 that a local government will not collect in
19 the next subsequent fiscal year,
20  is the base from which the maximum allowable revenue from such fees must be
21 calculated for the next subsequent fiscal year. To the base must be added the sum of
22 the amounts respectively equal to the product of the base multiplied by the
23 percentage increase in the population of the local government added to the
24 percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the year ending on December
25 31 next preceding the year for which the limit is being calculated. The amount so
26 determined becomes the base for computing the allowed increase for each
27 subsequent year.
28 3. A local government may not increase any fee for a business license which
29 is calculated as a fraction or percentage of the gross revenue of the business if its
30 total revenues from such fees have increased during the preceding fiscal year by
31 more than the increase in the Consumer Price Index during that preceding calendar
32 year. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a fee:
33 (a) Imposed in compliance with the provisions of NRS 711.670 on video
34 service providers for the privilege of doing business pursuant to chapter 711 of
35 NRS;
36 (b) Imposed pursuant to NRS 244.348, 268.0973, 268.821 or 269.182; or
37 (c) Regulated pursuant to NRS 354.59881 to 354.59889, inclusive.
38 4. A local government may submit an application to increase its revenue from
39 fees for business licenses beyond the amount allowable pursuant to this section to
40 the Nevada Tax Commission, which may grant the application only if it finds that
41 the rate of a business license of the local government is substantially below that of
42 other local governments in the State.
43 5. The provisions of this section apply to a business license regardless of the
44 fund to which the revenue from it is assigned. An ordinance or resolution enacted
45 by a local government in violation of the provisions of this section is void.
46 6. As used in this section, “fee for a business license” does not include a tax
47 imposed on the revenues from the rental of transient lodging.
48 Sec. 19. [NRS 459A.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
49 459A.010 As used in this chapter, “public utility” means any person who
50 furnishes electricity to other persons. The term includes municipal utilities but does
51 not include persons who furnish electricity only in emergencies or persons
52 described in subsection [4] 5 of NRS 704.021.] (Deleted by amendment.)
