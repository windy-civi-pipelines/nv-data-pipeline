Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Virtual Early Childhood Family Engagement Pilot
2 Program within the Department of Health and Human Services and requires the
3 Department to select a nonprofit organization that is recognized as exempt from

6 renames the Program the “Virtual Early Childhood Family Engagement Program.”
