EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
services which a school district is required to provide to a
child with a disability who transfers from a different
school district; requiring a collective bargaining
agreement entered into by a large school district to
contain certain provisions concerning compensation;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires each state
2 educational agency, other state agency or local educational agency to conduct an
3 initial evaluation of a child before determining whether the child requires special
4 education services. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)) The Act additionally requires each state
5 educational agency, other state agency or local educational agency to, at the
6 beginning of each school year, have an individualized education program in effect
7 for each child with a disability. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A)) Furthermore, the Act
8 provides that, if a child with a disability who has an individualized education
9 program transfers to a new school district during the academic year, the local
10 educational agency to which he or she transfers is required to provide services
11 comparable to those in the individualized education program from the previous
12 school district, in consultation with the parent or legal guardian of the child, until:
13 (1) if the new school district is in the same state, the local educational agency
14 adopts the individualized education program from the previous school district or
15 develops, adopts and implements a new individualized education program; or (2) if
16 the new school district is in a different state, the local educational agency conducts
17 an evaluation of the pupil, if determined to be necessary, and develops a new
18 individualized education program, if appropriate. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(C)(i))

19 Existing law in this State requires an examination of a child to be conducted
20 before any child is placed in a special program for pupils with disabilities, except
21 that a child who transfers schools due to the military transfer of a parent or legal
22 guardian must initially be provided the services the child received under the
23 individualized education program from the previous school. (NRS 388.433)
24 Section 1 of this bill adopts provisions similar to the provisions of the Act with
25 respect to the transfer of a child to a new school. If a child with a disability
26 transfers from a school inside or outside this State, section 1 requires the child to
27 initially be provided, in consultation with the child’s parent or guardian, services
28 that are comparable to the services the child received at his or her previous school
29 under his or her current individualized education program. If the child transferred
30 from a school inside this State, section 1 requires the child to receive these services
31 until the current individualized education program is adopted or another individual
32 education plan is developed, adopted and implemented. If the child transferred from
33 a school outside this State, section 1 requires the child to receive such services until
34 an examination is conducted, if determined to be necessary, and a new
35 individualized education program is developed, if appropriate.
36 Existing law provides that any school district in this State which has more than
37 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently only the Clark County
38 School District) is deemed to be a large school district. (NRS 388G.530) Under
39 existing law, the principal of a local school precinct within a large school district is
40 required to select staff in accordance with the applicable collective bargaining
41 agreements. (NRS 388G.610) Section 1.3 of this bill requires a collective
42 bargaining agreement entered into by a large school district with education support
43 staff to contain terms for compensation that are similar to those included in such an
44 agreement with teachers and administrators. Section 1.7 of this bill makes a
45 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 1.3 apply to large
46 school districts.
47 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
48 and requires the Commission to adopt regulations that: (1) with certain exceptions,
49 require teachers to obtain from the Department of Education an endorsement in a
50 field of specialization to be eligible to teach in that field; and (2) set forth the
51 educational requirements a teacher must satisfy to qualify for an endorsement in a
52 field of specialization. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Existing law authorizes a person
53 who holds a license to teach middle school, junior high school or secondary school
54 to teach only in his or her major or minor field of preparation, unless the
55 Commission provides an exception. (NRS 391.031) Existing law and regulations
56 provide that a person who is licensed to teach elementary school is authorized to
57 teach all subjects in elementary grades and, thus, existing law and regulations do
58 not specifically limit a person who is licensed to teach elementary school to teach
59 only in his or her major or minor field of preparation. (NRS 391.031;
60 NAC 391.090)
61 Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing
62 the requirements for a teacher, administrator or other educational personnel to
63 obtain an endorsement to teach music or art, which must include a requirement to
64 pass a competency test in the subject matter of music or art, as applicable. Section
65 2 also requires the Commission to adopt regulations that require a teacher to obtain
66 an endorsement from the Department of Education to teach music or art to be
67 eligible to teach music or art, as applicable, at an elementary school, middle school,
68 junior high school or secondary school, except for a teacher at an elementary school
69 in which fewer than 500 pupils are enrolled. This requirement is subject to the
70 existing, generally applicable exemption from the requirement for a teacher to hold
71 an endorsement in a field of specialization to teach in that subject area if a shortage
72 of teachers exists in that subject area and the board of trustees of a school district
