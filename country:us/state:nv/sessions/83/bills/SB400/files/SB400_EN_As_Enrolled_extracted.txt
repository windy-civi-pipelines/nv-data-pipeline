CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
services which a school district is required to provide to a
child with a disability who transfers from a different school
district; revising provisions governing the qualifications of
music teachers and art teachers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires each state
educational agency, other state agency or local educational agency to conduct an
initial evaluation of a child before determining whether the child requires special
education services. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)) The Act additionally requires each state
educational agency, other state agency or local educational agency to, at the
beginning of each school year, have an individualized education program in effect
for each child with a disability. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A)) Furthermore, the Act
provides that, if a child with a disability who has an individualized education
program transfers to a new school district during the academic year, the local
educational agency to which he or she transfers is required to provide services
comparable to those in the individualized education program from the previous
school district, in consultation with the parent or legal guardian of the child, until:
(1) if the new school district is in the same state, the local educational agency
adopts the individualized education program from the previous school district or
develops, adopts and implements a new individualized education program; or (2) if
the new school district is in a different state, the local educational agency conducts
an evaluation of the pupil, if determined to be necessary, and develops a new
individualized education program, if appropriate. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(C)(i))
Existing law in this State requires an examination of a child to be conducted
before any child is placed in a special program for pupils with disabilities, except
that a child who transfers schools due to the military transfer of a parent or legal
guardian must initially be provided the services the child received under the
individualized education program from the previous school. (NRS 388.433)

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill adopts provisions similar to the provisions of the Act with
respect to the transfer of a child to a new school. If a child with a disability
transfers from a school inside or outside this State, section 1 requires the child to
initially be provided, in consultation with the child’s parent or guardian, services
that are comparable to the services the child received at his or her previous school
under his or her current individualized education program. If the child transferred
from a school inside this State, section 1 requires the child to receive these services
until the current individualized education program is adopted or another individual
education plan is developed, adopted and implemented. If the child transferred from
a school outside this State, section 1 requires the child to receive such services until
an examination is conducted, if determined to be necessary, and a new
individualized education program is developed, if appropriate.
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to adopt regulations that: (1) with certain exceptions,
require teachers to obtain from the Department of Education an endorsement in a
field of specialization to be eligible to teach in that field; and (2) set forth the
educational requirements a teacher must satisfy to qualify for an endorsement in a
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
field of specialization. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Existing law authorizes a person
who holds a license to teach middle school, junior high school or secondary school
to teach only in his or her major or minor field of preparation, unless the
Commission provides an exception. (NRS 391.031) Existing law and regulations
provide that a person who is licensed to teach elementary school is authorized to
teach all subjects in elementary grades and, thus, existing law and regulations do
not specifically limit a person who is licensed to teach elementary school to teach
only in his or her major or minor field of preparation. (NRS 391.031;
NAC 391.090)

Section 3:
Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing
the requirements for a teacher, administrator or other educational personnel to
obtain an endorsement to teach music or art, which must include a requirement to
pass a competency test in the subject matter of music or art, as applicable. Section
2 also requires the Commission to adopt regulations that require a teacher to obtain
an endorsement from the Department of Education to teach music or art to be
eligible to teach music or art, as applicable, at an elementary school, middle school,
junior high school or secondary school, except for a teacher at an elementary
school: (1) located in a school district in which fewer than 200,000 pupils are
enrolled (currently all school districts other than the Clark County School District);
or (2) in which fewer than 500 pupils are enrolled. This requirement is subject to
the existing, generally applicable exemption from the requirement for a teacher to
hold an endorsement in a field of specialization to teach in that subject area if a
shortage of teachers exists in that subject area and the board of trustees of a school
district obtains authorization from the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
temporarily employ licensed teachers who do not hold such an endorsement.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 400–Senators Dondero Loop;
Doñate, Ohrenschall, Pazina and Taylor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
services which a school district is required to provide to a
child with a disability who transfers from a different school
district; revising provisions governing the qualifications of
music teachers and art teachers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requires each state
educational agency, other state agency or local educational agency to conduct an
initial evaluation of a child before determining whether the child requires special
education services. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)) The Act additionally requires each state
educational agency, other state agency or local educational agency to, at the
beginning of each school year, have an individualized education program in effect
for each child with a disability. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(A)) Furthermore, the Act
provides that, if a child with a disability who has an individualized education
program transfers to a new school district during the academic year, the local
educational agency to which he or she transfers is required to provide services
comparable to those in the individualized education program from the previous
school district, in consultation with the parent or legal guardian of the child, until:
(1) if the new school district is in the same state, the local educational agency
adopts the individualized education program from the previous school district or
develops, adopts and implements a new individualized education program; or (2) if
the new school district is in a different state, the local educational agency conducts
an evaluation of the pupil, if determined to be necessary, and develops a new
individualized education program, if appropriate. (20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2)(C)(i))
Existing law in this State requires an examination of a child to be conducted
before any child is placed in a special program for pupils with disabilities, except
that a child who transfers schools due to the military transfer of a parent or legal
guardian must initially be provided the services the child received under the
individualized education program from the previous school. (NRS 388.433)
Section 1 of this bill adopts provisions similar to the provisions of the Act with
respect to the transfer of a child to a new school. If a child with a disability
transfers from a school inside or outside this State, section 1 requires the child to
initially be provided, in consultation with the child’s parent or guardian, services
that are comparable to the services the child received at his or her previous school
under his or her current individualized education program. If the child transferred
from a school inside this State, section 1 requires the child to receive these services
until the current individualized education program is adopted or another individual
education plan is developed, adopted and implemented. If the child transferred from
a school outside this State, section 1 requires the child to receive such services until
an examination is conducted, if determined to be necessary, and a new
individualized education program is developed, if appropriate.
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to adopt regulations that: (1) with certain exceptions,
require teachers to obtain from the Department of Education an endorsement in a
field of specialization to be eligible to teach in that field; and (2) set forth the
educational requirements a teacher must satisfy to qualify for an endorsement in a
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
field of specialization. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Existing law authorizes a person
who holds a license to teach middle school, junior high school or secondary school
to teach only in his or her major or minor field of preparation, unless the
Commission provides an exception. (NRS 391.031) Existing law and regulations
provide that a person who is licensed to teach elementary school is authorized to
teach all subjects in elementary grades and, thus, existing law and regulations do
not specifically limit a person who is licensed to teach elementary school to teach
only in his or her major or minor field of preparation. (NRS 391.031;
NAC 391.090)
Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing
the requirements for a teacher, administrator or other educational personnel to
obtain an endorsement to teach music or art, which must include a requirement to
pass a competency test in the subject matter of music or art, as applicable. Section
2 also requires the Commission to adopt regulations that require a teacher to obtain
an endorsement from the Department of Education to teach music or art to be
eligible to teach music or art, as applicable, at an elementary school, middle school,
junior high school or secondary school, except for a teacher at an elementary
school: (1) located in a school district in which fewer than 200,000 pupils are
enrolled (currently all school districts other than the Clark County School District);
or (2) in which fewer than 500 pupils are enrolled. This requirement is subject to
the existing, generally applicable exemption from the requirement for a teacher to
hold an endorsement in a field of specialization to teach in that subject area if a
shortage of teachers exists in that subject area and the board of trustees of a school
district obtains authorization from the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
temporarily employ licensed teachers who do not hold such an endorsement.
