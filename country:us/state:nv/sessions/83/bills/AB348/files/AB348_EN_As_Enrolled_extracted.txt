general election the membership of any member of the Committee who does not
become a candidate for reelection or who is defeated for reelection.
Existing law establishes the Legislators’ Retirement System to provide benefits

the estimated future revenue to, and the estimated future expenditure from, the
major funds in the State Treasury under various potential economic conditions; and

and the Legislature and cause the posting of the report on the Internet website of the
Legislature. (NRS 218F.600)

Bureau is required to: (1) collect and analyze data and issue reports concerning
certain provisions and programs relating to education; (2) conduct studies and
analyses to evaluate the performance and progress of the system of public
education within this State; and (3) submit biennial reports of its findings. (NRS

Assembly Bill No. 348–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the Legislature; revising provisions relating to
the Interim Retirement and Benefits Committee of the
Legislature; eliminating the duty of the Fiscal Analysis
Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau to perform
certain budget stress testing; abolishing the Legislative
Bureau of Educational Accountability and Program
Evaluation within the Fiscal Analysis Division; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Interim Retirement and Benefits Committee of the
Legislature to review the operation of and make recommendations regarding the
Public Employees’ Retirement System, Judicial Retirement System and Public
Employees’ Benefits Program. The Committee consists of three members of the
Senate and three members of the Assembly. (NRS 218E.420) Section 1 of this bill:
(1) provides for the terms of the members of the Committee, appointment of
alternates and the filling of vacancies; and (2) terminates on the day next after the
general election the membership of any member of the Committee who does not
become a candidate for reelection or who is defeated for reelection.
Existing law establishes the Legislators’ Retirement System to provide benefits
at retirement or death for Legislators who are members. (NRS 218C.100) The
Public Employees’ Retirement Board administers the Legislators’ Retirement
System. (NRS 218C.150) Section 1 requires the Interim Retirement and Benefits
Committee to also review the operation of and make recommendations regarding
the Legislators’ Retirement System.
Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirements in existing law for the Fiscal
Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau to: (1) perform, to the extent
of available resources, a budget stress test in each even-numbered year comparing
the estimated future revenue to, and the estimated future expenditure from, the
major funds in the State Treasury under various potential economic conditions; and
(2) submit a report regarding the results of the budget stress test to the Governor
and the Legislature and cause the posting of the report on the Internet website of the
Legislature. (NRS 218F.600)
Existing law creates the Legislative Bureau of Educational Accountability and
Program Evaluation within the Fiscal Analysis Division. Under existing law, the
