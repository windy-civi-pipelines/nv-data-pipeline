7 alternates and the filling of vacancies; and (2) terminates on the day next after the
8 general election the membership of any member of the Committee who does not

13 System. (NRS 218C.150) Section 1 requires the Interim Retirement and Benefits
14 Committee to also review the operation of and make recommendations regarding
15 the Legislators’ Retirement System.

7 alternates and the filling of vacancies; and (2) terminates on the day next after the
8 general election the membership of any member of the Committee who does not
9 become a candidate for reelection or who is defeated for reelection.

12 Public Employees’ Retirement Board administers the Legislators’ Retirement
13 System. (NRS 218C.150) Section 1 requires the Interim Retirement and Benefits
14 Committee to also review the operation of and make recommendations regarding
