EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission to live
entertainment events through certain resales; requiring certain persons
who facilitate resales of admission to live entertainment events to
collect the excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain circumstances;
[repealing the exemption for certain athletic events involving a
professional team based in this State from the excise tax on live
entertainment;] authorizing the Department of Taxation to adopt
regulations to require certain persons who list or advertise resales of
admissions to live entertainment events to collect and remit the tax
under certain circumstances; revising the distribution of the
proceeds of the tax; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent of the
2 admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided.
3 Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected from the purchaser at the
4 time of purchase, whether or not the admission is purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200)
5 Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
6 events to also be imposed on each resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional
7 sale. Section 13 requires a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a
8 purchaser on the amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax
9 paid by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.
10 [Existing law exempts from the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
11 events, an athletic contest, event or exhibition conducted by a professional team based in this
12 State if the professional team based in this State is a participant in the contest, event or
13 exhibition. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13 eliminates this exemption.]
14 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates resales of
15 admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to collect and remit the tax
16 if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had

Senate Amendment No. 366 to Senate Bill No. 431 Page 4
17 more than $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or
18 more sales transactions, on the facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the
19 facilitator enters into an agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume
20 responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that
21 such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
22 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations requiring
23 certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or advertising resales for a reseller of
24 admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided but who do not collect
25 money or other consideration from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or
26 more sales transactions result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross
27 receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
28 Existing law requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
29 events to be collected by the Nevada Gaming Control Board or the Department,
30 depending on whether the live entertainment was provided at a licensed gaming
31 establishment. (NRS 368A.110, 368A.140) Existing law requires the Board and the
32 Department to deposit all taxes, interest and penalties received from the tax in the State
33 Treasury for credit to the State General Fund, except that, on or before October 1 of
34 each year, the Department is required to deposit $150,000 from the taxes, interest and
35 penalties it receives in the State Treasury for credit to the Nevada Arts Council as a
36 continuing appropriation. (NRS 368A.220) Section 13.5 of this bill requires one-ninth of
37 all taxes, interest and penalties received from the tax after the distribution to the Nevada
38 Arts Council, to be distributed to the regional transportation commission in a county
39 whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) for use for the
40 operation and maintenance of a public transit system.
41 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on admission to
42 live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to make these
43 definitions applicable to this tax.
