EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission
to live entertainment events through certain resales;
requiring certain persons who facilitate resales of
admission to live entertainment events to collect the
excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain
circumstances; authorizing the Department of Taxation to
adopt regulations to require certain persons who list or
advertise resales of admissions to live entertainment
events to collect and remit the tax under certain
circumstances; revising the distribution of the proceeds of
the tax; making an appropriation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent
2 of the admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment
3 is provided. Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected
4 from the purchaser at the time of purchase, whether or not the admission is
5 purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax
6 imposed on admission to live entertainment events to also be imposed on each
7 resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional sale. Section 13 requires
8 a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a purchaser on the
9 amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax paid
10 by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.
11 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates
12 resales of admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to
-
*SB431_R2*
– 2 –
13 collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the
14 current calendar year, the facilitator had more than $100,000 of gross receipts from
15 certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or more sales transactions, on the
16 facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the facilitator enters into an
17 agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume responsibility for
18 the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that such a
19 facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
20 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt
21 regulations requiring certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
22 advertising resales for a reseller of admission to certain facilities where live
23 entertainment is provided but who do not collect money or other consideration from
24 a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more sales transactions
25 result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross receipts of sales
26 resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
27 Existing law requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
28 events, commonly referred to as the live entertainment tax, to be collected by the
29 Nevada Gaming Control Board or the Department, depending on whether the live
30 entertainment was provided at a licensed gaming establishment. (NRS 368A.110,
31 368A.140) Existing law requires the Board and the Department to deposit all taxes,
32 interest and penalties received from the live entertainment tax in the State Treasury
33 for credit to the State General Fund, except that, on or before October 1 of each
34 year, the Department is required to deposit $150,000 from the taxes, interest and
35 penalties it receives in the State Treasury for credit to the Nevada Arts Council as a
36 continuing appropriation. (NRS 368A.220) Sections 13.5 and 13.9 of this bill
37 require that 1/36 of all taxes, interest and penalties received from the live
38 entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or after January 1, 2026, after
39 subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts Council, must be
40 distributed to the regional transportation commission in a county whose population
41 is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) for use for the operation and
42 maintenance of a public transit system. Sections 13.6, 13.9 and 14 of this bill
43 provide that if a certain ballot question for the imposition of a sales and use tax to
44 provide certain funding for that regional transportation commission is not submitted
45 or approved by the voters of such a county before January 1, 2029, the distribution
46 of the live entertainment tax to the regional transportation commission must
47 increase to one-ninth of all taxes, interest and penalties received from the live
48 entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or after July 1, 2029, after
49 subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts Council.
50 Section 13.8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Taxation
51 for certain expenses to implement the provisions of this bill.
52 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on
53 admission to live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming
54 change to make these definitions applicable to this tax.

REQUIRES TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE (§ 13) EXEMPT
(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 29, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT S.B. 431
SENATE BILL NO. 431–COMMITTEE ON
REVENUE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue and
Economic Development
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the excise tax on live
entertainment. (BDR 32-692)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission
to live entertainment events through certain resales;
requiring certain persons who facilitate resales of
admission to live entertainment events to collect the
excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain
circumstances; authorizing the Department of Taxation to
adopt regulations to require certain persons who list or
advertise resales of admissions to live entertainment
events to collect and remit the tax under certain
circumstances; revising the distribution of the proceeds of
the tax; making an appropriation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent
2 of the admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment
3 is provided. Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected
4 from the purchaser at the time of purchase, whether or not the admission is
5 purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax
6 imposed on admission to live entertainment events to also be imposed on each
7 resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional sale. Section 13 requires
8 a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a purchaser on the
9 amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax paid
10 by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.
11 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates
12 resales of admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to
-
*SB431_R2*

– 2 –
13 collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the
14 current calendar year, the facilitator had more than $100,000 of gross receipts from
15 certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or more sales transactions, on the
16 facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the facilitator enters into an
17 agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume responsibility for
18 the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that such a
19 facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
20 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt
21 regulations requiring certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
22 advertising resales for a reseller of admission to certain facilities where live
23 entertainment is provided but who do not collect money or other consideration from
24 a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more sales transactions
25 result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross receipts of sales
26 resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
27 Existing law requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
28 events, commonly referred to as the live entertainment tax, to be collected by the
29 Nevada Gaming Control Board or the Department, depending on whether the live
30 entertainment was provided at a licensed gaming establishment. (NRS 368A.110,
31 368A.140) Existing law requires the Board and the Department to deposit all taxes,
32 interest and penalties received from the live entertainment tax in the State Treasury
33 for credit to the State General Fund, except that, on or before October 1 of each
34 year, the Department is required to deposit $150,000 from the taxes, interest and
35 penalties it receives in the State Treasury for credit to the Nevada Arts Council as a
36 continuing appropriation. (NRS 368A.220) Sections 13.5 and 13.9 of this bill
37 require that 1/36 of all taxes, interest and penalties received from the live
38 entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or after January 1, 2026, after
39 subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts Council, must be
40 distributed to the regional transportation commission in a county whose population
41 is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) for use for the operation and
42 maintenance of a public transit system. Sections 13.6, 13.9 and 14 of this bill
43 provide that if a certain ballot question for the imposition of a sales and use tax to
44 provide certain funding for that regional transportation commission is not submitted
45 or approved by the voters of such a county before January 1, 2029, the distribution
46 of the live entertainment tax to the regional transportation commission must
47 increase to one-ninth of all taxes, interest and penalties received from the live
48 entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or after July 1, 2029, after
49 subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts Council.
50 Section 13.8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Taxation
51 for certain expenses to implement the provisions of this bill.
52 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on
53 admission to live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming
54 change to make these definitions applicable to this tax.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 368A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 to 10, inclusive,
3 of this act.

5 owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or is under common
