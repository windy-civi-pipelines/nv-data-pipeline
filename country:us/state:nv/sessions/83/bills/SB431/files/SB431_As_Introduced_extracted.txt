EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission
to live entertainment events through certain resales;
requiring certain persons who facilitate resales of
admission to live entertainment events to collect the
excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain
circumstances; repealing the exemption for certain
athletic events involving a professional team based in this
State from the excise tax on live entertainment;
authorizing the Department of Taxation to adopt
regulations to require certain persons who list or advertise
resales of admissions to live entertainment events to
collect and remit the tax under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent
2 of the admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment
3 is provided. Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected
4 from the purchaser at the time of purchase, whether or not the admission is
5 purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax
6 imposed on admission to live entertainment events to also be imposed on each
7 resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional sale. Section 13 requires
8 a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a purchaser on the
9 amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax paid
10 by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.

11 Existing law exempts from the excise tax imposed on admission to live
12 entertainment events, an athletic contest, event or exhibition conducted by a
13 professional team based in this State if the professional team based in this State is a
14 participant in the contest, event or exhibition. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13
15 eliminates this exemption.
16 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates
17 resales of admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to
18 collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the
19 current calendar year, the facilitator had more than $100,000 of gross receipts from
20 certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or more sales transactions, on the
21 facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the facilitator enters into an
22 agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume responsibility for
23 the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that such a
24 facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
25 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt
26 regulations requiring certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
27 advertising resales for a reseller of admission to certain facilities where live
28 entertainment is provided but who do not collect money or other consideration from
29 a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more sales transactions
30 result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross receipts of sales
31 resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
32 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on
33 admission to live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming
34 change to make these definitions applicable to this tax.

41 resales.
42 5. The tax imposed by subsection 1 does not apply to:

Raw Text:
REQUIRES TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE (§ 13)
S.B. 431
SENATE BILL NO. 431–COMMITTEE ON
REVENUE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue and
Economic Development
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the excise tax on live
entertainment. (BDR 32-692)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission
to live entertainment events through certain resales;
requiring certain persons who facilitate resales of
admission to live entertainment events to collect the
excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain
circumstances; repealing the exemption for certain
athletic events involving a professional team based in this
State from the excise tax on live entertainment;
authorizing the Department of Taxation to adopt
regulations to require certain persons who list or advertise
resales of admissions to live entertainment events to
collect and remit the tax under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent
2 of the admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment
3 is provided. Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected
4 from the purchaser at the time of purchase, whether or not the admission is
5 purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax
6 imposed on admission to live entertainment events to also be imposed on each
7 resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional sale. Section 13 requires
8 a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a purchaser on the
9 amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax paid
10 by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.

11 Existing law exempts from the excise tax imposed on admission to live
12 entertainment events, an athletic contest, event or exhibition conducted by a
13 professional team based in this State if the professional team based in this State is a
14 participant in the contest, event or exhibition. (NRS 368A.200) Section 13
15 eliminates this exemption.
16 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates
17 resales of admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to
18 collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the
19 current calendar year, the facilitator had more than $100,000 of gross receipts from
20 certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or more sales transactions, on the
21 facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the facilitator enters into an
22 agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume responsibility for
23 the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that such a
24 facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
25 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt
26 regulations requiring certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
27 advertising resales for a reseller of admission to certain facilities where live
28 entertainment is provided but who do not collect money or other consideration from
29 a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more sales transactions
30 result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross receipts of sales
31 resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
32 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on
33 admission to live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming
34 change to make these definitions applicable to this tax.

21 there is hereby imposed an excise tax on admission to any facility in
22 this State where live entertainment is provided and on the charge for

8 of any of those persons.
9 3. The tax imposed by this section must be added to and
10 collected from the purchaser at the time of purchase, whether or not
11 the admission for live entertainment is purchased for resale.
12 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, in addition

32 entertainment is provided is an occasional sale as defined in NRS
33 372.035, such a resale is exempt from the payment of any
34 additional amount of excise tax pursuant to this subsection. For
35 the purposes of this subsection, an “occasional sale” is a resale of

39 series of resales sufficient in number, scope and character to
40 constitute the activity of engaging in the business of making such
41 resales.
42 5. The tax imposed by subsection 1 does not apply to:
