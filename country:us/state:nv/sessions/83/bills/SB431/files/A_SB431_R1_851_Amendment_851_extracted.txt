EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission to live
entertainment events through certain resales; requiring certain persons
who facilitate resales of admission to live entertainment events to
collect the excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain circumstances;
authorizing the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations to require
certain persons who list or advertise resales of admissions to live
entertainment events to collect and remit the tax under certain
circumstances; revising the distribution of the proceeds of the tax;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent of the
2 admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided.
3 Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected from the purchaser at the
4 time of purchase, whether or not the admission is purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200)
5 Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
6 events to also be imposed on each resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional
7 sale. Section 13 requires a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a
8 purchaser on the amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax
9 paid by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.
10 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates resales of
11 admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to collect and remit the tax
12 if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had
13 more than $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or
14 more sales transactions, on the facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the
15 facilitator enters into an agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume
16 responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that
17 such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
18 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations requiring
19 certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or advertising resales for a reseller of
Senate Amendment No. 851 to Senate Bill No. 431 First Reprint Page 4
20 admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided but who do not collect
21 money or other consideration from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or
22 more sales transactions result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross
23 receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
24 Existing law requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment events ,
25 commonly referred to as the live entertainment tax, to be collected by the Nevada Gaming
26 Control Board or the Department, depending on whether the live entertainment was provided
27 at a licensed gaming establishment. (NRS 368A.110, 368A.140) Existing law requires the
28 Board and the Department to deposit all taxes, interest and penalties received from the live
29 entertainment tax in the State Treasury for credit to the State General Fund, except that, on
30 or before October 1 of each year, the Department is required to deposit $150,000 from the
31 taxes, interest and penalties it receives in the State Treasury for credit to the Nevada Arts
32 Council as a continuing appropriation. (NRS 368A.220) [Section] Sections 13.5 and 13.9 of
33 this bill [requires one-ninth] require that 1/36 of all taxes, interest and penalties received
34 from the live entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or after January 1,
35 2026, after subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts Council, [to] must
36 be distributed to the regional transportation commission in a county whose population is
37 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) for use for the operation and maintenance of a
38 public transit system. Sections 13.6, 13.9 and 14 of this bill provide that if a certain ballot
39 question for the imposition of a sales and use tax to provide certain funding for that
40 regional transportation commission is not submitted or approved by the voters of such a
41 county before January 1, 2029, the distribution of the live entertainment tax to the
42 regional transportation commission must increase to one-ninth of all taxes, interest and
43 penalties received from the live entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or
44 after July 1, 2029, after subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts
45 Council.
46 Section 13.8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Taxation for
47 certain expenses to implement the provisions of this bill.
48 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on admission to
49 live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to make these
50 definitions applicable to this tax.

49 by the reseller for the initial purchase of the admission and the admission charge
50 and tax collected when the reseller resells the admission. The reseller shall pass
51 through to the purchaser the amount of the tax imposed pursuant to this section
52 which was paid by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase by giving the
Senate Amendment No. 851 to Senate Bill No. 431 First Reprint Page 11
1 purchaser a credit on the amount of tax owed pursuant to this section on the

8 is provided is an occasional sale, such a resale is exempt from the payment of any
9 additional amount of excise tax pursuant to this subsection. For the purposes of
10 this subsection, an “occasional sale” is a resale of admission to a facility in this
11 State where live entertainment is provided by a person who is not engaged in the
12 business of reselling such admission, provided that such resale is not one of a
13 series of resales sufficient in number, scope and character to constitute the
14 activity of engaging in the business of making such resales.

17 Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States or the Nevada Constitution.

28 organized or existing under the provisions of chapter 82 of NRS, only if the number
29 of tickets to the live entertainment which are offered for sale or other distribution to
30 patrons, either directly or indirectly through a partner, subsidiary, client, affiliate or
31 other collaborator, is less than 7,500.
32 (e) Any boxing contest or exhibition governed by the provisions of chapter 467

42 (i) Music performed by musicians who move constantly through the audience

48 unless the entertainment is provided in a facility located within the mall.

Economic Development
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the excise tax on live entertainment.
(BDR 32-692)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; imposing the excise tax on admission to live
entertainment events through certain resales; requiring certain persons
who facilitate resales of admission to live entertainment events to
collect the excise tax on such resales; limiting the liability of such
persons for failure to collect the tax under certain circumstances;
authorizing the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations to require
certain persons who list or advertise resales of admissions to live
entertainment events to collect and remit the tax under certain
circumstances; revising the distribution of the proceeds of the tax;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax at a rate of 9 percent of the
2 admission charge on admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided.
3 Existing law additionally provides that such a tax must be collected from the purchaser at the
4 time of purchase, whether or not the admission is purchased for resale. (NRS 368A.200)
5 Section 13 of this bill requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment
6 events to also be imposed on each resale of admission by a reseller, other than an occasional
7 sale. Section 13 requires a reseller to retain certain records and to provide a credit to a
8 purchaser on the amount of tax owed on the resale of an admission based on the amount of tax
9 paid by the reseller at the time of the initial purchase of the admission.
10 Section 7 of this bill requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates resales of
11 admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided to collect and remit the tax
12 if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had
13 more than $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions or made or facilitated 200 or
14 more sales transactions, on the facilitator’s own behalf or on behalf of a reseller, unless the
15 facilitator enters into an agreement with a reseller whereby the reseller agrees to assume
16 responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section 8 of this bill provides that
17 such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under certain circumstances.
18 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations requiring
19 certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or advertising resales for a reseller of

Senate Amendment No. 851 to Senate Bill No. 431 First Reprint Page 4
20 admission to certain facilities where live entertainment is provided but who do not collect
21 money or other consideration from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or
22 more sales transactions result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross
23 receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000.
24 Existing law requires the excise tax imposed on admission to live entertainment events ,
25 commonly referred to as the live entertainment tax, to be collected by the Nevada Gaming
26 Control Board or the Department, depending on whether the live entertainment was provided
27 at a licensed gaming establishment. (NRS 368A.110, 368A.140) Existing law requires the
28 Board and the Department to deposit all taxes, interest and penalties received from the live
29 entertainment tax in the State Treasury for credit to the State General Fund, except that, on
30 or before October 1 of each year, the Department is required to deposit $150,000 from the
31 taxes, interest and penalties it receives in the State Treasury for credit to the Nevada Arts
32 Council as a continuing appropriation. (NRS 368A.220) [Section] Sections 13.5 and 13.9 of
33 this bill [requires one-ninth] require that 1/36 of all taxes, interest and penalties received
34 from the live entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or after January 1,
35 2026, after subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts Council, [to] must
36 be distributed to the regional transportation commission in a county whose population is
37 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) for use for the operation and maintenance of a
38 public transit system. Sections 13.6, 13.9 and 14 of this bill provide that if a certain ballot
39 question for the imposition of a sales and use tax to provide certain funding for that
40 regional transportation commission is not submitted or approved by the voters of such a
41 county before January 1, 2029, the distribution of the live entertainment tax to the
42 regional transportation commission must increase to one-ninth of all taxes, interest and
43 penalties received from the live entertainment tax for a taxable period beginning on or
44 after July 1, 2029, after subtracting the amount of the distribution to the Nevada Arts
45 Council.
46 Section 13.8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Taxation for
47 certain expenses to implement the provisions of this bill.
48 Sections 2-6 and 12 of this bill define certain terms relevant to the tax on admission to
49 live entertainment events. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to make these
50 definitions applicable to this tax.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
