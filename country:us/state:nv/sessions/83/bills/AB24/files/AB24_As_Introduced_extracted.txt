AN ACT relating to education; repealing the requirement for the
Department of Education to establish a pilot program to

a program of competency-based education; establishing
requirements for programs of competency-based

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Education to establish a pilot program
2 to provide competency-based education, which is a program of instruction by
3 which a pupil advances to a higher level of learning when the pupil demonstrates
4 mastery of a concept or skill, regardless of the time, place or pace at which the
5 pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200, 389.210) Under the pilot program: (1) the
6 Department is required to conduct a public awareness campaign regarding
7 competency-based education and is authorized to distribute competitive grants to
8 carry out the pilot program; (2) the board of trustees of a school district or the
9 governing body of a charter school is authorized to apply to the State Board of
10 Education for approval for a school to provide competency-based education; and
11 (3) a school selected to participate in the pilot program is required to satisfy certain
12 requirements to implement competency-based education in the school. (NRS
13 389.210) Section 9 of this bill repeals the pilot program, and sections 2-6 of this
14 bill establish a process by which the board of trustees of a school district, the
-

15 governing body of a charter school, a committee to form a charter school or a
16 charter management organization applying to form a charter school, or the
17 governing body of a university school for profoundly gifted pupils, may apply to
18 the Department for approval to provide a program of competency-based education.
19 Section 3 establishes requirements for: (1) the board of trustees of a school
20 district, the governing body of a charter school, a committee to form a charter
21 school or charter management organization applying to form a charter school, or
22 the governing body of a university school for profoundly gifted pupils to apply to
23 the Department for approval to provide a program of competency-based education;
24 (2) the approval or denial of such an application by the Department; and (3) the
25 development of a plan for conducting the program of competency-based education,
26 presenting the plan to the public and providing a copy of the plan to the school
27 community, parents and employees of the school district, charter school or
28 university school for profoundly gifted pupils. Section 4 requires the board of
29 trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school or university
30 school for profoundly gifted pupils, that provides a program of competency-based
31 education to ensure compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, rules and
32 policies, including, without limitation, requirements for graduation, the
33 accountability of public schools, the attendance and truancy of pupils, the discipline
34 of pupils and the administration of required examinations and assessments. Section
35 5 authorizes alternative scheduling for pupils participating in a program of
36 competency-based education. Section 2 establishes the methods by which a pupil
37 participating in a program of competency-based education may demonstrate
38 proficiency in a specific course of study, and section 7 of this bill makes a
39 conforming change to reflect the establishment of those methods in section 2.
40 Section 6 provides for the adoption of regulations by the State Board to carry out
41 programs of competency-based education. Section 8 of this bill makes a
42 conforming change to make the existing definition of “competency-based
43 education” apply to sections 2-6.
