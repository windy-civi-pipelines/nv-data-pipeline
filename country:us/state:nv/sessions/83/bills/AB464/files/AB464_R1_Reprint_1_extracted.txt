Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public
2 Schools to establish standards of content and performance for certain courses of
3 study, including: (1) English language arts; (2) science; (3) social studies, which
4 includes only the subjects of history, geography, economics, civics, financial
5 literacy and multicultural education; (4) the arts; and (5) health. Existing law
6 requires the Council to forward the standards of content and performance to the
7 State Board of Education for adoption by the State Board. (NRS 389.520) Existing
8 law requires the State Board to prescribe and cause to be enforced the courses of
9 study for all public schools in this State, which must comply with the standards
10 of content and performance established by the Council. (NRS 385.114) Section 1
11 of this bill prohibits the State Board from repealing, abrogating or refusing to
-
*AB464_R1*
– 2 –
12 enforce any course of study or any part of a course of study relating to certain
13 topics, such as genocides and other atrocities experienced by people from various
14 racial and ethnic backgrounds and the history of different ethnicities and cultures,
15 which were established by the State Board and in existence as of the effective date
16 of this bill. Similarly, section 1.7 of this bill prohibits the Council from repealing,
17 abrogating, reducing the priority assigned to or otherwise revising to substantially
18 weaken any standard of content and performance relating to certain topics which
19 were established by the Council, adopted by the State Board and in existence on the
20 effective date of this bill.
21 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts to enforce in
22 schools: (1) the standards of content and performance established by the Council;
23 and (2) the courses of study prescribed by the State Board. (NRS 389.003) Existing
24 law also requires each teacher in a public school to enforce the courses of study
25 prescribed by law. (NRS 391.260) Section 1.3 of this bill prohibits the board of
26 trustees of a school district, the governing body of a charter school or university for
27 profoundly gifted pupils, in certain circumstances, and a principal or administrator
28 of a public school from prohibiting the offering or teaching of or refusing to
29 enforce a course of study established by the State Board or standards of content and
30 performance established by the Council if that course or standard existed on the
31 effective date of this bill and relates to certain topics. Section 1.3 also prohibits a
32 teacher at a public school from refusing to teach or enforce a course of study or any
33 material that complies with a standard of content and performance if the teacher
34 would have been required to teach or enforce the course or standard as of the
35 effective date of this bill and the course or standard existed as of the effective date
36 of this bill and relates to certain topics.
37 Section 2 of this bill prohibits the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of
38 Higher Education, the governing body of a school district, county or city, a member
39 of such a governing body or a person with direct supervisory authority over an
40 administrator or teacher or certain other public employees from taking any adverse
41 employment action against an administrator, teacher or certain other public
42 employees based on certain characteristics or activities of the employee, including,
43 without limitation, his or her political, religious or social affiliation or independent
44 political, religious or social participation. Section 2 provides that a member of the
45 Board of Regents or governing body who takes such a prohibited adverse
46 employment action is guilty of a misdemeanor. Section 2 also requires the
47 governmental entity to terminate a direct supervisory employee who takes such a
48 prohibited adverse employment action in violation of section 2.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
requirements relating to the standards of content and
performance for certain courses; prohibiting the State
Board of Education from taking certain actions relating to
certain courses of study; prohibiting certain persons and
entities from refusing to enforce or taking certain other
actions with respect to certain courses of study and

public employees in direct supervisory roles from taking
adverse employment actions against certain employees
based on certain characteristics or activities; prohibiting
certain actions against such employees based on certain

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public
2 Schools to establish standards of content and performance for certain courses of
3 study, including: (1) English language arts; (2) science; (3) social studies, which
4 includes only the subjects of history, geography, economics, civics, financial
5 literacy and multicultural education; (4) the arts; and (5) health. Existing law
6 requires the Council to forward the standards of content and performance to the
7 State Board of Education for adoption by the State Board. (NRS 389.520) Existing
8 law requires the State Board to prescribe and cause to be enforced the courses of
9 study for all public schools in this State, which must comply with the standards
10 of content and performance established by the Council. (NRS 385.114) Section 1
11 of this bill prohibits the State Board from repealing, abrogating or refusing to
-
*AB464_R1*

– 2 –
12 enforce any course of study or any part of a course of study relating to certain
13 topics, such as genocides and other atrocities experienced by people from various
14 racial and ethnic backgrounds and the history of different ethnicities and cultures,
15 which were established by the State Board and in existence as of the effective date
16 of this bill. Similarly, section 1.7 of this bill prohibits the Council from repealing,
17 abrogating, reducing the priority assigned to or otherwise revising to substantially
18 weaken any standard of content and performance relating to certain topics which
19 were established by the Council, adopted by the State Board and in existence on the
20 effective date of this bill.
21 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts to enforce in
22 schools: (1) the standards of content and performance established by the Council;
23 and (2) the courses of study prescribed by the State Board. (NRS 389.003) Existing
24 law also requires each teacher in a public school to enforce the courses of study

26 trustees of a school district, the governing body of a charter school or university for
27 profoundly gifted pupils, in certain circumstances, and a principal or administrator
28 of a public school from prohibiting the offering or teaching of or refusing to
29 enforce a course of study established by the State Board or standards of content and
30 performance established by the Council if that course or standard existed on the
31 effective date of this bill and relates to certain topics. Section 1.3 also prohibits a
32 teacher at a public school from refusing to teach or enforce a course of study or any
33 material that complies with a standard of content and performance if the teacher
34 would have been required to teach or enforce the course or standard as of the
