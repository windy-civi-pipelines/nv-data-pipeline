AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising provisions relating to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Interlocal Cooperation Act authorizes a public agency of this State to enter into a
2 joint or cooperative agreement with any other public agency of this State, another state, the
3 Federal Government or an Indian tribe, group of tribes, organized segment of a tribe or any
4 organization representing such tribal entities to exercise any power, privilege or authority
5 capable of being exercised by such a public agency. (NRS 277.100, 277.110) Existing law
6 also authorizes one or more such public agencies to contract with any one or more other
7 public agencies to perform any governmental service, activity or undertaking which any of the
8 public agencies are authorized to perform. (NRS 277.180) Section 1 of this bill [requires]
9 provides that, if a tribal government wishes to enter into a joint or cooperative agreement or
10 contract with the governing body of a county or agency thereof for the performance of any
11 service, activity or undertaking, the governing body of the county, on behalf of the county or
12 agency thereof, [must] may engage in discussions in good faith with the tribal government. If
13 the governing body enters into such an agreement or contract with a tribal government,
14 section 1 requires that the agreement be a conditional interlocal agreement which: (1) does not
15 require the tribal government to waive sovereign immunity; and (2) authorizes the governing
16 body of the county to terminate the agreement with 90 days’ advance notice to the tribal
17 government under certain circumstances.
18 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill add the provisions of section 1 to the Interlocal Cooperation
19 Act and purpose of the Act.
20 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in the Interlocal Cooperation Act relating to
21 the Act to the provisions of section 1.
