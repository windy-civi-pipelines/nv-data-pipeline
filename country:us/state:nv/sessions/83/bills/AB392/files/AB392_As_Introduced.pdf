AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions relating to certain interlocal agreements and
contracts between tribal governments and certain public
agencies; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Interlocal Cooperation Act authorizes a public agency of this State to enter
2 into a joint or cooperative agreement with any other public agency of this State,
3 another state, the Federal Government or an Indian tribe, group of tribes, organized
4 segment of a tribe or any organization representing such tribal entities to exercise
5 any power, privilege or authority capable of being exercised by such a public
6 agency. (NRS 277.100, 277.110) Existing law also authorizes one or more such
7 public agencies to contract with any one or more other public agencies to perform
8 any governmental service, activity or undertaking which any of the public agencies
9 are authorized to perform. (NRS 277.180) Section 1 of this bill requires that, if a
10 tribal government wishes to enter into a joint or cooperative agreement or contract
11 with the governing body of a county or agency thereof for the performance of any
12 service, activity or undertaking, the governing body of the county, on behalf of the
13 county or agency thereof, must engage in discussions in good faith with the tribal
14 government. If the governing body enters into such an agreement or contract with a
15 tribal government, section 1 requires that the agreement be a conditional interlocal
16 agreement which: (1) does not require the tribal government to waive sovereign
17 immunity; and (2) authorizes the governing body of the county to terminate the
18 agreement with 90 days’ advance notice to the tribal government under certain
19 circumstances.
20 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill add the provisions of section 1 to the Interlocal
21 Cooperation Act and purpose of the Act.
