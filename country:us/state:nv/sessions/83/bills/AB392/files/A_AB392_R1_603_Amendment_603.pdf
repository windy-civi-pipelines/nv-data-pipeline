AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising provisions relating to
certain interlocal agreements and contracts between tribal governments
and certain public agencies; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Interlocal Cooperation Act authorizes a public agency of this State to enter into a
2 joint or cooperative agreement with any other public agency of this State, another state, the
3 Federal Government or an Indian tribe, group of tribes, organized segment of a tribe or any
4 organization representing such tribal entities to exercise any power, privilege or authority
5 capable of being exercised by such a public agency. (NRS 277.100, 277.110) Existing law
6 also authorizes one or more such public agencies to contract with any one or more other
7 public agencies to perform any governmental service, activity or undertaking which any of the
8 public agencies are authorized to perform. (NRS 277.180) Section 1 of this bill provides that,
9 if a tribal government wishes to enter into a joint or cooperative agreement or contract with
10 the governing body of a county or agency thereof for the performance of any service, activity
11 or undertaking, the governing body of the county, on behalf of the county or agency thereof,
12 may engage in discussions in good faith with the tribal government. If the governing body
13 enters into such an agreement or contract with a tribal government, section 1 requires that the
14 agreement be a conditional interlocal agreement which: (1) does not require the tribal
15 government to waive sovereign immunity; and (2) authorizes the governing body of the
16 county to terminate the agreement with 90 days’ advance notice to the tribal government
17 under certain circumstances.
18 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill add the provisions of section 1 to the Interlocal Cooperation
19 Act and purpose of the Act.
20 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in the Interlocal Cooperation Act relating to
21 the Act to the provisions of section 1.
