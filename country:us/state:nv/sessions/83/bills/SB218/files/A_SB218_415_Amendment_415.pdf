AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; enacting the Uniform Antitrust Pre-
Merger Notification Act; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires certain
2 persons who intend to engage in certain mergers or acquisitions to file a notification with the
3 Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice. (15 U.S.C. § 18a)
4 Under existing state law, a person who is required to file such a notification for any
5 transaction involving any assets of a group practice or health carrier in this State is required to
6 simultaneously submit a copy of the filing to the Attorney General. (NRS 598A.400) This bill
7 enacts the Uniform Antitrust Pre-Merger Notification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law
8 Commission in 2024, which, in general, requires certain additional persons who are required
9 to file a notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to file that same notification with the
10 Attorney General contemporaneously with the federal filing.
11 Sections 4-11 of this bill define terms for the purposes of the Uniform Act. Section 12 of
12 this bill requires a person who files a notification pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to file
13 a copy of the federal notification form with the Attorney General if: (1) the person has its
14 principal place of business in this State; or (2) the person or a person it controls directly or
15 indirectly had a certain amount of annual net sales of certain goods or services in this State.
16 Section 12 also requires a person to file with the Attorney General a complete electronic copy
17 of any additional documentary material provided with the federal filing: (1)
18 contemporaneously with the federal filing, for a person with its principal place of business in
19 this State; and (2) on request of the Attorney General, for a person who meets the annual net
20 sales threshold. Section 12 further prohibits the Attorney General from charging a fee for such
21 filings. Section 15 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General to seek imposition of a civil
22 penalty if a person fails to submit the required filings and additional documentary material.
23 Section 12 exempts certain gaming licensees and affiliates of such licensees from the
24 requirements of section 12.
25 Sections 13 and 19 of this bill, in general, make such filings confidential subject to
26 certain exceptions. Sections 13 and 14 of this bill authorize limited disclosures for
27 investigatory and law enforcement purposes, including: (1) subject to a protective order
28 entered by an agency, court or judicial officer; (2) to the attorney general of another state
29 which has enacted the Uniform Act or an equivalent act with equivalent confidentiality
30 provisions; and (3) to certain federal agencies. Section 16 of this bill requires a court to

Senate Amendment No. 415 to Senate Bill No. 218 Page 4
31 consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact the Uniform
32 Act in applying and construing the provisions of the Uniform Act.
33 Existing law requires a person who is a party to certain reportable health care or health
34 carrier transactions to file a notification with the Attorney General at least 30 days before the
35 consummation of the transaction. (NRS 598A.390) Section 17 of this bill provides that the
36 requirement for notification is satisfied if the person is required to file a copy of a filing
37 regarding the transaction with the Attorney General pursuant to section 12 and does so.
38 Section 18 of this bill specifies that the provisions of existing law requiring a person to
39 simultaneously submit to the Attorney General a notification required by the Hart-Scott-
40 Rodino Act for a transaction involving any assets of a group practice or health carrier in this
41 State apply only if the person is not otherwise required to file a copy of the notification with
42 the Attorney General pursuant to the provisions of section 12.

25 710.159, 711.600, section 13 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
26 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
27 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
28 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
29 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
30 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
31 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
32 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
33 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
34 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
35 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
36 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
37 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
38 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
39 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
40 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
41 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
42 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
43 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
44 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
45 record that is not otherwise confidential.
46 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
47 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
48 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
49 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
50 (a) The public record:
51 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
52 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or

Senate Amendment No. 415 to Senate Bill No. 218 Page 9
1 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
2 electronic medium would:
3 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
4 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
5 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
6 otherwise confidential.
7 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
8 custody or control of a public record:
9 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
10 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
11 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
12 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
13 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
14 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
15 Sec. 20. 1. The provisions of this act apply only to a pre-merger
16 notification filed on or after October 1, 2025.
17 2. As used in this section, “pre-merger notification” has the meaning ascribed
18 to it in section 10 of this act.
