AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; enacting the Uniform
Antitrust Pre-Merger Notification Act; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires
2 certain persons who intend to engage in certain mergers or acquisitions to file a
3 notification with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department
4 of Justice. (15 U.S.C. § 18a) Under existing law, a person who is required to file
5 such a notification for any transaction involving any assets of a group practice or
6 health carrier in this State is required to simultaneously submit a copy of the filing
7 to the Attorney General. (NRS 598A.400) This bill enacts the Uniform Antitrust
8 Pre-Merger Notification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission in
9 2024, which, in general, requires certain additional persons who are required to file
10 a notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to file that same notification with
11 the Attorney General contemporaneously with the federal filing.
12 Sections 2-11 of this bill define terms for the purposes of the Uniform Act.
13 Section 12 of this bill requires a person who files a notification pursuant to the
14 Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to file a copy of the federal notification form with the
15 Attorney General if: (1) the person has its principal place of business in this State;
16 or (2) the person or a person it controls directly or indirectly had a certain amount
17 of annual net sales of certain goods or services in this State. Section 12 also
18 requires a person to file with the Attorney General a complete electronic copy of
19 any additional documentary material provided with the federal filing: (1)
20 contemporaneously with the federal filing, for a person with its principal place of
21 business in this State; and (2) on request of the Attorney General, for a person who
22 meets the annual net sales threshold. Section 12 further prohibits the Attorney
23 General from charging a fee for such filings. Section 15 of this bill authorizes the
24 Attorney General to seek imposition of a civil penalty if a person fails to submit the
25 required filings and additional documentary material.
26 Sections 13 and 19 of this bill, in general, make such filings confidential
27 subject to certain exceptions. Sections 13 and 14 of this bill authorize limited
-

28 disclosures for investigatory and law enforcement purposes, including: (1) subject
29 to a protective order entered by an agency, court or judicial officer; (2) to the
30 attorney general of another state which has enacted the Uniform Act or an
31 equivalent act with equivalent confidentiality provisions; and (3) to certain federal
32 agencies. Section 16 of this bill requires a court to consider the promotion of
33 uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Act in applying
34 and construing the provisions of the Act.
35 Existing law requires a person who is a party to certain reportable health care or
36 health carrier transactions to file a notification with the Attorney General at least 30
37 days before the consummation of the transaction. (NRS 598A.390) Section 17 of
38 this bill provides that the requirement for notification is satisfied if the person is
39 required to file a copy of a filing regarding the transaction with the Attorney
40 General pursuant to section 12 and does so.
41 Section 18 of this bill specifies that the provisions of existing law requiring a
42 person to simultaneously submit to the Attorney General a notification required by
43 the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for a transaction involving any assets of a group practice
44 or health carrier in this State apply only if the person is not otherwise required to
45 file a copy of the notification with the Attorney General pursuant to the provisions
46 of section 12.

S.B. 218
SENATE BILL NO. 218–SENATOR OHRENSCHALL
FEBRUARY 19, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Enacts the Uniform Antitrust Pre-Merger
Notification Act. (BDR 52-938)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; enacting the Uniform
Antitrust Pre-Merger Notification Act; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires
2 certain persons who intend to engage in certain mergers or acquisitions to file a
3 notification with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department
4 of Justice. (15 U.S.C. § 18a) Under existing law, a person who is required to file
5 such a notification for any transaction involving any assets of a group practice or
6 health carrier in this State is required to simultaneously submit a copy of the filing
7 to the Attorney General. (NRS 598A.400) This bill enacts the Uniform Antitrust
8 Pre-Merger Notification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission in
9 2024, which, in general, requires certain additional persons who are required to file
10 a notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to file that same notification with
11 the Attorney General contemporaneously with the federal filing.
12 Sections 2-11 of this bill define terms for the purposes of the Uniform Act.
13 Section 12 of this bill requires a person who files a notification pursuant to the
14 Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to file a copy of the federal notification form with the
15 Attorney General if: (1) the person has its principal place of business in this State;
16 or (2) the person or a person it controls directly or indirectly had a certain amount
17 of annual net sales of certain goods or services in this State. Section 12 also
18 requires a person to file with the Attorney General a complete electronic copy of
19 any additional documentary material provided with the federal filing: (1)
20 contemporaneously with the federal filing, for a person with its principal place of
21 business in this State; and (2) on request of the Attorney General, for a person who
22 meets the annual net sales threshold. Section 12 further prohibits the Attorney
23 General from charging a fee for such filings. Section 15 of this bill authorizes the
24 Attorney General to seek imposition of a civil penalty if a person fails to submit the
25 required filings and additional documentary material.
26 Sections 13 and 19 of this bill, in general, make such filings confidential
27 subject to certain exceptions. Sections 13 and 14 of this bill authorize limited
-
*SB218*

– 2 –
28 disclosures for investigatory and law enforcement purposes, including: (1) subject
29 to a protective order entered by an agency, court or judicial officer; (2) to the
30 attorney general of another state which has enacted the Uniform Act or an
31 equivalent act with equivalent confidentiality provisions; and (3) to certain federal
32 agencies. Section 16 of this bill requires a court to consider the promotion of
33 uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Act in applying
34 and construing the provisions of the Act.
35 Existing law requires a person who is a party to certain reportable health care or
36 health carrier transactions to file a notification with the Attorney General at least 30
37 days before the consummation of the transaction. (NRS 598A.390) Section 17 of
38 this bill provides that the requirement for notification is satisfied if the person is
39 required to file a copy of a filing regarding the transaction with the Attorney
40 General pursuant to section 12 and does so.
41 Section 18 of this bill specifies that the provisions of existing law requiring a
42 person to simultaneously submit to the Attorney General a notification required by
43 the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for a transaction involving any assets of a group practice
44 or health carrier in this State apply only if the person is not otherwise required to
45 file a copy of the notification with the Attorney General pursuant to the provisions
46 of section 12.

11 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
