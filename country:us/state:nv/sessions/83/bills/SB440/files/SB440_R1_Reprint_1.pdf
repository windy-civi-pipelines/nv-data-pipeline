EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; establishing a process by which a
unit’s owner in certain unit-owners’ associations may
submit a request to install a distributed generation system;
establishing certain powers and duties of certain unit-
owners’ associations with respect to the installation of
distributed generation systems; establishing and revising
certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for
the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system
and a power purchase agreement; revising provisions
relating to net metering systems; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
2 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
3 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
4 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
5 598.9822) Section 14 of this bill makes a power purchase agreement voidable by
6 the host customer for a certain period if the solar installation company that is a
7 party to the agreement does not hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting
8 within the monetary limit of that license.
9 Sections 15-20 of this bill require an agreement for the lease or purchase of a
10 distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover page for
11 such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation
12 company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the distributed
13 generation system; and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on lessees,
14 purchasers and host customers.
15 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of
16 certain communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than
17 4 years after the final inspection of the distributed generation system of the
-
*SB440_R1*

– 2 –
18 purchaser, lessee or host customer. (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 requires the solar
19 installation company to provide a copy of that recording within 5 days after receipt
20 of a request from the purchaser, lessee or host customer or a governmental entity. If
21 the solar installation company fails to do so, the lease or purchase agreement or
22 power purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
23 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or
24 conditions contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit
25 or unreasonably restrict an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining
26 solar energy on his or her property. (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13.3 of this
27 bill sets forth a process by which a unit’s owner in a unit-owners’ association
28 whose governing documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on
29 architectural improvements may submit a request to install a distributed generation
30 system. Section 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed
31 generation system unless the association approves the request.
32 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents
33 authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to
34 adopt rules and regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation
35 system and sets forth the required and authorized contents of such rules and
36 regulations. Under section 13.3, if such an association has not adopted such rules
37 and regulations, the association is prohibited from denying the request of a unit’s
38 owner to install a distributed generation system or imposing conditions upon the
39 installation. Section 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association
40 with respect to certain accessories for a distributed generation system.
41 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is
42 defined under existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the
43 electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a
44 customer-generator that is fed back to the utility; and (2) a net metering system,
45 which is defined under existing law to mean, in general, certain facilities or systems
46 for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy system installed on
47 the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate electricity
48 and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
49 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of
50 certain requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-
51 generator. Section 28 of this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public
52 Utilities Commission of Nevada relating to net metering tariffs and standard net
53 metering contracts to set forth procedures and requirements concerning the process
54 for applying for and installing a net metering system, which must include: (1)
55 reasonable and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) the requirement for a
56 utility that denies the application of a net metering applicant to provide to the net
57 metering applicant a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
58 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and
59 quality standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards,
60 prohibits a utility from requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional
61 standards or requirements or take certain other actions solely because of his or her
62 status as a customer-generator. (NRS 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally
63 requires a customer-generator to obtain all necessary permits and approvals
64 required by any governmental entity for the installation of his or her net metering
65 system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits and
66 approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various
67 additional requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and
68 the net metering system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing
69 law.
