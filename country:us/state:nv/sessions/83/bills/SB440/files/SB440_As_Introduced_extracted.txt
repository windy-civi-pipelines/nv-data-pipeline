Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
2 the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain
3 exceptions, existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending
4 without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS
5 675.060) Section 11 of this bill additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the
6 business of a distributed generation system financier without being licensed by the
7 Commissioner as an installment lender. Section 10 of this bill defines the term
8 “distributed generation system financier,” in general, to mean a person who: (1)
-
*SB440*
– 2 –
9 provides a loan to finance the purchase of a distributed generation system, which
10 section 10 designates as a “distributed generation system loan”; or (2) leases a
11 distributed generation system.
12 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
13 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
14 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
15 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
16 598.9822) Sections 2-22 of this bill impose various requirements on distributed
17 generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an agreement for the
18 provision of a distributed generation system loan, a lease for a distributed
19 generation system and a power purchase agreement.
20 Section 6 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
21 solar installation company that installs a distributed generation system that is leased
22 by or for which a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the
23 financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
24 limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
25 loan or lease agreement is voidable by the borrower or lessee for a certain period.
26 Similarly, section 14 makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host
27 customer for a certain period if the solar installation company that is a party to the
28 agreement does not hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the
29 monetary limit of that license.
30 Section 7 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from making
31 certain payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation
32 system has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the
33 power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has received a
34 final inspection. Section 7 additionally sets forth requirements for when a
35 distributed generation system financier is required to pay money owed to a solar
36 installation company.
37 Section 12 revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales
38 so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers
39 who engage in certain activities. (NRS 97.125)
40 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system and
41 a host customer who enters into a power purchase agreement have the right to
42 rescind the lease agreement, purchase agreement or power purchase agreement
43 within 3 business days after the agreement is signed or entered into. (NRS
44 598.98216) Sections 8, 9, 15-20 and 22 provide that a borrower, lessee, purchaser
45 or host customer may rescind an agreement for the provision of a distributed
46 generation system loan, lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement
47 within: (1) 3 business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; or
48 (2) 5 business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older.
49 Sections 8, 16 and 18 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not
50 required to pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar
51 installation company before the distributed generation system has received
52 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the
53 system will not be connected to the power grid, has received a final inspection.
54 Sections 8, 15 and 19 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed
55 generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a
56 distributed generation system or power purchase agreement to prominently display
57 at the top of the agreement or cover page the length of the term of the loan, lease or
58 agreement and a description of the consequences if the borrower, lessee or host
59 customer dies, becomes disabled or sells the property to which the distributed
60 generation system is affixed during the term of the loan, lease or agreement.
61 Sections 8, 9, 15-20 and 22 additionally require an agreement for the lease or
62 purchase of a distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the
63 cover page for such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the
-
*SB440*
– 3 –
64 solar installation company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the
65 distributed generation system; and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on
66 lessees, purchasers and host customers.
67 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of
68 certain communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than
69 4 years after the final inspection of the distributed generation system of the
70 purchaser, lessee or host customer. (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 requires the solar
71 installation company to provide a copy of that recording within 5 days after receipt
72 of a request from the purchaser, lessee or host customer or a governmental entity. If
73 the solar installation company fails to do so, the lease or purchase agreement or
74 power purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
75 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or
76 conditions contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit
77 or unreasonably restrict an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining
78 solar energy on his or her property. (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13 prohibits
79 the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest community from: (1) imposing
80 certain requirements concerning the particular location within a unit at which a
81 distributed generation system may be installed under certain circumstances; and (2)
82 unreasonably restricting, prohibiting or withholding approval for a unit’s owner to
83 install a distributed generation system on a roof that covers only the unit of the
84 unit’s owner, regardless of whether the roof is a common element. Section 13
85 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association with respect to certain
86 accessories for a distributed generation system.
87 Existing law sets forth procedures and requirements for a public utility to make
88 changes to a schedule of rates. (NRS 704.061-704.140) Section 24 of this bill
89 requires an electric utility to post on its Internet website certain information
90 concerning certain proposed increases in rates and periods of peak demand for
91 electricity within a certain period before the increase is proposed to take effect and,
92 for information concerning periods of peak demand for electricity, annually.
93 Section 26 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions applicable
94 to the provisions of existing law governing rates and schedules apply to section 24.
95 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is
96 defined under existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the
97 electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a
98 customer-generator that is fed back to the utility; and (2) a net metering system,
99 which is defined under existing law to mean, in general, certain facilities or systems
100 for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy system installed on
101 the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate electricity
102 and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
103 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of
104 certain requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-
105 generator. Section 28 of this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public
106 Utilities Commission of Nevada relating to net metering tariffs and standard net
107 metering contracts to require a utility to: (1) approve or deny the application of a
108 net metering applicant within 5 business days after receipt of the application; and
109 (2) if the utility denies the application, provide to the net metering applicant a
110 notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
111 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and
112 quality standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards,
113 prohibits a utility from requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional
114 standards or requirements or take certain other actions solely because of his or her
115 status as a customer-generator. (NRS 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally
116 requires a customer-generator to obtain all necessary permits and approvals
117 required by any governmental entity for the installation of his or her net metering
118 system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits and
-
*SB440*
– 4 –
119 approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various
120 additional requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and
121 the net metering system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing
122 law.

S.B. 440
SENATE BILL NO. 440–COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to electricity.
(BDR 55-950)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; requiring a distributed generation
system financier to obtain a license as an installment
lender; imposing various requirements upon a distributed
generation system financer who finances the purchase of
or leases a distributed generation system; revising certain
requirements for solar installation companies that sell and
install distributed generation systems; establishing and
revising certain requirements for the contents of an
agreement for the provision of a distributed generation
system loan, an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
distributed generation system and a power purchase
agreement; prohibiting a unit-owners’ association from
imposing certain requirements and restrictions concerning
distributed generation systems; requiring an electric utility
to post certain information on an Internet website
maintained by the electric utility; revising provisions
relating to net metering systems; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
2 the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain
3 exceptions, existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending
4 without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS
5 675.060) Section 11 of this bill additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the
6 business of a distributed generation system financier without being licensed by the
7 Commissioner as an installment lender. Section 10 of this bill defines the term
8 “distributed generation system financier,” in general, to mean a person who: (1)
-
*SB440*

– 2 –
9 provides a loan to finance the purchase of a distributed generation system, which
10 section 10 designates as a “distributed generation system loan”; or (2) leases a
11 distributed generation system.
12 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
13 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
14 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
15 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
16 598.9822) Sections 2-22 of this bill impose various requirements on distributed
17 generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an agreement for the
18 provision of a distributed generation system loan, a lease for a distributed
19 generation system and a power purchase agreement.
20 Section 6 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
21 solar installation company that installs a distributed generation system that is leased
22 by or for which a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the
23 financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
24 limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
25 loan or lease agreement is voidable by the borrower or lessee for a certain period.
26 Similarly, section 14 makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host
27 customer for a certain period if the solar installation company that is a party to the
28 agreement does not hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the
29 monetary limit of that license.
30 Section 7 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from making
31 certain payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation
32 system has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the
33 power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has received a
34 final inspection. Section 7 additionally sets forth requirements for when a
35 distributed generation system financier is required to pay money owed to a solar
36 installation company.
37 Section 12 revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales
38 so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers
39 who engage in certain activities. (NRS 97.125)
40 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system and
41 a host customer who enters into a power purchase agreement have the right to
42 rescind the lease agreement, purchase agreement or power purchase agreement
43 within 3 business days after the agreement is signed or entered into. (NRS
44 598.98216) Sections 8, 9, 15-20 and 22 provide that a borrower, lessee, purchaser
45 or host customer may rescind an agreement for the provision of a distributed
46 generation system loan, lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement
47 within: (1) 3 business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; or
48 (2) 5 business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older.
49 Sections 8, 16 and 18 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not
50 required to pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar
51 installation company before the distributed generation system has received
52 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the
53 system will not be connected to the power grid, has received a final inspection.
54 Sections 8, 15 and 19 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed
55 generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a
56 distributed generation system or power purchase agreement to prominently display
57 at the top of the agreement or cover page the length of the term of the loan, lease or
58 agreement and a description of the consequences if the borrower, lessee or host
59 customer dies, becomes disabled or sells the property to which the distributed
60 generation system is affixed during the term of the loan, lease or agreement.
61 Sections 8, 9, 15-20 and 22 additionally require an agreement for the lease or
62 purchase of a distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the
63 cover page for such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the

– 3 –
64 solar installation company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the
65 distributed generation system; and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on
66 lessees, purchasers and host customers.
67 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of
68 certain communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than
69 4 years after the final inspection of the distributed generation system of the
70 purchaser, lessee or host customer. (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 requires the solar
71 installation company to provide a copy of that recording within 5 days after receipt
72 of a request from the purchaser, lessee or host customer or a governmental entity. If
73 the solar installation company fails to do so, the lease or purchase agreement or
74 power purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
75 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or
76 conditions contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit
77 or unreasonably restrict an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining
78 solar energy on his or her property. (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13 prohibits
79 the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest community from: (1) imposing
80 certain requirements concerning the particular location within a unit at which a
81 distributed generation system may be installed under certain circumstances; and (2)
82 unreasonably restricting, prohibiting or withholding approval for a unit’s owner to
83 install a distributed generation system on a roof that covers only the unit of the
84 unit’s owner, regardless of whether the roof is a common element. Section 13
85 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association with respect to certain
86 accessories for a distributed generation system.
87 Existing law sets forth procedures and requirements for a public utility to make
88 changes to a schedule of rates. (NRS 704.061-704.140) Section 24 of this bill
89 requires an electric utility to post on its Internet website certain information
90 concerning certain proposed increases in rates and periods of peak demand for
91 electricity within a certain period before the increase is proposed to take effect and,
92 for information concerning periods of peak demand for electricity, annually.
93 Section 26 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions applicable
94 to the provisions of existing law governing rates and schedules apply to section 24.
95 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is
96 defined under existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the
97 electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a
98 customer-generator that is fed back to the utility; and (2) a net metering system,
99 which is defined under existing law to mean, in general, certain facilities or systems
100 for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy system installed on
101 the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate electricity
102 and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
103 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of
104 certain requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-
105 generator. Section 28 of this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public
106 Utilities Commission of Nevada relating to net metering tariffs and standard net
107 metering contracts to require a utility to: (1) approve or deny the application of a
108 net metering applicant within 5 business days after receipt of the application; and
109 (2) if the utility denies the application, provide to the net metering applicant a
110 notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
111 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and
112 quality standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards,
113 prohibits a utility from requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional
114 standards or requirements or take certain other actions solely because of his or her
115 status as a customer-generator. (NRS 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally
116 requires a customer-generator to obtain all necessary permits and approvals
117 required by any governmental entity for the installation of his or her net metering
118 system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits and
-
*SB440*

– 4 –
119 approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various
120 additional requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and
121 the net metering system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing
122 law.
