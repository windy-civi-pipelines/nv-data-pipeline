EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; establishing a process by which a unit’s owner in
certain unit-owners’ associations may submit a request to install a
distributed generation system; establishing certain powers and duties of
certain unit-owners’ associations with respect to the installation of
distributed generation systems; establishing and revising certain
requirements for the contents of an agreement for the purchase or lease
of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement;
imposing certain requirements upon a solar installation company;
revising provisions relating to net metering systems; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
2 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual
3 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
4 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 14.1-14.3 and 14.5 of this
5 bill define certain terms for the purposes of these provisions governing such agreements.
6 Section [14] 14.4 of this bill makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host
7 customer for a certain period if the solar installation company that is a party to the agreement
8 does not hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the monetary limit of that
9 license. Section 21.5 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the provisions of
10 sections 14.1-14.4 are enforced in the same manner as other provisions governing solar
11 installation companies and distributed generation systems.
12 Sections 15-20 of this bill require an agreement for the lease or purchase of a distributed
13 generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover page for such agreements to:
14 (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation company; (2) provide certain
15 information about the parts of the distributed generation system; and (3) impose certain duties
16 and liabilities on lessees, purchasers and host customers.
17 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of certain
18 communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than 4 years after the
19 final inspection of the distributed generation system of the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
20 (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 of this bill requires the solar installation company to provide a
21 copy of that recording within [5] 10 business days after receipt of a request from the
22 purchaser, lessee , [or] host customer [or a governmental entity.] , distributed generation
23 system financier, Attorney General, Division of Financial Institutions of the Department
24 of Business and Industry, State Contractors’ Board, Housing Division of the Department
Assembly Amendment No. 708 to Senate Bill No. 440 First Reprint Page 4
25 of Business and Industry or a law enforcement agency. If the solar installation company
26 fails to do so, the lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
27 purchaser, lessee or host customer. Section 21 also requires a solar installation company to
28 submit proof to the purchaser, lessee or host customer that the solar installation
29 company is properly licensed before the commencement of the installation of a
30 distributed generation system.
31 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or conditions
32 contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit or unreasonably restrict
33 an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining solar energy on his or her property.
34 (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13.3 of this bill sets forth a process by which a unit’s owner
35 in a unit-owners’ association whose governing documents authorize the association to impose
36 restrictions on architectural improvements may submit a request to install a distributed
37 generation system. Section 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed
38 generation system unless the association approves the request.
39 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents authorize
40 the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to adopt rules and
41 regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation system and sets forth the
42 required and authorized contents of such rules and regulations. Under section 13.3, if such an
43 association has not adopted such rules and regulations, the association is prohibited from
44 denying the request of a unit’s owner to install a distributed generation system or imposing
45 conditions upon the installation. Section 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an
46 association with respect to certain accessories for a distributed generation system.
47 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is defined under
48 existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the electricity supplied by an
49 electric utility and the electricity generated by a customer-generator that is fed back to the
50 utility; and (2) a net metering system, which is defined under existing law to mean, in general,
51 certain facilities or systems for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy
52 system installed on the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate
53 electricity and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
54 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of certain
55 requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-generator. Section 28 of
56 this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada
57 relating to net metering tariffs and standard net metering contracts to set forth procedures and
58 requirements concerning the process for applying for and installing a net metering system,
59 which must include: (1) reasonable and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) the
60 requirement for a utility that denies the application of a net metering applicant to provide to
61 the net metering applicant a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
62 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and quality
63 standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards, prohibits a utility from
64 requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional standards or requirements or take
65 certain other actions solely because of his or her status as a customer-generator. (NRS
66 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally requires a customer-generator to obtain all
67 necessary permits and approvals required by any governmental entity for the installation of his
68 or her net metering system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits
69 and approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various additional
70 requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and the net metering
71 system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing law.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; establishing a process by which a unit’s owner in
certain unit-owners’ associations may submit a request to install a
distributed generation system; establishing certain powers and duties of
certain unit-owners’ associations with respect to the installation of
distributed generation systems; establishing and revising certain
requirements for the contents of an agreement for the purchase or lease
of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement;
imposing certain requirements upon a solar installation company;
revising provisions relating to net metering systems; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
2 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual
3 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
4 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 14.1-14.3 and 14.5 of this
5 bill define certain terms for the purposes of these provisions governing such agreements.
6 Section [14] 14.4 of this bill makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host
7 customer for a certain period if the solar installation company that is a party to the agreement
8 does not hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the monetary limit of that
9 license. Section 21.5 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the provisions of
10 sections 14.1-14.4 are enforced in the same manner as other provisions governing solar
11 installation companies and distributed generation systems.
12 Sections 15-20 of this bill require an agreement for the lease or purchase of a distributed
13 generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover page for such agreements to:
14 (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation company; (2) provide certain
15 information about the parts of the distributed generation system; and (3) impose certain duties
16 and liabilities on lessees, purchasers and host customers.
17 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of certain
18 communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than 4 years after the
19 final inspection of the distributed generation system of the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
20 (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 of this bill requires the solar installation company to provide a
21 copy of that recording within [5] 10 business days after receipt of a request from the
22 purchaser, lessee , [or] host customer [or a governmental entity.] , distributed generation
23 system financier, Attorney General, Division of Financial Institutions of the Department
24 of Business and Industry, State Contractors’ Board, Housing Division of the Department

Assembly Amendment No. 708 to Senate Bill No. 440 First Reprint Page 4
25 of Business and Industry or a law enforcement agency. If the solar installation company
26 fails to do so, the lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
27 purchaser, lessee or host customer. Section 21 also requires a solar installation company to
28 submit proof to the purchaser, lessee or host customer that the solar installation
29 company is properly licensed before the commencement of the installation of a
30 distributed generation system.
31 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or conditions
32 contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit or unreasonably restrict
33 an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining solar energy on his or her property.
34 (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13.3 of this bill sets forth a process by which a unit’s owner
35 in a unit-owners’ association whose governing documents authorize the association to impose
36 restrictions on architectural improvements may submit a request to install a distributed
37 generation system. Section 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed
38 generation system unless the association approves the request.
39 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents authorize
40 the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to adopt rules and
41 regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation system and sets forth the
42 required and authorized contents of such rules and regulations. Under section 13.3, if such an
43 association has not adopted such rules and regulations, the association is prohibited from
44 denying the request of a unit’s owner to install a distributed generation system or imposing
45 conditions upon the installation. Section 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an
46 association with respect to certain accessories for a distributed generation system.
47 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is defined under
48 existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the electricity supplied by an
49 electric utility and the electricity generated by a customer-generator that is fed back to the
50 utility; and (2) a net metering system, which is defined under existing law to mean, in general,
51 certain facilities or systems for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy
52 system installed on the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate
53 electricity and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
54 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of certain
55 requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-generator. Section 28 of
56 this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada
57 relating to net metering tariffs and standard net metering contracts to set forth procedures and
58 requirements concerning the process for applying for and installing a net metering system,
59 which must include: (1) reasonable and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) the
60 requirement for a utility that denies the application of a net metering applicant to provide to
61 the net metering applicant a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
62 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and quality
63 standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards, prohibits a utility from
64 requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional standards or requirements or take
65 certain other actions solely because of his or her status as a customer-generator. (NRS
66 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally requires a customer-generator to obtain all
67 necessary permits and approvals required by any governmental entity for the installation of his
68 or her net metering system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits
69 and approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various additional
70 requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and the net metering
71 system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing law.

11 documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural
12 improvements who wishes to install a distributed generation system within such
13 physical portion of the common-interest community as that owner has a right to
14 occupy and use exclusively may submit a request to the association in accordance
15 with any applicable procedures set forth in the governing documents of the
16 association. The unit’s owner shall not install the distributed generation system
17 unless the association has approved the request.
18 2. An association that has adopted rules and regulations governing the
19 installation of a distributed generation system pursuant to section 13.7 of this act
20 shall approve or deny the request within 35 days after the receipt of the request. If
21 the association denies the request, the association shall provide the unit’s owner
22 a notice that details the reasons for the denial, which must be based on the rules
23 and regulations adopted by the association pursuant to section 13.7 of this act. If
24 the association fails to approve or deny the request within 35 days after the
25 receipt of the request, the request shall be deemed to be approved.
26 3. If a unit’s owner whose request to install a distributed generation system
27 was denied pursuant to subsection 2 subsequently resubmits the request and
28 addresses the reasons for the denial of the initial request, the association shall
29 approve or deny the request within 15 days after the receipt of the request. If the
30 association denies the request, the association shall provide the unit’s owner
31 notice that details the reasons for the denial, which must be based on the rules
32 and regulations adopted by the association pursuant to section 13.7 of this act. If
33 the association fails to approve or deny the request within 15 days after the
34 receipt of the request, the request shall be deemed to be approved.
35 4. An association that has not adopted rules and regulations governing the
36 installation of a distributed generation system pursuant to section 13.7 of this act
37 that receives a request submitted pursuant to subsection 1 shall approve the
38 request within 15 days after the receipt of the request. The association shall not
39 deny the request or impose any conditions upon the installation of the distributed
40 generation system. [If the association fails to approve the request within 15 days
41 after the receipt of the request, the request shall be deemed to be approved.]
42 5. If an association has adopted rules and regulations governing the
43 installation of a distributed generation system pursuant to section 13.7 of this act,
44 the association and each unit’s owner shall comply with the rules and
45 regulations.
46 6. As used in this section, “distributed generation system” has the meaning
47 ascribed to it in NRS 598.9804.
48 Sec. 13.7. 1. An association whose governing documents authorize the
49 association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements may adopt rules
50 and regulations governing the installation of distributed generation systems that
