Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by the
2 Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain exceptions,
3 existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending without being
4 licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS 675.060) Section 11 of this bill
5 additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of a distributed generation
6 system financier without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender.
7 Section 10 of this bill defines the term “distributed generation system financier,” in general, to
8 mean a person who: (1) provides a loan to finance the purchase of a distributed generation
9 system, which section 10 designates as a “distributed generation system loan”; or (2) leases a
10 distributed generation system.]
11 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
12 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual
Senate Amendment No. 343 to Senate Bill No. 440 Page 4
13 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
14 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) [Sections 2-22 of this bill impose
15 various requirements on distributed generation system financiers and contractual requirements
16 for an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, a lease for a
17 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
18 Section 6 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any solar
19 installation company that installs a distributed generation system that is leased by or for which
20 a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the financier holds the proper
21 contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary limit of that license. If a distributed
22 generation system financier fails to do so, the loan or lease agreement is voidable by the
23 borrower or lessee for a certain period. Similarly, section] Section 14 of this bill makes a
24 power purchase agreement voidable by the host customer for a certain period if the solar
25 installation company that is a party to the agreement does not hold the proper contractor’s
26 license or is not acting within the monetary limit of that license.
27 [Section 7 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from making certain
28 payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation system has received
29 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system
30 will not be connected to the power grid, has received a final inspection. Section 7 additionally
31 sets forth requirements for when a distributed generation system financier is required to pay
32 money owed to a solar installation company.
33 Section 12 revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales so that
34 such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers who engage in
35 certain activities. (NRS 97.125)
36 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system and a host
37 customer who enters into a power purchase agreement have the right to rescind the lease
38 agreement, purchase agreement or power purchase agreement within 3 business days after the
39 agreement is signed or entered into. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 8, 9, 15-20 and 22 provide that
40 a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer may rescind an agreement for the provision of
41 a distributed generation system loan, lease or purchase agreement or power purchase
42 agreement within: (1) 3 business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; or
43 (2) 5 business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older.
44 Sections 8, 16 and 18 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not required to
45 pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar installation company
46 before the distributed generation system has received permission from the appropriate public
47 utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid,
48 has received a final inspection.
49 Sections 8, 15 and 19 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation
50 system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
51 system or power purchase agreement to prominently display at the top of the agreement or
52 cover page the length of the term of the loan, lease or agreement and a description of the
53 consequences if the borrower, lessee or host customer dies, becomes disabled or sells the
54 property to which the distributed generation system is affixed during the term of the loan,
55 lease or agreement.]
56 Sections [8, 9,] 15-20 [and 22 additionally] of this bill require an agreement for the lease
57 or purchase of a distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover
58 page for such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation
59 company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the distributed generation system;
60 and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on lessees, purchasers and host customers.
61 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of certain
62 communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than 4 years after the
63 final inspection of the distributed generation system of the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
64 (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 requires the solar installation company to provide a copy of that
65 recording within 5 days after receipt of a request from the purchaser, lessee or host customer
66 or a governmental entity. If the solar installation company fails to do so, the lease or purchase
67 agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
68 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or conditions
69 contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit or unreasonably restrict
70 an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining solar energy on his or her property.
71 (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section [13 prohibits the unit-owners’ association of a common-
Senate Amendment No. 343 to Senate Bill No. 440 Page 5
72 interest community from: (1) imposing certain requirements concerning the particular location
73 within a unit at which a distributed generation system may be installed under certain
74 circumstances; and (2) unreasonably restricting, prohibiting or withholding approval for a
75 unit’s owner to install a distributed generation system on a roof that covers only the unit of the
76 unit’s owner, regardless of whether the roof is a common element.] 13.3 of this bill sets forth
77 a process by which a unit’s owner in a unit-owners’ association whose governing
78 documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural
79 improvements may submit a request to install a distributed generation system. Section
80 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed generation system unless
81 the association approves the request.
82 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents
83 authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to adopt
84 rules and regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation system and
85 sets forth the required and authorized contents of such rules and regulations. Under
86 section 13.3, if such an association has not adopted such rules and regulations, the
87 association is prohibited from denying the request of a unit’s owner to install a
88 distributed generation system or imposing conditions upon the installation. Section [13]
89 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association with respect to certain
90 accessories for a distributed generation system.
91 [Existing law sets forth procedures and requirements for a public utility to make changes
92 to a schedule of rates. (NRS 704.061-704.140) Section 24 of this bill requires an electric
93 utility to post on its Internet website certain information concerning certain proposed increases
94 in rates and periods of peak demand for electricity within a certain period before the increase
95 is proposed to take effect and, for information concerning periods of peak demand for
96 electricity, annually. Section 26 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
97 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing rates and schedules apply to section
98 24.]
99 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is defined under
100 existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the electricity supplied by an
101 electric utility and the electricity generated by a customer-generator that is fed back to the
102 utility; and (2) a net metering system, which is defined under existing law to mean, in general,
103 certain facilities or systems for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy
104 system installed on the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate
105 electricity and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
106 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of certain
107 requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-generator. Section 28 of
108 this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada
109 relating to net metering tariffs and standard net metering contracts to [require a utility to:] set
110 forth procedures and requirements concerning the process for applying for and
111 installing a net metering system, which must include: (1) [approve or deny the application
112 of a net metering applicant within 5 business days after receipt of the application;] reasonable
113 and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) [if] the requirement for a utility that
114 denies the application [,] of a net metering applicant to provide to the net metering applicant
115 a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
116 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and quality
117 standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards, prohibits a utility from
118 requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional standards or requirements or take
119 certain other actions solely because of his or her status as a customer-generator. (NRS
120 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally requires a customer-generator to obtain all
121 necessary permits and approvals required by any governmental entity for the installation of his
122 or her net metering system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits
123 and approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various additional
124 requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and the net metering
125 system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing law.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; [requiring a distributed generation system financier
to obtain a license as an installment lender; imposing various
requirements upon a distributed generation system financer who
finances the purchase of or leases a distributed generation system;
revising certain requirements for solar installation companies that sell
and install] establishing a process by which a unit’s owner in
certain unit-owners’ associations may submit a request to install a
distributed generation system; establishing certain powers and
duties of certain unit-owners’ associations with respect to the
installation of distributed generation systems; establishing and
revising certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for [the
provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement for] the
purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power
purchase agreement; [prohibiting a unit-owners’ association from
imposing certain requirements and restrictions concerning distributed
generation systems; requiring an electric utility to post certain
information on an Internet website maintained by the electric utility;]
revising provisions relating to net metering systems; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by the
2 Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain exceptions,
3 existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending without being
4 licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS 675.060) Section 11 of this bill
5 additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of a distributed generation
6 system financier without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender.
7 Section 10 of this bill defines the term “distributed generation system financier,” in general, to
8 mean a person who: (1) provides a loan to finance the purchase of a distributed generation
9 system, which section 10 designates as a “distributed generation system loan”; or (2) leases a
10 distributed generation system.]
11 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
12 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual

Senate Amendment No. 343 to Senate Bill No. 440 Page 4
13 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
14 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) [Sections 2-22 of this bill impose
15 various requirements on distributed generation system financiers and contractual requirements
16 for an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, a lease for a
17 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
18 Section 6 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any solar
19 installation company that installs a distributed generation system that is leased by or for which
20 a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the financier holds the proper
21 contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary limit of that license. If a distributed
22 generation system financier fails to do so, the loan or lease agreement is voidable by the
23 borrower or lessee for a certain period. Similarly, section] Section 14 of this bill makes a
24 power purchase agreement voidable by the host customer for a certain period if the solar
25 installation company that is a party to the agreement does not hold the proper contractor’s
26 license or is not acting within the monetary limit of that license.
27 [Section 7 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from making certain
28 payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation system has received
29 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system
30 will not be connected to the power grid, has received a final inspection. Section 7 additionally
31 sets forth requirements for when a distributed generation system financier is required to pay
32 money owed to a solar installation company.
33 Section 12 revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales so that
34 such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers who engage in
35 certain activities. (NRS 97.125)
36 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system and a host
37 customer who enters into a power purchase agreement have the right to rescind the lease
38 agreement, purchase agreement or power purchase agreement within 3 business days after the
39 agreement is signed or entered into. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 8, 9, 15-20 and 22 provide that
40 a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer may rescind an agreement for the provision of
41 a distributed generation system loan, lease or purchase agreement or power purchase
42 agreement within: (1) 3 business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; or
43 (2) 5 business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older.
44 Sections 8, 16 and 18 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not required to
45 pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar installation company
46 before the distributed generation system has received permission from the appropriate public
47 utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid,
48 has received a final inspection.
49 Sections 8, 15 and 19 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation
50 system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
51 system or power purchase agreement to prominently display at the top of the agreement or
52 cover page the length of the term of the loan, lease or agreement and a description of the
53 consequences if the borrower, lessee or host customer dies, becomes disabled or sells the
54 property to which the distributed generation system is affixed during the term of the loan,
55 lease or agreement.]
56 Sections [8, 9,] 15-20 [and 22 additionally] of this bill require an agreement for the lease
57 or purchase of a distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover
58 page for such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation
59 company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the distributed generation system;
60 and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on lessees, purchasers and host customers.
61 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of certain
62 communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than 4 years after the
63 final inspection of the distributed generation system of the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
64 (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 requires the solar installation company to provide a copy of that
65 recording within 5 days after receipt of a request from the purchaser, lessee or host customer
66 or a governmental entity. If the solar installation company fails to do so, the lease or purchase
67 agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
68 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or conditions
69 contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit or unreasonably restrict
70 an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining solar energy on his or her property.
71 (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section [13 prohibits the unit-owners’ association of a common-

Senate Amendment No. 343 to Senate Bill No. 440 Page 5
72 interest community from: (1) imposing certain requirements concerning the particular location
73 within a unit at which a distributed generation system may be installed under certain
74 circumstances; and (2) unreasonably restricting, prohibiting or withholding approval for a
75 unit’s owner to install a distributed generation system on a roof that covers only the unit of the
76 unit’s owner, regardless of whether the roof is a common element.] 13.3 of this bill sets forth
77 a process by which a unit’s owner in a unit-owners’ association whose governing
78 documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural
79 improvements may submit a request to install a distributed generation system. Section
80 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed generation system unless
81 the association approves the request.
82 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents
83 authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to adopt
84 rules and regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation system and
85 sets forth the required and authorized contents of such rules and regulations. Under
86 section 13.3, if such an association has not adopted such rules and regulations, the
87 association is prohibited from denying the request of a unit’s owner to install a
88 distributed generation system or imposing conditions upon the installation. Section [13]
89 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association with respect to certain
90 accessories for a distributed generation system.
91 [Existing law sets forth procedures and requirements for a public utility to make changes
92 to a schedule of rates. (NRS 704.061-704.140) Section 24 of this bill requires an electric
93 utility to post on its Internet website certain information concerning certain proposed increases
94 in rates and periods of peak demand for electricity within a certain period before the increase
95 is proposed to take effect and, for information concerning periods of peak demand for
96 electricity, annually. Section 26 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
97 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing rates and schedules apply to section
98 24.]
99 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is defined under
100 existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the electricity supplied by an
101 electric utility and the electricity generated by a customer-generator that is fed back to the
102 utility; and (2) a net metering system, which is defined under existing law to mean, in general,
103 certain facilities or systems for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy
104 system installed on the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate
105 electricity and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
106 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of certain
107 requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-generator. Section 28 of
108 this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada
109 relating to net metering tariffs and standard net metering contracts to [require a utility to:] set
110 forth procedures and requirements concerning the process for applying for and
111 installing a net metering system, which must include: (1) [approve or deny the application
112 of a net metering applicant within 5 business days after receipt of the application;] reasonable
113 and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) [if] the requirement for a utility that
114 denies the application [,] of a net metering applicant to provide to the net metering applicant
115 a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
116 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and quality
117 standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards, prohibits a utility from
118 requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional standards or requirements or take
119 certain other actions solely because of his or her status as a customer-generator. (NRS
120 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally requires a customer-generator to obtain all
121 necessary permits and approvals required by any governmental entity for the installation of his
122 or her net metering system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits
123 and approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various additional
124 requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and the net metering
125 system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing law.
