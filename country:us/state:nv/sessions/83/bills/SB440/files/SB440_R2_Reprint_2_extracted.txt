EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; establishing a process by which a
unit’s owner in certain unit-owners’ associations may
submit a request to install a distributed generation system;
establishing certain powers and duties of certain unit-
owners’ associations with respect to the installation of
distributed generation systems; establishing and revising
certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for
the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system
and a power purchase agreement; imposing certain
requirements upon a solar installation company; revising
provisions relating to net metering systems; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
2 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
3 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
4 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
5 598.9822) Sections 14.1-14.3 and 14.5 of this bill define certain terms for the
6 purposes of these provisions governing such agreements. Section 14.4 of this bill
7 makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host customer for a certain
8 period if the solar installation company that is a party to the agreement does not
9 hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the monetary limit of
10 that license. Section 21.5 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the
11 provisions of sections 14.1-14.4 are enforced in the same manner as other
12 provisions governing solar installation companies and distributed generation
13 systems.
14 Sections 15-20 of this bill require an agreement for the lease or purchase of a
15 distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover page for
16 such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation
-

– 2 –
17 company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the distributed
18 generation system; and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on lessees,
19 purchasers and host customers.
20 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of
21 certain communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than
22 4 years after the final inspection of the distributed generation system of the
23 purchaser, lessee or host customer. (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 of this bill
24 requires the solar installation company to provide a copy of that recording within
25 10 business days after receipt of a request from the purchaser, lessee, host
26 customer, distributed generation system financier, Attorney General, Division of
27 Financial Institutions of the Department of Business and Industry, State
28 Contractors’ Board, Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
29 or a law enforcement agency. If the solar installation company fails to do so, the
30 lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
31 purchaser, lessee or host customer. Section 21 also requires a solar installation
32 company to submit proof to the purchaser, lessee or host customer that the solar
33 installation company is properly licensed before the commencement of the
34 installation of a distributed generation system.
35 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or
36 conditions contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit
37 or unreasonably restrict an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining
38 solar energy on his or her property. (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13.3 of this
39 bill sets forth a process by which a unit’s owner in a unit-owners’ association
40 whose governing documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on
41 architectural improvements may submit a request to install a distributed generation
42 system. Section 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed
43 generation system unless the association approves the request.
44 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents
45 authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to
46 adopt rules and regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation
47 system and sets forth the required and authorized contents of such rules and
48 regulations. Under section 13.3, if such an association has not adopted such rules
49 and regulations, the association is prohibited from denying the request of a unit’s
50 owner to install a distributed generation system or imposing conditions upon the
51 installation. Section 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association
52 with respect to certain accessories for a distributed generation system.
53 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is
54 defined under existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the
55 electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a
56 customer-generator that is fed back to the utility; and (2) a net metering system,
57 which is defined under existing law to mean, in general, certain facilities or systems
58 for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy system installed on
59 the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate electricity
60 and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
61 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of
62 certain requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-
63 generator. Section 28 of this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public
64 Utilities Commission of Nevada relating to net metering tariffs and standard net
65 metering contracts to set forth procedures and requirements concerning the process
66 for applying for and installing a net metering system, which must include: (1)
67 reasonable and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) the requirement for a
68 utility that denies the application of a net metering applicant to provide to the net
69 metering applicant a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
70 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and
71 quality standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards,
-
*SB440_R2*
– 3 –
72 prohibits a utility from requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional
73 standards or requirements or take certain other actions solely because of his or her
74 status as a customer-generator. (NRS 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally
75 requires a customer-generator to obtain all necessary permits and approvals
76 required by any governmental entity for the installation of his or her net metering
77 system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits and
78 approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various
79 additional requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and
80 the net metering system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing
81 law.

SECOND REPRINT S.B. 440
SENATE BILL NO. 440–COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to electricity.
(BDR 10-950)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to electricity; establishing a process by which a
unit’s owner in certain unit-owners’ associations may
submit a request to install a distributed generation system;
establishing certain powers and duties of certain unit-
owners’ associations with respect to the installation of
distributed generation systems; establishing and revising
certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for
the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system
and a power purchase agreement; imposing certain
requirements upon a solar installation company; revising
provisions relating to net metering systems; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
2 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
3 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
4 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
5 598.9822) Sections 14.1-14.3 and 14.5 of this bill define certain terms for the
6 purposes of these provisions governing such agreements. Section 14.4 of this bill
7 makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host customer for a certain
8 period if the solar installation company that is a party to the agreement does not
9 hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the monetary limit of
10 that license. Section 21.5 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the
11 provisions of sections 14.1-14.4 are enforced in the same manner as other
12 provisions governing solar installation companies and distributed generation
13 systems.
14 Sections 15-20 of this bill require an agreement for the lease or purchase of a
15 distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover page for
16 such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation
-
*SB440_R2*

– 2 –
17 company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the distributed
18 generation system; and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on lessees,
19 purchasers and host customers.
20 Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of
21 certain communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than
22 4 years after the final inspection of the distributed generation system of the
23 purchaser, lessee or host customer. (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 of this bill
24 requires the solar installation company to provide a copy of that recording within
25 10 business days after receipt of a request from the purchaser, lessee, host
26 customer, distributed generation system financier, Attorney General, Division of
27 Financial Institutions of the Department of Business and Industry, State
28 Contractors’ Board, Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
29 or a law enforcement agency. If the solar installation company fails to do so, the
30 lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
31 purchaser, lessee or host customer. Section 21 also requires a solar installation
32 company to submit proof to the purchaser, lessee or host customer that the solar
33 installation company is properly licensed before the commencement of the
34 installation of a distributed generation system.
35 Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or
36 conditions contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit
37 or unreasonably restrict an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining
38 solar energy on his or her property. (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13.3 of this
39 bill sets forth a process by which a unit’s owner in a unit-owners’ association
40 whose governing documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on
41 architectural improvements may submit a request to install a distributed generation
42 system. Section 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed
43 generation system unless the association approves the request.
44 Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents
45 authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to
46 adopt rules and regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation
47 system and sets forth the required and authorized contents of such rules and
48 regulations. Under section 13.3, if such an association has not adopted such rules
49 and regulations, the association is prohibited from denying the request of a unit’s
50 owner to install a distributed generation system or imposing conditions upon the
51 installation. Section 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association
52 with respect to certain accessories for a distributed generation system.
53 Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is
54 defined under existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the
55 electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a
56 customer-generator that is fed back to the utility; and (2) a net metering system,
57 which is defined under existing law to mean, in general, certain facilities or systems
58 for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy system installed on
59 the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate electricity
60 and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
61 bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of
62 certain requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-
63 generator. Section 28 of this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public
64 Utilities Commission of Nevada relating to net metering tariffs and standard net
65 metering contracts to set forth procedures and requirements concerning the process
66 for applying for and installing a net metering system, which must include: (1)
67 reasonable and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) the requirement for a
68 utility that denies the application of a net metering applicant to provide to the net
69 metering applicant a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
70 Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and
71 quality standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards,
-
*SB440_R2*

– 3 –
72 prohibits a utility from requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional
73 standards or requirements or take certain other actions solely because of his or her
74 status as a customer-generator. (NRS 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally
75 requires a customer-generator to obtain all necessary permits and approvals
76 required by any governmental entity for the installation of his or her net metering
77 system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits and
78 approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various
79 additional requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and
80 the net metering system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing
81 law.
