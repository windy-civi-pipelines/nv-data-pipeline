Senate Bill No. 440–Committee on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to electricity; establishing a process by which a
unit’s owner in certain unit-owners’ associations may submit
a request to install a distributed generation system;
establishing certain powers and duties of certain unit-owners’
associations with respect to the installation of distributed
generation systems; establishing and revising certain
requirements for the contents of an agreement for the
purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a
power purchase agreement; imposing certain requirements
upon a solar installation company; revising provisions
relating to net metering systems; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
598.9822) Sections 14.1-14.3 and 14.5 of this bill define certain terms for the
purposes of these provisions governing such agreements. Section 14.4 of this bill
makes a power purchase agreement voidable by the host customer for a certain
period if the solar installation company that is a party to the agreement does not
hold the proper contractor’s license or is not acting within the monetary limit of
that license. Section 21.5 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the
provisions of sections 14.1-14.4 are enforced in the same manner as other
provisions governing solar installation companies and distributed generation
systems.
Sections 15-20 of this bill require an agreement for the lease or purchase of a
distributed generation system, a power purchase agreement and the cover page for
such agreements to: (1) contain certain disclosures concerning the solar installation
company; (2) provide certain information about the parts of the distributed
generation system; and (3) impose certain duties and liabilities on lessees,
purchasers and host customers.
Existing law requires a solar installation company to maintain a recording of
certain communications with a purchaser, lessee or host customer for not less than
4 years after the final inspection of the distributed generation system of the
purchaser, lessee or host customer. (NRS 598.98213) Section 21 of this bill
requires the solar installation company to provide a copy of that recording within
10 business days after receipt of a request from the purchaser, lessee, host
customer, distributed generation system financier, Attorney General, Division of
Financial Institutions of the Department of Business and Industry, State
Contractors’ Board, Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
or a law enforcement agency. If the solar installation company fails to do so, the
lease or purchase agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
purchaser, lessee or host customer. Section 21 also requires a solar installation
company to submit proof to the purchaser, lessee or host customer that the solar
installation company is properly licensed before the commencement of the
installation of a distributed generation system.

Existing law sets forth a prohibition against covenants, restrictions or
conditions contained in deeds, contracts or other legal instruments which prohibit
or unreasonably restrict an owner of a property from using a system for obtaining
solar energy on his or her property. (NRS 111.239, 278.0208) Section 13.3 of this
bill sets forth a process by which a unit’s owner in a unit-owners’ association
whose governing documents authorize the association to impose restrictions on
architectural improvements may submit a request to install a distributed generation
system. Section 13.3 prohibits such a unit’s owner from installing a distributed
generation system unless the association approves the request.
Section 13.7 of this bill authorizes an association whose governing documents
authorize the association to impose restrictions on architectural improvements to
adopt rules and regulations concerning the installation of a distributed generation
system and sets forth the required and authorized contents of such rules and
regulations. Under section 13.3, if such an association has not adopted such rules
and regulations, the association is prohibited from denying the request of a unit’s
owner to install a distributed generation system or imposing conditions upon the
installation. Section 13.7 additionally prohibits certain activities of an association
with respect to certain accessories for a distributed generation system.
Existing law sets forth various requirements for: (1) net metering, which is
defined under existing law to mean the measure of the difference between the
electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a
customer-generator that is fed back to the utility; and (2) a net metering system,
which is defined under existing law to mean, in general, certain facilities or systems
for the generation of electricity, including a facility or energy system installed on
the premises of a customer-generator that uses solar energy to generate electricity
and meets certain other requirements. (NRS 704.766-704.776) Section 25 of this
bill imposes certain timing requirements upon a public utility for the carrying out of
certain requests relating to a net metering system submitted by a customer-
generator. Section 28 of this bill requires the regulations adopted by the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada relating to net metering tariffs and standard net
metering contracts to set forth procedures and requirements concerning the process
for applying for and installing a net metering system, which must include: (1)
reasonable and appropriate timelines for the process; and (2) the requirement for a
utility that denies the application of a net metering applicant to provide to the net
metering applicant a notice detailing the reasons for the denial.
Existing law: (1) requires a net metering system to meet certain safety and
quality standards; and (2) if the net metering system meets those standards,
prohibits a utility from requiring the customer-generator to comply with additional
standards or requirements or take certain other actions solely because of his or her
status as a customer-generator. (NRS 704.774) Section 29 of this bill additionally
requires a customer-generator to obtain all necessary permits and approvals
required by any governmental entity for the installation of his or her net metering
system and install the net metering system in compliance with the permits and
approvals. Under section 29, a utility is prohibited from imposing various
additional requirements if the customer-generator satisfies such requirements and
the net metering system complies with the safety standards set forth under existing
law.
