Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a landlord and a tenant to perform certain obligations
2 with respect to a lease of real property. (NRS 118A.240-118A.300) As part of a
3 lease of real property, a landlord may require a tenant to pay a security deposit,
4 defined as a payment, deposit, fee or charge used by the landlord to: (1) remedy a
5 default in the payment of rent by the tenant; (2) repair damage to the premises other
6 than normal wear; and (3) clean the dwelling unit. (NRS 118A.240, 118A.242)
7 Section 5 of this bill defines the term “security deposit” to mean a deposit made in
8 cash or by any other acceptable manner to a landlord for any of the following
9 purposes: (1) remedying any default of the tenant in the payment of periodic rent,
10 including, without limitation, the cost of any fee for the late payment of rent; (2)
11 repairing damage to the premises caused by the tenant other than normal wear; and
12 (3) cleaning the unit. Section 28 of this bill repeals the existing definition of
13 “security deposit.”
14 Existing law requires a landlord to return a security deposit, or any remaining
15 portion thereof, within 30 days after the termination of the tenancy and makes the
16 landlord liable for certain amounts for failing to return the security deposit within
17 this period. (NRS 118A.242) Section 15 of this bill: (1) requires a landlord to
18 deliver an itemized, written accounting of the disposition of the security deposit or
19 surety bond, or a combination thereof in certain circumstances; (2) prescribes how
20 delivery of the itemized, written accounting must be effectuated by the landlord;
21 and (3) makes the landlord liable for certain amounts for failing to deliver the
22 itemized, written accounting. Section 15 also provides that in any action relating to
23 an amount claimed of a security deposit for repairing damage to the premises
24 caused by the tenant, the landlord has the burden of proving: (1) that the damage to
25 the premises occurred during the tenancy; and (2) the actual costs of repair.
26 Existing law defines “normal wear” as deterioration which occurs without
27 negligence, carelessness or abuse of the premises, equipment or chattels by the
28 tenant, a member of the household of the tenant or another person on the premises
29 with the consent of the tenant. (NRS 118A.110) Section 11 of this bill revises the
30 definition of “normal wear” to mean expected deterioration which occurs during the
31 course of a tenancy from the normal use of the premises by such persons.
32 Existing law requires written rental agreements to contain certain provisions,
33 including, without limitation, provisions concerning: (1) the amount of rent and the
34 manner and time of its payment; and (2) fees which are required and the purposes
35 for which they are required. (NRS 118A.200) Existing law authorizes a landlord to
36 charge a reasonable fee for the late payment of rent. (NRS 118A.210) Section 12 of
37 this bill requires such rental agreements to include a grace period for the late
38 payment of rent. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a landlord from charging the fee
39 for the late payment of rent until the expiration of the grace period set forth in the
40 rental agreement. Section 4 of this bill defines the term “grace period” for such
41 purposes. Section 12 also: (1) requires a written rental agreement to include a
42 separate appendix that contains an explanation of each fee that may be charged
43 during the term of the rental agreement and the purpose for which the fee may be
44 charged; and (2) makes it unlawful for a landlord or other person authorized to
45 enter into a rental agreement on his or her behalf to charge a tenant a fee in an
46 amount or for any purpose that is not set forth in the appendix. Finally, section 12
47 requires a written rental agreement to also include a separate appendix that contains
48 an explanation of the rights of the tenant pursuant to federal and state law and local
49 ordinances.
50 Existing law places certain prohibitions on rental agreements. (NRS 118A.220)
51 Section 14 of this bill prohibits rental agreements from requiring tenants to pay any
52 fee, fine or cost except those which are: (1) authorized by statute; or (2) actual and
53 reasonable. Sections 12, 19-21 and 24 of this bill make conforming changes
54 relating to the limitations on fees, fines and costs.

55 Section 7 of this bill authorizes a landlord to charge a fee for the eviction of a
56 tenant. Section 6 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective
57 tenant any fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1)
58 rents the dwelling unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct
59 the activity for which the fee was collected. Section 6 further prohibits a landlord
60 from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a
61 background check for a minor who is a member of the household of the prospective
62 tenant.
63 Section 8 of this bill prohibits a landlord from transferring, selling, assigning or
64 reporting to certain agencies any amount owed by the tenant, unless the landlord
65 first delivers to the tenant an itemized, written accounting of all outstanding
66 amounts owed by the tenant. Section 8.5 of this bill requires any action for the
67 enforcement of any provision of a rental agreement to be brought: (1) not later than
68 2 years after the termination of the tenancy; and (2) as a small claims action, if
69 certain jurisdictional limits apply to the amount owed by the tenant.
70 Section 9 of this bill provides that if a landlord changes his or her agent, broker
71 or property management company, the landlord or the new agent, broker or
72 company is required to send certain information to the tenant within 10 business
73 days after the change.
74 Existing law prohibits a landlord from increasing the rent of a tenant unless the
75 tenant is served with advance notice of the increase. (NRS 118A.300) Section 18 of
76 this bill similarly prohibits a landlord from increasing certain fees, fines and costs
77 charged to the tenant unless the tenant is served with advance notice of the increase.
78 Existing law provides that if a tenant’s failure to perform basic obligations can
79 be remedied by cleaning and the tenant fails to comply with a request to remedy
80 such failure in a timely manner, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit, cause the
81 work to be done and bill the tenant. (NRS 118A.440) Section 22 of this bill deletes
82 this provision of existing law.
83 Existing law requires a tenant to be served with certain notices relating to
84 evictions. Existing law also provides that certain notices may be served by an agent
85 of an attorney who is licensed in this State if: (1) the attorney has been retained by
86 the landlord in certain actions; and (2) the agent is acting at the direction and under
87 the direct supervision of the attorney. (NRS 40.280) In addition to the existing
88 requirements concerning such agents, section 25 of this bill prohibits the agent
89 from being employed as a property manager in this State.
90 Existing law authorizes a nongovernmental legal or commercial entity to be
91 represented by its director, officer or employee in an action in small claims court.
92 (NRS 73.012) Similarly, section 26 of this bill authorizes a landlord to be
93 represented by his or her agent in a small claims action.
94 Section 26.5 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of this bill do
95 not apply to a tenant of a dwelling unit that is a manufactured home, or on the
96 premises of a manufactured home lot or a manufactured home park.
97 Finally, section 27 of this bill provides that a rental agreement entered into
98 before the effective date of this bill is binding upon the parties and may be enforced
99 on or after that date, regardless of whether the provisions of the rental agreement
100 conflict with the amendatory provisions of this bill.

4 stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
5 of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
6 provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by

11 which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
12 are located or to the district court of the county in which the

36 the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
37 or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
38 nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.

41 affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
42 subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
43 hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
44 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
45 provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
-
*SB78_R2*
– 18 –
1 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
2 guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
3 for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
4 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
5 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
6 refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
7 provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
8 proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
9 inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
10 tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
11 other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
12 unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
13 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
14 thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
15 accordance with NRS 40.251.
16 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
17 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the

28  whichever is later.
29 8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
30 court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
31 held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
32 affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
33 upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
34 At the hearing, the court may:
35 (a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
36 to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
37 (b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
38 of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
39 to be due.

42 court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
43 reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
44 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
45 tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
-
*SB78_R2*
– 19 –
1 filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
2 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
3 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
4 the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
5 by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
6 court may:

8 essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
9 necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
10 (b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
11 10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
12 awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall
13 consider:

15 (b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant;
16 and
17 (c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s
18 conduct.
19 11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that
20 is submitted after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or
21 had served a notice pursuant to subsection 1 if the refusal is based
22 on the fact that the tenant has not paid collection fees, attorney’s
23 fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable [charge] fee for late
24 [payments] payment of rent [or dishonored checks,] or a security
25 deposit. As used in this subsection, “security deposit” has the
26 meaning ascribed to it in [NRS 118A.240.] section 5 of this act.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a landlord and a tenant to perform certain obligations
2 with respect to a lease of real property. (NRS 118A.240-118A.300) As part of a
3 lease of real property, a landlord may require a tenant to pay a security deposit,
4 defined as a payment, deposit, fee or charge used by the landlord to: (1) remedy a
5 default in the payment of rent by the tenant; (2) repair damage to the premises other
6 than normal wear; and (3) clean the dwelling unit. (NRS 118A.240, 118A.242)
7 Section 5 of this bill defines the term “security deposit” to mean a deposit made in
8 cash or by any other acceptable manner to a landlord for any of the following
9 purposes: (1) remedying any default of the tenant in the payment of periodic rent,
10 including, without limitation, the cost of any fee for the late payment of rent; (2)
11 repairing damage to the premises caused by the tenant other than normal wear; and
12 (3) cleaning the unit. Section 28 of this bill repeals the existing definition of
13 “security deposit.”
14 Existing law requires a landlord to return a security deposit, or any remaining
15 portion thereof, within 30 days after the termination of the tenancy and makes the
16 landlord liable for certain amounts for failing to return the security deposit within
17 this period. (NRS 118A.242) Section 15 of this bill: (1) requires a landlord to
18 deliver an itemized, written accounting of the disposition of the security deposit or
19 surety bond, or a combination thereof in certain circumstances; (2) prescribes how
20 delivery of the itemized, written accounting must be effectuated by the landlord;
21 and (3) makes the landlord liable for certain amounts for failing to deliver the
22 itemized, written accounting. Section 15 also provides that in any action relating to
23 an amount claimed of a security deposit for repairing damage to the premises
24 caused by the tenant, the landlord has the burden of proving: (1) that the damage to
25 the premises occurred during the tenancy; and (2) the actual costs of repair.
26 Existing law defines “normal wear” as deterioration which occurs without
27 negligence, carelessness or abuse of the premises, equipment or chattels by the
28 tenant, a member of the household of the tenant or another person on the premises
29 with the consent of the tenant. (NRS 118A.110) Section 11 of this bill revises the
30 definition of “normal wear” to mean expected deterioration which occurs during the
31 course of a tenancy from the normal use of the premises by such persons.
32 Existing law requires written rental agreements to contain certain provisions,
33 including, without limitation, provisions concerning: (1) the amount of rent and the
34 manner and time of its payment; and (2) fees which are required and the purposes
35 for which they are required. (NRS 118A.200) Existing law authorizes a landlord to
36 charge a reasonable fee for the late payment of rent. (NRS 118A.210) Section 12 of
37 this bill requires such rental agreements to include a grace period for the late
38 payment of rent. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a landlord from charging the fee
39 for the late payment of rent until the expiration of the grace period set forth in the
40 rental agreement. Section 4 of this bill defines the term “grace period” for such
41 purposes. Section 12 also: (1) requires a written rental agreement to include a
42 separate appendix that contains an explanation of each fee that may be charged
43 during the term of the rental agreement and the purpose for which the fee may be
44 charged; and (2) makes it unlawful for a landlord or other person authorized to
45 enter into a rental agreement on his or her behalf to charge a tenant a fee in an
46 amount or for any purpose that is not set forth in the appendix. Finally, section 12
47 requires a written rental agreement to also include a separate appendix that contains
48 an explanation of the rights of the tenant pursuant to federal and state law and local
49 ordinances.
50 Existing law places certain prohibitions on rental agreements. (NRS 118A.220)
51 Section 14 of this bill prohibits rental agreements from requiring tenants to pay any
52 fee, fine or cost except those which are: (1) authorized by statute; or (2) actual and
53 reasonable. Sections 12, 19-21 and 24 of this bill make conforming changes
54 relating to the limitations on fees, fines and costs.

*SB78_R2*

– 3 –
55 Section 7 of this bill authorizes a landlord to charge a fee for the eviction of a
56 tenant. Section 6 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective
57 tenant any fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1)
58 rents the dwelling unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct
59 the activity for which the fee was collected. Section 6 further prohibits a landlord
60 from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a
61 background check for a minor who is a member of the household of the prospective
62 tenant.
63 Section 8 of this bill prohibits a landlord from transferring, selling, assigning or
64 reporting to certain agencies any amount owed by the tenant, unless the landlord
65 first delivers to the tenant an itemized, written accounting of all outstanding
66 amounts owed by the tenant. Section 8.5 of this bill requires any action for the
67 enforcement of any provision of a rental agreement to be brought: (1) not later than
68 2 years after the termination of the tenancy; and (2) as a small claims action, if
69 certain jurisdictional limits apply to the amount owed by the tenant.
70 Section 9 of this bill provides that if a landlord changes his or her agent, broker
71 or property management company, the landlord or the new agent, broker or
72 company is required to send certain information to the tenant within 10 business
73 days after the change.
74 Existing law prohibits a landlord from increasing the rent of a tenant unless the
75 tenant is served with advance notice of the increase. (NRS 118A.300) Section 18 of
76 this bill similarly prohibits a landlord from increasing certain fees, fines and costs
77 charged to the tenant unless the tenant is served with advance notice of the increase.
78 Existing law provides that if a tenant’s failure to perform basic obligations can
79 be remedied by cleaning and the tenant fails to comply with a request to remedy
80 such failure in a timely manner, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit, cause the
81 work to be done and bill the tenant. (NRS 118A.440) Section 22 of this bill deletes
82 this provision of existing law.
83 Existing law requires a tenant to be served with certain notices relating to
84 evictions. Existing law also provides that certain notices may be served by an agent
85 of an attorney who is licensed in this State if: (1) the attorney has been retained by
86 the landlord in certain actions; and (2) the agent is acting at the direction and under
87 the direct supervision of the attorney. (NRS 40.280) In addition to the existing
88 requirements concerning such agents, section 25 of this bill prohibits the agent
89 from being employed as a property manager in this State.
90 Existing law authorizes a nongovernmental legal or commercial entity to be
91 represented by its director, officer or employee in an action in small claims court.
92 (NRS 73.012) Similarly, section 26 of this bill authorizes a landlord to be
93 represented by his or her agent in a small claims action.
94 Section 26.5 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of this bill do
95 not apply to a tenant of a dwelling unit that is a manufactured home, or on the
96 premises of a manufactured home lot or a manufactured home park.
97 Finally, section 27 of this bill provides that a rental agreement entered into
98 before the effective date of this bill is binding upon the parties and may be enforced
99 on or after that date, regardless of whether the provisions of the rental agreement
100 conflict with the amendatory provisions of this bill.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 118.101 is hereby amended to read as follows:

27 fully abates during this period. The tenant may recover the actual
28 and reasonable cost of that other housing which is in excess of the
29 amount of rent which is abated.
30 2. If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not
31 proceed under NRS 118A.350 and 118A.360 as to that breach.
32 3. The rights of the tenant under this section do not arise until
33 the tenant has given written notice as required by subsection 1,
34 except that the tenant may, without having given that notice:
35 (a) Recover damages as authorized under paragraph (b) of
36 subsection 1 if the landlord:
37 (1) Admits to the court that the landlord had knowledge of
38 the lack of such essential items or services; or
39 (2) Has received written notice of the uninhabitable
40 condition caused by such a lack from a governmental agency

3 violations of building, housing or health codes; and
4 (2) Fails to remedy or attempt in good faith to remedy the
5 breach within the time prescribed in the written notice of that
6 condition from the governmental agency.
7 4. The rights of the tenant under paragraph (c) of subsection 1
8 do not arise unless the tenant is current in the payment of rent at the
9 time of giving written notice pursuant to subsection 1.
10 5. If such a condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent
11 act or omission of the tenant, a member of his or her household or
12 other person on the premises with his or her consent, the tenant has
13 no rights under this section.
14 Sec. 22. NRS 118A.440 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 118A.440 If the tenant’s failure to perform basic obligations
16 under this chapter can be remedied by repair [,] or replacement of a
17 damaged item , [or cleaning,] and the tenant fails to use his or her
18 best efforts to comply within 14 days after written notice by the
19 landlord specifying the breach and requesting that the tenant remedy
20 it within that period of time or more promptly if conditions require
21 in case of emergency, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit and
22 cause the work to be done in a workmanlike manner and submit the
23 itemized bill for the actual and reasonable cost, or the fair and
24 reasonable value of the work. The itemized bill must be paid as rent
25 on the next date periodic rent is due, or if the rental agreement has
26 terminated, may be submitted to the tenant for immediate payment
27 or deducted from the security deposit.
28 Sec. 23. (Deleted by amendment.)
29 Sec. 24. NRS 40.253 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 40.253 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in
31 addition to the remedy provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to
32 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment,
33 mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by
34 the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent,
35 the landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice
36 in writing, requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the
37 surrender of the premises:
38 (a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
39 following the day of service; or
40 (b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
41 in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
42 less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or
43 before noon of the fourth full day following the day of service.
44  As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the
45 landlord or the landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the
-
*SB78_R2*

– 16 –
1 tenant. If personal service was not so delivered, the “day of service”
2 means the day the notice is delivered, after posting and mailing
3 pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service if the
4 request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by
5 the sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall
6 be deemed to be the day next following the day that the request is
7 made for service by the sheriff or constable.
8 2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a
9 tenant pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 shall attempt to
10 deliver the notice in person in the manner set forth in subsection 2 of
11 NRS 40.2542. If the notice cannot be delivered in person, the
12 landlord or the landlord’s agent:
13 (a) Shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the
14 premises and mail the notice by overnight mail; and
15 (b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the
16 notice to the sheriff or constable for service in the manner set forth
17 in subsection 1 of NRS 40.280. The sheriff or constable shall not
18 accept the notice for service unless it is accompanied by written
19 evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took possession of
20 the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
21 tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
22 procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
23 acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
24 hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the
25 landlord’s agent.
26 3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
27 (a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
28 (b) Advise the tenant:
29 (1) Of the tenant’s right to contest the matter by filing, within
30 the time specified in subsection 1 for the payment of the rent or
31 surrender of the premises, an affidavit with the court that has
32 jurisdiction over the matter stating that the tenant has tendered
33 payment or is not in default in the payment of the rent;
34 (2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an
35 unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal
36 of the tenant or an order providing for the nonadmittance of the
37 tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the
38 order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24 hours
39 after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or
40 constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not
41 later than 36 hours after the posting of the order; and
42 (3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief
43 if a landlord unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or
44 excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s
45 entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or causes or permits
-
*SB78_R2*

– 17 –
1 the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
2 agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
3 4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
4 stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
5 of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
6 provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
7 locking or otherwise.
8 5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
9 (a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
10 of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
11 which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
12 are located or to the district court of the county in which the
13 dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are
14 located, whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may
15 thereupon issue an order directing the sheriff or constable of the
16 county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not
17 later than 24 hours after the order is received by the sheriff or
18 constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not
19 earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of
20 the order. The affidavit must state or contain:
21 (1) The date the tenancy commenced.
22 (2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
23 (3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits
24 paid in advance, in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
25 (4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
26 (5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession
27 without paying rent.
28 (6) The amount of rent claimed due and delinquent.
29 (7) A statement that the written notice was served on the

31 (8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.

33 (b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit
34 described in subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been
35 received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
36 the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
37 or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
38 nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
39 6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
40 subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
41 affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
42 subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
43 hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
44 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
45 provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
-
*SB78_R2*

– 18 –
1 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
2 guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
3 for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
4 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
5 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
6 refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
7 provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
8 proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
9 inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
10 tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
11 other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
12 unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
13 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
14 thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
15 accordance with NRS 40.251.
16 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
17 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
18 court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the
19 amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
20 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
21 property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20
22 days after the summary order for removal of the tenant or the
23 abandonment of the premises by the tenant, or within 20 days after:
24 (a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises;
25 and
26 (b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided
27 to the tenant,
28  whichever is later.
29 8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
30 court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
31 held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
32 affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
33 upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
34 At the hearing, the court may:
35 (a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
36 to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
37 (b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
38 of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
39 to be due.
40 9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
41 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
42 court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
43 reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
44 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
45 tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
-
*SB78_R2*

– 19 –
1 filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
2 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
3 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
4 the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
5 by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
6 court may:
7 (a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s
8 essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
9 necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
10 (b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
11 10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
12 awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall
13 consider:
14 (a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
15 (b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant;
16 and
17 (c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s
18 conduct.
19 11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that
20 is submitted after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or
21 had served a notice pursuant to subsection 1 if the refusal is based
22 on the fact that the tenant has not paid collection fees, attorney’s
23 fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable [charge] fee for late
24 [payments] payment of rent [or dishonored checks,] or a security
25 deposit. As used in this subsection, “security deposit” has the
26 meaning ascribed to it in [NRS 118A.240.] section 5 of this act.
27 12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this
28 section does not apply to:
29 (a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to
30 the tenant of a recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home

38 of business of the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.
39 Sec. 25. NRS 40.280 is hereby amended to read as follows:
40 40.280 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.253 and
41 40.2542, the notices required by NRS 40.251 to 40.260, inclusive,

27 the real property, by posting a copy in a conspicuous place on the
28 property and mailing a copy to the unlawful or unauthorized
