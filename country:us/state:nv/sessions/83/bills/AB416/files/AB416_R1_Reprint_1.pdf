EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the board of trustees of a
school district, the governing body of a charter school, a
school employee or a volunteer and certain persons
affiliated with a public library from limiting access to
library materials under certain circumstances; authorizing
the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to adopt
a policy containing such a prohibition; prohibiting certain
actions against certain persons which are intended to limit
access to library materials; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a district attorney or city attorney to file a complaint in
2 the district court to have an item or material declared obscene and to enjoin owner
3 and possessor of the item or material from selling, renting, exhibiting, reproducing,
4 manufacturing or distributing it. (NRS 201.241) For these purposes, “obscenity” is
5 defined in existing law as any item, material or performance which: (1) an average
6 person applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole,
7 appeals to prurient interest; (2) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary artistic,
8 political or scientific value; and (3) depicts or describes in a patently offensive way
9 certain sexual acts, excretory functions, sadism or masochism or lewdly exhibits the
10 genitals. (NRS 201.235) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the board of trustees of
11 a school district, the governing body of a charter school, a school employee or a
12 volunteer from taking certain actions which limit the access of pupils to library
13 materials of a school library; and (2) sets forth certain circumstances in which
14 access to library materials may be restricted for reasons unrelated to the content of
15 such materials. Section 2 additionally authorizes a person who meets certain
16 requirements and who objects to the inclusion of any library material in the
17 collection of a school library to petition a court for the removal of the material and
-
*AB416_R1*

– 2 –
18 authorizes a court to order the removal of such material if the court determines that
19 the material is obscene, based on a definition of obscenity which is substantially
20 similar to the definition of obscenity in existing law. Section 3.7 of this bill creates
21 similar provisions governing access to materials in a public library.
22 The Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
23 establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose
24 duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 3.2 of this bill
25 authorizes the Board of Regents to adopt a policy that prohibits an institution within
26 the Nevada System of Higher Education or an employee of such an institution from
27 limiting the access of students and employees to any library materials of a library at
28 such an institution. Section 3.2 additionally provides requirements that are similar
29 to those set forth in section 2 with which such a policy must comply.
30 Section 3 of this bill makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for
31 any person to use or threaten or attempt to use any force, intimidation, coercion,
32 violence, restraint or undue influence with the intent to: (1) prevent a pupil from
33 using or accessing library materials; or (2) induce or compel the board of trustees of
34 a school district, the governing body of a charter school, a school employee or a
35 volunteer to violate the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further makes it a crime,
36 punishable as a category E felony, for any person to disseminate any personal
37 identifying information or sensitive information of a member of the board of
38 trustees of a school district, a member of the governing body of a charter school, a
39 school employee, a volunteer or a pupil without consent, knowing that the member,
40 employee, volunteer or pupil could be identified by such information, if: (1) the
41 person disseminates such personal identifying information or sensitive information
42 in retaliation for the victim accessing or allowing a pupil to access library materials
43 from a school library with the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or
44 promote any criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death,
45 bodily injury or stalking or with the intent to cause harm to the member, school
46 employee, volunteer or pupil and with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the
47 reasonable likelihood that the dissemination of the information may cause death,
48 bodily injury or stalking; and (2) the dissemination of the personal identifying
49 information or sensitive information would cause a reasonable person to fear the
50 death, bodily injury or stalking of himself or herself or a close relation or causes the
51 death, bodily injury or stalking of the victim whose information was disseminated
52 or a close relation of the victim. Sections 3.3 and 3.8 of this bill create similar
53 protections for a member of the Board of Regents, an employee of an institution
54 within the System or a student and a member of a governing body of a public
55 library or a library employee, respectively.
