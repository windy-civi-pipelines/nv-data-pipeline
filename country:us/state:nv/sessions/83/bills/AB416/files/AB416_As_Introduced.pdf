EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the board of trustees of a
school district, the governing body of a charter school or a
school employee from limiting access to library materials
by pupils under certain circumstances; prohibiting certain
actions against the members of the board of trustees of a
school district, the members of the governing body of a
charter school, school employees, pupils and certain other
persons which are intended to limit access to library
materials by pupils; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a district attorney or city attorney to file a complaint in
2 the district court to have an item or material declared obscene and to enjoin owner
3 and possessor of the item or material from selling, renting, exhibiting, reproducing,
4 manufacturing or distributing it. (NRS 201.241) For these purposes, “obscenity” is
5 defined in existing law as any item, material or performance which: (1) an average
6 person applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole,
7 appeals to prurient interest; (2) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary artistic,
8 political or scientific value; and (3) depicts or describes in a patently offensive way
9 certain sexual acts, excretory functions, sadism or masochism or lewdly exhibits the
10 genitals. (NRS 201.235) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the board of trustees of
11 a school district, the governing body of a charter school or a school employee from
12 taking certain actions which limit the access of pupils to library materials of a
13 school library; and (2) sets forth certain circumstances in which access to library
14 materials may be restricted for reasons unrelated to the content of such materials.
15 Section 2 additionally authorizes a person who objects to the inclusion of any
16 library material in the collection of a school library to petition a court for the
17 removal of the material and authorizes a court to order the removal of such material

18 if the court determines that the material is obscene, based on a definition of
19 obscenity which is substantially similar to the definition of obscenity in existing
20 law.
21 Section 3 of this bill makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for
22 any person to use or threaten or attempt to use any force, intimidation, coercion,
23 violence, restraint or undue influence with the intent to: (1) prevent a pupil from
24 using or accessing library materials; or (2) induce or compel the board of trustees of
25 a school district, the governing body of a charter school or a school employee to
26 violate the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further makes it a crime, punishable
27 as a category E felony, for any person to disseminate any personal identifying
28 information or sensitive information of a member of the board of trustees of a
29 school district, a member of the governing body of a charter school, a school
30 employee or a pupil without consent, knowing that the member, employee or pupil
31 could be identified by such information, if: (1) the person disseminates such
32 personal identifying information or sensitive information in retaliation for the
33 victim accessing or allowing a pupil to access library materials from a school
34 library with the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or promote any
35 criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death, bodily injury or
36 stalking or with the intent to cause harm to the member, school employee or pupil
37 and with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the reasonable likelihood that the
38 dissemination of the information may cause death, bodily injury or stalking; and (2)
39 the dissemination of the personal identifying information or sensitive information
40 would cause a reasonable person to fear the death, bodily injury or stalking of
41 himself or herself or a close relation or causes the death, bodily injury or stalking of
42 the victim whose information was disseminated or a close relation of the victim.
