SUMMARY—Revises provisions concerning access to certain library materials .
[in public schools.] (BDR 34-925)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the board of trustees of a school district,
the governing body of a charter school , [or] a school employee or a
volunteer and certain persons affiliated with a public library from
limiting access to library materials [by pupils] under certain
circumstances; authorizing the Board of Regents of the University
of Nevada to adopt a policy containing such a prohibition;
prohibiting certain actions against [the members of the board of
trustees of a school district, the members of the governing body of a
charter school, school employees, pupils and] certain [other] persons
which are intended to limit access to library materials ; [by pupils;]
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a district attorney or city attorney to file a complaint in the district
2 court to have an item or material declared obscene and to enjoin owner and possessor of the
3 item or material from selling, renting, exhibiting, reproducing, manufacturing or distributing
4 it. (NRS 201.241) For these purposes, “obscenity” is defined in existing law as any item,
5 material or performance which: (1) an average person applying contemporary community
6 standards would find, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest; (2) taken as a whole, lacks
7 serious literary artistic, political or scientific value; and (3) depicts or describes in a patently
8 offensive way certain sexual acts, excretory functions, sadism or masochism or lewdly
9 exhibits the genitals. (NRS 201.235) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the board of trustees
10 of a school district, the governing body of a charter school , [or] a school employee or a
11 volunteer from taking certain actions which limit the access of pupils to library materials of a
12 school library; and (2) sets forth certain circumstances in which access to library materials
13 may be restricted for reasons unrelated to the content of such materials. Section 2 additionally
14 authorizes a person who meets certain requirements and who objects to the inclusion of any
15 library material in the collection of a school library to petition a court for the removal of the
16 material and authorizes a court to order the removal of such material if the court determines
17 that the material is obscene, based on a definition of obscenity which is substantially similar to
18 the definition of obscenity in existing law. Section 3.7 of this bill creates similar provisions
19 governing access to materials in a public library.
Assembly Amendment No. 404 to Assembly Bill No. 416 Page 4
20 The Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
21 establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose duties
22 are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 3.2 of this bill authorizes the
23 Board of Regents to adopt a policy that prohibits an institution within the Nevada
24 System of Higher Education or an employee of such an institution from limiting the
25 access of students and employees to any library materials of a library at such an
26 institution. Section 3.2 additionally provides requirements that are similar to those set
27 forth in section 2 with which such a policy must comply.
28 Section 3 of this bill makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for any person
29 to use or threaten or attempt to use any force, intimidation, coercion, violence, restraint or
30 undue influence with the intent to: (1) prevent a pupil from using or accessing library
31 materials; or (2) induce or compel the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
32 body of a charter school , [or] a school employee or a volunteer to violate the provisions of
33 section 2. Section 3 further makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for any
34 person to disseminate any personal identifying information or sensitive information of a
35 member of the board of trustees of a school district, a member of the governing body of a
36 charter school, a school employee , a volunteer or a pupil without consent, knowing that the
37 member, employee , volunteer or pupil could be identified by such information, if: (1) the
38 person disseminates such personal identifying information or sensitive information in
39 retaliation for the victim accessing or allowing a pupil to access library materials from a
40 school library with the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or promote any
41 criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death, bodily injury or stalking or
42 with the intent to cause harm to the member, school employee , volunteer or pupil and with
43 knowledge of or reckless disregard for the reasonable likelihood that the dissemination of the
44 information may cause death, bodily injury or stalking; and (2) the dissemination of the
45 personal identifying information or sensitive information would cause a reasonable person to
46 fear the death, bodily injury or stalking of himself or herself or a close relation or causes the
47 death, bodily injury or stalking of the victim whose information was disseminated or a close
48 relation of the victim. Sections 3.3 and 3.8 of this bill create similar protections for a
49 member of the Board of Regents, an employee of an institution within the System or a
50 student and a member of a governing body of a public library or a library employee,
51 respectively.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions concerning access to certain library materials .
[in public schools.] (BDR 34-925)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the board of trustees of a school district,
the governing body of a charter school , [or] a school employee or a
volunteer and certain persons affiliated with a public library from
limiting access to library materials [by pupils] under certain
circumstances; authorizing the Board of Regents of the University
of Nevada to adopt a policy containing such a prohibition;
prohibiting certain actions against [the members of the board of
trustees of a school district, the members of the governing body of a
charter school, school employees, pupils and] certain [other] persons
which are intended to limit access to library materials ; [by pupils;]
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a district attorney or city attorney to file a complaint in the district
2 court to have an item or material declared obscene and to enjoin owner and possessor of the
3 item or material from selling, renting, exhibiting, reproducing, manufacturing or distributing
4 it. (NRS 201.241) For these purposes, “obscenity” is defined in existing law as any item,
5 material or performance which: (1) an average person applying contemporary community
6 standards would find, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest; (2) taken as a whole, lacks
7 serious literary artistic, political or scientific value; and (3) depicts or describes in a patently
8 offensive way certain sexual acts, excretory functions, sadism or masochism or lewdly
9 exhibits the genitals. (NRS 201.235) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the board of trustees
10 of a school district, the governing body of a charter school , [or] a school employee or a
11 volunteer from taking certain actions which limit the access of pupils to library materials of a
12 school library; and (2) sets forth certain circumstances in which access to library materials
13 may be restricted for reasons unrelated to the content of such materials. Section 2 additionally
14 authorizes a person who meets certain requirements and who objects to the inclusion of any
15 library material in the collection of a school library to petition a court for the removal of the
16 material and authorizes a court to order the removal of such material if the court determines
17 that the material is obscene, based on a definition of obscenity which is substantially similar to
18 the definition of obscenity in existing law. Section 3.7 of this bill creates similar provisions
19 governing access to materials in a public library.

Assembly Amendment No. 404 to Assembly Bill No. 416 Page 4
20 The Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
21 establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose duties
22 are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 3.2 of this bill authorizes the
23 Board of Regents to adopt a policy that prohibits an institution within the Nevada
24 System of Higher Education or an employee of such an institution from limiting the
25 access of students and employees to any library materials of a library at such an
26 institution. Section 3.2 additionally provides requirements that are similar to those set
27 forth in section 2 with which such a policy must comply.
28 Section 3 of this bill makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for any person
29 to use or threaten or attempt to use any force, intimidation, coercion, violence, restraint or
30 undue influence with the intent to: (1) prevent a pupil from using or accessing library
31 materials; or (2) induce or compel the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
32 body of a charter school , [or] a school employee or a volunteer to violate the provisions of
33 section 2. Section 3 further makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for any
34 person to disseminate any personal identifying information or sensitive information of a
35 member of the board of trustees of a school district, a member of the governing body of a
36 charter school, a school employee , a volunteer or a pupil without consent, knowing that the
37 member, employee , volunteer or pupil could be identified by such information, if: (1) the
38 person disseminates such personal identifying information or sensitive information in
39 retaliation for the victim accessing or allowing a pupil to access library materials from a
40 school library with the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or promote any
41 criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death, bodily injury or stalking or
42 with the intent to cause harm to the member, school employee , volunteer or pupil and with
43 knowledge of or reckless disregard for the reasonable likelihood that the dissemination of the
44 information may cause death, bodily injury or stalking; and (2) the dissemination of the
45 personal identifying information or sensitive information would cause a reasonable person to
46 fear the death, bodily injury or stalking of himself or herself or a close relation or causes the
47 death, bodily injury or stalking of the victim whose information was disseminated or a close
48 relation of the victim. Sections 3.3 and 3.8 of this bill create similar protections for a
49 member of the Board of Regents, an employee of an institution within the System or a
50 student and a member of a governing body of a public library or a library employee,
51 respectively.
