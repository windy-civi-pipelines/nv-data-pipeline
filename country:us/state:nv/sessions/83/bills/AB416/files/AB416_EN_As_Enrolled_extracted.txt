Section 1:
Anderson, Considine; González and Moore
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the board of trustees of a
school district, the governing body of a charter school, a
school employee or a volunteer and certain persons affiliated
with a public library from limiting access to library materials
under certain circumstances; authorizing the Board of
Regents of the University of Nevada to adopt a policy
containing such a prohibition; prohibiting certain actions
against certain persons which are intended to limit access to
library materials; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a district attorney or city attorney to file a complaint in
the district court to have an item or material declared obscene and to enjoin owner
and possessor of the item or material from selling, renting, exhibiting, reproducing,
manufacturing or distributing it. (NRS 201.241) For these purposes, “obscenity” is
defined in existing law as any item, material or performance which: (1) an average
person applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole,
appeals to prurient interest; (2) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary artistic,
political or scientific value; and (3) depicts or describes in a patently offensive way
certain sexual acts, excretory functions, sadism or masochism or lewdly exhibits the
genitals. (NRS 201.235) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the board of trustees of
a school district, the governing body of a charter school, a school employee or a
volunteer from taking certain actions which limit the access of pupils to library
materials of a school library; and (2) sets forth certain circumstances in which
access to library materials may be restricted for reasons unrelated to the content of
such materials. Section 2 additionally authorizes a person who meets certain
requirements and who objects to the inclusion of any library material in the
collection of a school library to petition a court for the removal of the material and
authorizes a court to order the removal of such material if the court determines that
the material is obscene, based on a definition of obscenity which is substantially
similar to the definition of obscenity in existing law. Section 3.7 of this bill creates
similar provisions governing access to materials in a public library.
The Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose
duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 3.2 of this bill
authorizes the Board of Regents to adopt a policy that prohibits an institution within
the Nevada System of Higher Education or an employee of such an institution from
limiting the access of students and employees to any library materials of a library at
such an institution. Section 3.2 additionally provides requirements that are similar
to those set forth in section 2 with which such a policy must comply.

Section 2:
Section 3 of this bill makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for
any person to use or threaten or attempt to use any force, intimidation, coercion,
violence, restraint or undue influence with the intent to: (1) prevent a pupil from
using or accessing library materials; or (2) induce or compel the board of trustees of
a school district, the governing body of a charter school, a school employee or a
volunteer to violate the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further makes it a crime,
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
punishable as a category E felony, for any person to disseminate any personal
identifying information or sensitive information of a member of the board of
trustees of a school district, a member of the governing body of a charter school, a
school employee, a volunteer or a pupil without consent, knowing that the member,
employee, volunteer or pupil could be identified by such information, if: (1) the
person disseminates such personal identifying information or sensitive information
in retaliation for the victim accessing or allowing a pupil to access library materials
from a school library with the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or
promote any criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death,
bodily injury or stalking or with the intent to cause harm to the member, school
employee, volunteer or pupil and with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the
reasonable likelihood that the dissemination of the information may cause death,
bodily injury or stalking; and (2) the dissemination of the personal identifying
information or sensitive information would cause a reasonable person to fear the
death, bodily injury or stalking of himself or herself or a close relation or causes the
death, bodily injury or stalking of the victim whose information was disseminated
or a close relation of the victim. Sections 3.3 and 3.8 of this bill create similar
protections for a member of the Board of Regents, an employee of an institution
within the System or a student and a member of a governing body of a public
library or a library employee, respectively.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 416–Assemblymembers Miller, La Rue Hatch,
Anderson, Considine; González and Moore
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the board of trustees of a
school district, the governing body of a charter school, a
school employee or a volunteer and certain persons affiliated
with a public library from limiting access to library materials
under certain circumstances; authorizing the Board of
Regents of the University of Nevada to adopt a policy
containing such a prohibition; prohibiting certain actions
against certain persons which are intended to limit access to
library materials; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a district attorney or city attorney to file a complaint in
the district court to have an item or material declared obscene and to enjoin owner
and possessor of the item or material from selling, renting, exhibiting, reproducing,
manufacturing or distributing it. (NRS 201.241) For these purposes, “obscenity” is
defined in existing law as any item, material or performance which: (1) an average
person applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole,
appeals to prurient interest; (2) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary artistic,
political or scientific value; and (3) depicts or describes in a patently offensive way
certain sexual acts, excretory functions, sadism or masochism or lewdly exhibits the
genitals. (NRS 201.235) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the board of trustees of
a school district, the governing body of a charter school, a school employee or a
volunteer from taking certain actions which limit the access of pupils to library
materials of a school library; and (2) sets forth certain circumstances in which
access to library materials may be restricted for reasons unrelated to the content of
such materials. Section 2 additionally authorizes a person who meets certain
requirements and who objects to the inclusion of any library material in the
collection of a school library to petition a court for the removal of the material and
authorizes a court to order the removal of such material if the court determines that
the material is obscene, based on a definition of obscenity which is substantially
similar to the definition of obscenity in existing law. Section 3.7 of this bill creates
similar provisions governing access to materials in a public library.
The Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose
duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 3.2 of this bill
authorizes the Board of Regents to adopt a policy that prohibits an institution within
the Nevada System of Higher Education or an employee of such an institution from
limiting the access of students and employees to any library materials of a library at
such an institution. Section 3.2 additionally provides requirements that are similar
to those set forth in section 2 with which such a policy must comply.
Section 3 of this bill makes it a crime, punishable as a category E felony, for
any person to use or threaten or attempt to use any force, intimidation, coercion,
violence, restraint or undue influence with the intent to: (1) prevent a pupil from
using or accessing library materials; or (2) induce or compel the board of trustees of
a school district, the governing body of a charter school, a school employee or a
volunteer to violate the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further makes it a crime,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
punishable as a category E felony, for any person to disseminate any personal
identifying information or sensitive information of a member of the board of
trustees of a school district, a member of the governing body of a charter school, a
school employee, a volunteer or a pupil without consent, knowing that the member,
employee, volunteer or pupil could be identified by such information, if: (1) the
person disseminates such personal identifying information or sensitive information
in retaliation for the victim accessing or allowing a pupil to access library materials
from a school library with the intent to aid, assist, encourage, facilitate, further or
promote any criminal offense which would be reasonably likely to cause death,
bodily injury or stalking or with the intent to cause harm to the member, school
employee, volunteer or pupil and with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the
reasonable likelihood that the dissemination of the information may cause death,
bodily injury or stalking; and (2) the dissemination of the personal identifying
information or sensitive information would cause a reasonable person to fear the
death, bodily injury or stalking of himself or herself or a close relation or causes the
death, bodily injury or stalking of the victim whose information was disseminated
or a close relation of the victim. Sections 3.3 and 3.8 of this bill create similar
protections for a member of the Board of Regents, an employee of an institution
within the System or a student and a member of a governing body of a public
library or a library employee, respectively.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
