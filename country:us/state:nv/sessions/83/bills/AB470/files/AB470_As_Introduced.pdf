EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; requiring an
insurer to publish certain information relating to requests
for prior authorization on the Internet; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 health and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health
9 Insurance Program, insurance for public employees and certain entities designated
10 by health insurers to perform utilization reviews.
11 Specifically, sections 15 and 27 of this bill require that a procedure for
12 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services
13 for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review
14 criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 15
15 and 27 also require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
16 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to
-

– 2 –
17 account for any changes in the procedure. Sections 15 and 27 prohibit an insurer
18 from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the failure
19 to obtain prior authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior
20 authorization in effect on the date that the care was provided did not require prior
21 authorization for that care.
22 Sections 15 and 28 of this bill revise the period for insurers to take action on a
23 request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer to approve or make an
24 adverse determination on such a request, or request additional, medically relevant
25 information: (1) within 48 hours after receiving the request, for medical or dental
26 care that is not urgent; or (2) within 24 hours after receiving the request, for care
27 that is urgent. Sections 10 and 29 of this bill require an insurer, in certain
28 circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who requested the prior
29 authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request with a person who is
30 responsible for making a determination on the request. Sections 10 and 29 require
31 an insurer, upon making an adverse determination on a request for prior
32 authorization, to transmit certain information to the insured to whom the request
33 pertains, including information relating to the right of the insured to appeal the
34 adverse determination.
35 Sections 11 and 30 of this bill: (1) provide that a request for prior authorization
36 that has been approved by the insurer remains valid for 12 months; and (2) require
37 an insurer, for the first 90 days of the coverage period for a new insured, to honor a
38 request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the
39 new insured, under certain circumstances. Sections 11 and 30 prohibit an insurer
40 from denying or imposing additional limits on a request for prior authorization that
41 the insurer has previously approved if the care at issue in the request is provided
42 within 45 business days after the date on which the insurer receives the request and
43 certain other requirements are met.
44 Sections 12 and 33 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
45 authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 12 and 33 also prohibit an
46 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
47 earlier than the end of the business day following the date of admission or the date
48 on which the emergency services are provided. Finally, sections 12 and 33: (1)
49 prohibit an insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary
50 emergency services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under
51 certain conditions.
52 Sections 3-9 and 23-26 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
53 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 22
54 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 13 and 32 of
55 this bill provide that if an insurer violates any provision of section 10-12, 15 or 27-
56 31 of this bill with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the
57 request is deemed approved. Sections 13 and 32 also clarify that nothing in the
58 provisions of section 10-12, 15 or 27-31 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1)
59 for care that the insurer does not cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the
60 care; or (2) to persons to whom the insured is not obligated to provide coverage.
61 Sections 14 and 33 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its
62 Internet website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that
63 have been processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year. Section
64 16 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
65 corporation to comply with sections 2-14. Section 17 of this bill requires the
66 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
67 provisions of sections 21-33 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
68 governing Medicaid. Sections 18, 19 and 35 of this bill require plans of self-
69 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
70 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
71 with the requirements of sections 2-15 to the extent applicable. Section 21 provides
-

– 3 –
72 that a health maintenance organization or another managed care organization that
73 provides services to recipients of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
74 Program is not subject to sections 22-33, but must comply with sections 2-15.
75 Section 34 of this bill requires the policies and procedures for coverage for
76 prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 22-33.
