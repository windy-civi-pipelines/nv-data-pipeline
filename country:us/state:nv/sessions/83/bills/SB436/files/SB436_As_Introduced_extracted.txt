AN ACT relating to landlords; requiring the Housing Division of
the Department of Business and Industry to establish a
registry of landlords and a mechanism for a tenant to file
a complaint concerning a landlord; requiring a landlord of
a dwelling unit that does not satisfy certain requirements
for essential items or services to provide a tenant certain
alternative accommodations under certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines the term “landlord” as a person who provides a dwelling
2 unit for occupancy by another pursuant to a rental agreement. (NRS 118A.100)
3 Section 2 of this bill applies to any landlord who: (1) uses a property manager for
4 any number of dwelling units in this State; or (2) owns five or more dwelling units
5 in this State, regardless of whether the landlord uses a property manager for any
6 such dwelling unit.
7 Section 2 requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
8 Industry to establish a statewide registry of landlords that consists of the following
9 information for each landlord: (1) the name of the landlord; (2) the state and county
10 in which the landlord is domiciled; (3) the total number of dwelling units owned by
11 the landlord in this State and the address of each dwelling unit; (4) the amount of
12 periodic rent charged by the landlord for each dwelling unit in this State and the
13 frequency with which the periodic rent is charged to the tenant; and (5) certain
14 information relating to the property manager of the premises, if applicable. Section
15 2 requires each landlord who is not a member of an association to report to the
16 Housing Division the information required to be contained in the statewide registry
17 on an annual basis and at certain other times. If the landlord is a member of an
-
*SB436*
– 2 –
18 association, section 2 requires the association, on behalf of the landlord, to report to
19 the Division the information required to be contained in the statewide registry on an
20 annual basis. Section 2 prohibits a property manager from providing services to a
21 landlord who is not listed in the statewide registry. Section 2 additionally requires
22 the Division to: (1) establish a mechanism for a tenant to file a complaint
23 concerning a landlord; and (2) post such complaints on the Internet website of the
24 Division. Finally, section 2: (1) authorizes the Division to establish by regulation
25 an annual registration fee to be imposed on a landlord who registers with the
26 registry; and (2) requires the Division to use the revenue from such fees to defray
27 the administrative costs associated with implementing the registry of landlords and
28 the mechanism for filing and posting complaints concerning landlords.
29 Existing law provides a tenant certain remedies if: (1) a landlord is required by
30 the rental agreement to provide certain essential items or services and the landlord
31 willfully or negligently fails to do so; (2) the tenant gives written notice to the
32 landlord specifying the breach; and (3) the landlord does not adequately remedy the
33 breach or use his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 48 hours, except a
34 Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, after the notice is received by the landlord.
35 (NRS 118A.380) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes a tenant, at any time
36 after such written notice has been provided and before the landlord has remedied
37 the breach, to submit to the landlord a written request for alternative
38 accommodations. Section 3 requires the landlord to, not later than 24 hours after
39 receipt of the request, provide to the tenant and, with certain exceptions,
40 continuously maintain thereafter until the breach is remedied a comparable
41 dwelling unit or a hotel room, as selected by the landlord, at no cost to the tenant.
42 Section 3 requires the comparable dwelling unit or hotel room to: (1) include
43 certain features, depending upon the amount of time the dwelling unit or hotel room
44 is required; and (2) be located within certain distances of the dwelling unit of the
45 tenant. If a tenant is so relocated, section 3 requires the landlord to pay only certain
46 expenses that arise from the relocation, specifically: (1) under certain
47 circumstances, a per diem allowance in an amount that is at least equal to that
48 provided for state officers and employees; and (2) other reasonable costs incurred
49 due to the relocation, including, without limitation, costs of storage and
50 transportation. Section 3 provides that the provisions of section 3 do not relieve a
51 tenant who is relocated of the obligation to pay rent to his or her landlord.
52 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a tenant is provided a hotel room pursuant
53 to section 3 and, due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the
54 landlord, the breach cannot be remedied by a date which is 60 days after the date on
55 which the tenant’s occupancy in the hotel room began, the obligation of the
56 landlord to provide the hotel room terminates on that date. Section 4 requires a
57 landlord who makes a determination that the breach cannot be remedied within that
58 60-day period to provide to the tenant, at the earliest opportunity, written notice: (1)
59 that the breach cannot be remedied within 60 days; (2) of the date on which the
60 hotel room will no longer be provided at the expense of the landlord; and (3) that
61 the tenant may terminate his or her rental agreement with no liability or financial
62 penalty. Section 4 also requires the landlord to return to the tenant the tenant’s full
63 security deposit, if any, on or before the date on which the landlord provides the
64 written notice pursuant to section 4.
65 Section 5 of this bill provides a tenant the same remedies against a landlord
66 who violates section 3 or 4 as those provided under existing law for failure of the
67 landlord to remedy or use his or her best efforts to remedy a breach relating to an
68 essential good or service.

21 water, hot water, electricity, gas, a functioning door lock or another
22 essential item or service and the landlord willfully or negligently
23 fails to do so, causing the premises to become unfit for habitation,
24 the tenant shall give written notice to the landlord specifying the
25 breach. If the landlord does not adequately remedy the breach, or
26 use his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 48 hours,
27 except a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, after it is received by
28 the landlord, or fails to comply with the requirements of sections 3
29 and 4 of this act, the tenant may, in addition to any other remedy:
30 (a) Procure reasonable amounts of such essential items or
31 services during the landlord’s noncompliance and deduct their
32 actual and reasonable cost from the rent;

42 landlord’s noncompliance, and the rent for the original premises
43 fully abates during this period. The tenant may recover the actual
44 and reasonable cost of that other housing which is in excess of the
45 amount of rent which is abated.
-
*SB436*
– 7 –
1 2. If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not
2 proceed under NRS 118A.350 and 118A.360 as to that breach.
3 3. The rights of the tenant under this section do not arise until
4 the tenant has given written notice as required by subsection 1,
5 except that the tenant may, without having given that notice:
6 (a) Recover damages as authorized under paragraph (b) of
7 subsection 1 if the landlord:
8 (1) Admits to the court that the landlord had knowledge of
9 the lack of such essential items or services; or
10 (2) Has received written notice of the uninhabitable
11 condition caused by such a lack from a governmental agency
12 authorized to inspect for violations of building, housing or health
13 codes.
14 (b) Withhold rent under paragraph (c) of subsection 1 if the
15 landlord:
16 (1) Has received written notice of the condition constituting
17 the breach from a governmental agency authorized to inspect for
18 violations of building, housing or health codes; and
19 (2) Fails to remedy or attempt in good faith to remedy the
20 breach within the time prescribed in the written notice of that
21 condition from the governmental agency.
22 4. The rights of the tenant under paragraph (c) of subsection 1
23 do not arise unless the tenant is current in the payment of rent at the
24 time of giving written notice pursuant to subsection 1.

26 act or omission of the tenant, a member of his or her household or
27 other person on the premises with his or her consent, the tenant has
28 no rights under this section.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to landlords; requiring the Housing Division of
the Department of Business and Industry to establish a
registry of landlords and a mechanism for a tenant to file
a complaint concerning a landlord; requiring a landlord of
a dwelling unit that does not satisfy certain requirements
for essential items or services to provide a tenant certain
alternative accommodations under certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines the term “landlord” as a person who provides a dwelling
2 unit for occupancy by another pursuant to a rental agreement. (NRS 118A.100)
3 Section 2 of this bill applies to any landlord who: (1) uses a property manager for
4 any number of dwelling units in this State; or (2) owns five or more dwelling units
5 in this State, regardless of whether the landlord uses a property manager for any
6 such dwelling unit.
7 Section 2 requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
8 Industry to establish a statewide registry of landlords that consists of the following
9 information for each landlord: (1) the name of the landlord; (2) the state and county
10 in which the landlord is domiciled; (3) the total number of dwelling units owned by
11 the landlord in this State and the address of each dwelling unit; (4) the amount of
12 periodic rent charged by the landlord for each dwelling unit in this State and the
13 frequency with which the periodic rent is charged to the tenant; and (5) certain
14 information relating to the property manager of the premises, if applicable. Section
15 2 requires each landlord who is not a member of an association to report to the
16 Housing Division the information required to be contained in the statewide registry
17 on an annual basis and at certain other times. If the landlord is a member of an
-
*SB436*

– 2 –
18 association, section 2 requires the association, on behalf of the landlord, to report to
19 the Division the information required to be contained in the statewide registry on an
20 annual basis. Section 2 prohibits a property manager from providing services to a
21 landlord who is not listed in the statewide registry. Section 2 additionally requires
22 the Division to: (1) establish a mechanism for a tenant to file a complaint
23 concerning a landlord; and (2) post such complaints on the Internet website of the
24 Division. Finally, section 2: (1) authorizes the Division to establish by regulation

26 registry; and (2) requires the Division to use the revenue from such fees to defray
27 the administrative costs associated with implementing the registry of landlords and

29 Existing law provides a tenant certain remedies if: (1) a landlord is required by
30 the rental agreement to provide certain essential items or services and the landlord
31 willfully or negligently fails to do so; (2) the tenant gives written notice to the

33 breach or use his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 48 hours, except a
34 Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, after the notice is received by the landlord.
35 (NRS 118A.380) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes a tenant, at any time
36 after such written notice has been provided and before the landlord has remedied
37 the breach, to submit to the landlord a written request for alternative
38 accommodations. Section 3 requires the landlord to, not later than 24 hours after
39 receipt of the request, provide to the tenant and, with certain exceptions,
40 continuously maintain thereafter until the breach is remedied a comparable
41 dwelling unit or a hotel room, as selected by the landlord, at no cost to the tenant.
42 Section 3 requires the comparable dwelling unit or hotel room to: (1) include
43 certain features, depending upon the amount of time the dwelling unit or hotel room
44 is required; and (2) be located within certain distances of the dwelling unit of the
45 tenant. If a tenant is so relocated, section 3 requires the landlord to pay only certain
46 expenses that arise from the relocation, specifically: (1) under certain
47 circumstances, a per diem allowance in an amount that is at least equal to that
48 provided for state officers and employees; and (2) other reasonable costs incurred
49 due to the relocation, including, without limitation, costs of storage and
50 transportation. Section 3 provides that the provisions of section 3 do not relieve a
51 tenant who is relocated of the obligation to pay rent to his or her landlord.
52 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a tenant is provided a hotel room pursuant
53 to section 3 and, due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the
54 landlord, the breach cannot be remedied by a date which is 60 days after the date on
55 which the tenant’s occupancy in the hotel room began, the obligation of the
56 landlord to provide the hotel room terminates on that date. Section 4 requires a
57 landlord who makes a determination that the breach cannot be remedied within that
58 60-day period to provide to the tenant, at the earliest opportunity, written notice: (1)
59 that the breach cannot be remedied within 60 days; (2) of the date on which the
60 hotel room will no longer be provided at the expense of the landlord; and (3) that
61 the tenant may terminate his or her rental agreement with no liability or financial
62 penalty. Section 4 also requires the landlord to return to the tenant the tenant’s full
63 security deposit, if any, on or before the date on which the landlord provides the
64 written notice pursuant to section 4.
65 Section 5 of this bill provides a tenant the same remedies against a landlord
66 who violates section 3 or 4 as those provided under existing law for failure of the
67 landlord to remedy or use his or her best efforts to remedy a breach relating to an
68 essential good or service.

– 5 –
1 (a) The comparable dwelling unit or hotel room must include a
2 refrigerator with a freezer and a range, stove or oven; or
3 (b) The landlord must provide a per diem allowance for daily
4 meals and incidentals for each tenant in an amount that is at least
5 equal to the per diem allowance provided for state officers and

9 than 48 hours and for every 24-hour period thereafter.
10 4. A comparable dwelling unit or hotel room must be:
11 (a) Habitable;
12 (b) Accessible to a person with disabilities if the tenant has a

17 unit of the tenant. The landlord may select a comparable dwelling
18 unit or hotel room that is located more than 5 miles but less than
19 10 miles from the dwelling unit of the tenant if the comparable
20 dwelling unit or hotel room that is farther away from the dwelling
21 unit of the tenant is substantially less expensive than other options
22 that are available not more than 5 miles from the dwelling unit of
23 the tenant. If a dwelling unit or hotel room located 5 miles or 10
24 miles, as applicable pursuant to this subsection, from the dwelling
25 unit of the tenant is not available for the use of the tenant in
26 accordance with this subsection, the landlord must select the

30 relocating the tenant:

39 section 3 of this act and, due to circumstances beyond the
40 reasonable control of the landlord, the breach cannot be remedied
41 by a date which is 60 days after the date on which the tenant’s
42 occupancy in the hotel room began, the obligation of the landlord
43 to provide the hotel room to the tenant terminates on that date.
44 2. A landlord who determines that, due to circumstances
45 beyond his or her reasonable control, a breach cannot be
-
*SB436*

– 6 –
1 remedied within 60 days after the date on which a tenant’s
2 occupancy in a hotel room began shall:
3 (a) Provide to the tenant, at the earliest opportunity, written

5 (1) That the breach cannot be remedied by a date which is
6 60 days after the date on which the tenant’s occupancy in the hotel
7 began;
8 (2) The date on which the hotel room will no longer be
9 provided to the tenant at the expense of the landlord, which date
10 must be not earlier than 60 days after the date on which the
11 tenant’s occupancy in the hotel room at the expense of the
12 landlord began; and
13 (3) That the tenant may terminate his or her rental
14 agreement with no liability or financial penalty to the tenant; and
15 (b) Return to the tenant the tenant’s full security deposit, if
16 any, on or before the date that the landlord provides notice to the
17 tenant pursuant to paragraph (a).
18 Sec. 5. NRS 118A.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:

20 agreement or this chapter to supply heat, air-conditioning, running
21 water, hot water, electricity, gas, a functioning door lock or another
22 essential item or service and the landlord willfully or negligently
23 fails to do so, causing the premises to become unfit for habitation,
24 the tenant shall give written notice to the landlord specifying the
25 breach. If the landlord does not adequately remedy the breach, or
26 use his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 48 hours,
27 except a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, after it is received by
28 the landlord, or fails to comply with the requirements of sections 3
29 and 4 of this act, the tenant may, in addition to any other remedy:
30 (a) Procure reasonable amounts of such essential items or
31 services during the landlord’s noncompliance and deduct their
32 actual and reasonable cost from the rent;
33 (b) Recover actual damages, including damages based upon the
34 lack of use of the premises or the diminution of the fair rental value
35 of the dwelling unit;
36 (c) Withhold any rent that becomes due during the landlord’s
37 noncompliance without incurring late fees, charges for notice or any
38 other charge or fee authorized by this chapter or the rental
39 agreement, until the landlord has attempted in good faith to restore
40 the essential items or services; or
41 (d) Procure other housing which is comparable during the
42 landlord’s noncompliance, and the rent for the original premises
43 fully abates during this period. The tenant may recover the actual
44 and reasonable cost of that other housing which is in excess of the
45 amount of rent which is abated.

1 2. If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not
2 proceed under NRS 118A.350 and 118A.360 as to that breach.
3 3. The rights of the tenant under this section do not arise until
4 the tenant has given written notice as required by subsection 1,
5 except that the tenant may, without having given that notice:
6 (a) Recover damages as authorized under paragraph (b) of
7 subsection 1 if the landlord:
8 (1) Admits to the court that the landlord had knowledge of
9 the lack of such essential items or services; or
10 (2) Has received written notice of the uninhabitable
11 condition caused by such a lack from a governmental agency
12 authorized to inspect for violations of building, housing or health
13 codes.
14 (b) Withhold rent under paragraph (c) of subsection 1 if the
15 landlord:
16 (1) Has received written notice of the condition constituting
17 the breach from a governmental agency authorized to inspect for
18 violations of building, housing or health codes; and
19 (2) Fails to remedy or attempt in good faith to remedy the
20 breach within the time prescribed in the written notice of that
21 condition from the governmental agency.
22 4. The rights of the tenant under paragraph (c) of subsection 1
23 do not arise unless the tenant is current in the payment of rent at the
24 time of giving written notice pursuant to subsection 1.
25 5. If such a condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent
26 act or omission of the tenant, a member of his or her household or
27 other person on the premises with his or her consent, the tenant has
28 no rights under this section.
