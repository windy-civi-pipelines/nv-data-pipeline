SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging the Citizens’ Stamp
Advisory Committee and the Postmaster General of the
United States Postal Service for the creation of a postage
stamp commemorating John “Snowshoe” Thompson.
1 WHEREAS, Jon Torsteinson-Rue, more widely known as John
2 “Snowshoe” Thompson, was born in Norway in 1827 and arrived in
3 California in 1851 where he began work as a miner; and
4 WHEREAS, After his attempts at mining failed, Mr. Thompson
5 moved to Placerville, California and took up farming; and
6 WHEREAS, In 1855, Mr. Thompson saw an ad in the Sacramento
7 Union which read “People Lost to the World: Uncle Sam Needs
8 Carrier” and began working as a mail carrier; and
9 WHEREAS, Previous postmen had difficulty traversing the snow-
10 covered Sierra until Mr. Thompson carved a pair of “ski-skates”
11 fashioned after the ski-shaped snowshoes he remembered from his
12 childhood days in Norway and earned the nickname “Snowshoe”;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, Twice a month every winter from 1856 to 1876,
15 Snowshoe Thompson made the daunting and danger-filled 3-day
16 trek from Placerville, California, to Mormon Station, Nevada, later
17 renamed Genoa, and, upon delivery of his cargo and preparation of

1 his load for the return journey, would reverse his course and return
2 to Placerville; and
3 WHEREAS, Dressed in his Mackinaw jacket and wide-brimmed
4 hat, Snowshoe Thompson carried no gun, heavy coat or blankets, in
5 order to focus on the important mail, parcels and life-saving
6 medicines he carried that often weighed between 80 and 100
7 pounds; and
8 WHEREAS, Despite the constantly changing, snow-covered
9 landscape, where landmarks were often obliterated and only the
10 stars were available to guide him when he traveled at night,
11 Snowshoe Thompson did not use a compass because, as he once
12 said, “There is no danger of getting lost in a narrow range of
13 mountains like the Sierra, if a man has his wits about him”; and
14 WHEREAS, Snowshoe Thompson often rescued prospectors
15 caught in the snow, and in one instance, his heroic efforts saved the
16 life of a starving, half-frozen prospector; and
17 WHEREAS, In the 1860s, Snowshoe Thompson homesteaded in
18 Diamond Valley, California and married Agnes Singleton, with
19 whom he had a son, Arthur Thomas; and
20 WHEREAS, Although Snowshoe Thompson was never fully
21 compensated for his efforts as a lifeline between Nevada and
22 California, he continued his deliveries until his death in 1876; and
23 WHEREAS, The bicentennial of the birth of Snowshoe
24 Thompson will be observed on April 30, 2027, and the contributions
25 and heroic deeds of Snowshoe Thompson should be recognized
26 through the creation of a commemorative postage stamp; now,
27 therefore, be it
28 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
29 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd Session of the
30 Nevada Legislature hereby urge the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory
31 Committee and the Postmaster General of the United States Postal
32 Service to recognize and commemorate the contributions of John
33 “Snowshoe” Thompson through the creation of a postage stamp; and
34 be it further
35 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and
36 transmit a copy of this resolution to the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory
37 Committee and the Postmaster General of the United States Postal
38 Service; and be it further
39 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
40 passage.
