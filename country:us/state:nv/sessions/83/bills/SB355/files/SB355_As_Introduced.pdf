EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to renewable energy facilities; revising provisions
governing applications for a partial abatement of certain
taxes for renewable energy facilities that incorporate
agrivoltaics or ecovoltaics; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who intends to locate certain renewable
2 energy facilities in this State to apply to the Director of the Office of Energy for a
3 partial abatement of local sales and use taxes, property taxes, or both local sales and
4 use taxes and property taxes. (NRS 701A.360) Existing law requires the Director to
5 approve an application for the partial abatement if the Director, in consultation with
6 the Office of Economic Development, makes certain determinations, including,
7 without limitation, that: (1) the financial benefits that will result to this State from
8 the facility will exceed the loss of tax revenue that will result from the partial
9 abatement; and (2) the facility is consistent with the State Plan for Economic
10 Development. (NRS 701A.365) Section 5 of this bill requires the Director to
11 approve an application without determining that the financial benefits to the State
12 from the facility will exceed the loss of tax revenue from the partial abatement or
13 that the facility is consistent with the State Plan for Economic Development if not
14 less than 36 percent of the total area of the facility for which the application is
15 made will be devoted to agrivoltaics or ecovoltaics for the duration of the
16 abatement. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define the terms “agrivoltaics” and
17 “ecovoltaics,” respectively.
18 Existing law prohibits the Director from approving an application for a partial
19 abatement unless the application is approved or deemed approved by the board of
20 county commissioners of the county in which the facility will be located. The board
21 of county commissioners is authorized to deny the application only if the board
22 determines that: (1) the projected cost of the services that the local government is
23 required to provide to the facility will exceed the amount of tax revenue that the

24 local government is projected to receive as a result of the abatement; or (2) the
25 projected financial benefits that will result to the county from the facility will not
26 exceed the projected loss of tax revenue that will result from the abatement. (NRS
27 701A.365) Section 5 exempts an application from the requirement to be approved
28 or deemed approved by the board of county commissioners if not less than 36
29 percent of the total area of the facility will be devoted to agrivoltaics or ecovoltaics
30 for the duration of the abatement.
