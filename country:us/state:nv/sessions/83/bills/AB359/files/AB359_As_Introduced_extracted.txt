Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Proposes to exempt sales of certain coins, currency
and bullion from sales and use taxes and analogous
taxes upon approval by the voters. (BDR 32-147)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxes on retail sales; providing for the
submission to the voters of the question whether the Sales
and Use Tax Act of 1955 should be amended to provide
an exemption from the tax for certain coins, currency and
bullion; providing for the exemptions from certain
analogous taxes if the voters approve this amendment to
the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The nonadministrative provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 (part of
2 chapter 372 of NRS) were approved by the voters by a referendum and therefore
3 cannot be amended, annulled or repealed, set aside, suspended or in any way made
4 inoperative except by the direct vote of the people. (Nev. Const. Art. 19, § 1)
5 Existing regulations provide that sales tax applies to sales of coins or bullion at a
6 premium price for purposes other than use as a medium of exchange. However,
7 sales tax does not apply to such sales if the purpose of the use of the coins or
8 bullion is as a medium of exchange, even if the sale is made at a premium.
9 (NAC 372.170)
10 Sections 2-9 of this bill require the submission of a question to the voters at the
11 2026 General Election of whether the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 should be
12 amended to provide an exemption for coins, currency and bullion that are: (1) used
13 solely as legal tender, security or commodity in this or another state, the United
14 States or a foreign country; and (2) sold based primarily on their intrinsic value as
15 precious material or collectible items rather than their representative value as a
16 medium of exchange. Section 10 of this bill amends the Local School Support Tax
17 Law to provide an identical exemption. This tax exemption becomes effective on
18 January 1, 2027, and expires by limitation on December 1, 2050, only if the voters
-
*AB359*
– 2 –
19 approve the amendment to the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 at the General
20 Election in 2026.
21 Any amendment to the Local School Support Tax Law, including exemptions,
22 also applies to other sales and use taxes imposed under existing law. (NRS 354.705,
23 374A.020, 376A.060, 377.040, 377A.030, 377B.110, 543.600 and various special
24 and local acts) Therefore, if the voters approve the exemption on coins, currency
25 and bullion proposed by this bill, from January 1, 2027, through December 31,
26 2050, such coins, currency and bullion will be exempt from all sales and use taxes
27 currently contemplated under existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. The Legislature hereby finds that each exemption
2 provided by this act from any excise tax on the sale, storage, use or
3 consumption of tangible personal property sold at retail:
4 1. Will achieve a bona fide social or economic purpose and that
5 the benefits of the exemption are expected to exceed any adverse
6 effect of the exemption on the provision of services to the public by
7 the State or a local government that would otherwise receive
8 revenue from the tax from which the exemption would be granted;
9 and
10 2. Will not impair adversely the ability of the State or a local
11 government to pay, when due, all interest and principal on any
12 outstanding bonds or any other obligations for which revenue from
13 the tax from which the exemption would be granted was pledged.
14 Sec. 2. At the General Election on November 3, 2026, a
15 proposal must be submitted to the registered voters of this State to

17 Session of the Legislature of the State of Nevada and approved by
18 the Governor in 1955, and subsequently approved by the people of
19 this State at the General Election held on November 6, 1956.
20 Sec. 3. At the time and in the manner provided by law, the
21 Secretary of State shall transmit the proposed act to the several
22 county clerks, and the county clerks shall cause it to be published

SUMMARY—Proposes to exempt sales of certain coins, currency

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxes on retail sales; providing for the
submission to the voters of the question whether the Sales
and Use Tax Act of 1955 should be amended to provide
an exemption from the tax for certain coins, currency and
bullion; providing for the exemptions from certain
analogous taxes if the voters approve this amendment to
the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The nonadministrative provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 (part of

3 cannot be amended, annulled or repealed, set aside, suspended or in any way made
4 inoperative except by the direct vote of the people. (Nev. Const. Art. 19, § 1)
5 Existing regulations provide that sales tax applies to sales of coins or bullion at a
6 premium price for purposes other than use as a medium of exchange. However,
7 sales tax does not apply to such sales if the purpose of the use of the coins or
8 bullion is as a medium of exchange, even if the sale is made at a premium.

10 Sections 2-9 of this bill require the submission of a question to the voters at the
