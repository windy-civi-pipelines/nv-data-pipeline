Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each managed care organization to authorize coverage of
2 a health care service that has been recommended for an insured by a provider of
3 health care acting within the scope of his or her practice if that service is covered
4 by the health care plan of the insured unless the decision not to authorize coverage
5 is made by a physician who satisfies certain conditions. (NRS 695G.150) Section 2
6 of this bill provides that a managed care organization is also not required to
7 authorize coverage if the decision not to authorize coverage is made by a dentist
8 who satisfies certain conditions.
9 Existing law: (1) requires a managed care organization to establish a system of
10 procedures for resolving complaints of a person who is insured by a managed care
11 organization; and (2) provides for the external review of an adverse determination
12 by a managed care organization. (NRS 695G.200-695G.310) The requirement for
13 the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving complaints and the
14 provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an adverse
15 determination also apply to insurers that issue certain policies, plans, contracts and
16 coverage for health insurance in this State that provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for
17 or reimburse costs of health care through managed care, including: (1) certain
18 health insurance provided through a plan of self-insurance for officers and
19 employees of this State; (2) individual health insurance; (3) group health insurance;
20 (4) health benefit plans of small employers; (5) contracts for hospital or medical
21 services; (6) health care plans issued by health maintenance organizations; and (7)
22 evidence of coverage issued by prepaid limited health service organizations. (NRS
23 287.04335, 689A.745, 689B.0285, 689C.156, 695B.380, 695C.260, 695F.230)
24 Existing law exempts a policy or certificate that provides only dental coverage from
25 these provisions. (NRS 695G.243) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
26 requirement for the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving
27 complaints and the provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an
28 adverse determination apply to a policy or certificate that provides only dental
29 coverage.
30 Existing law requires a health carrier to notify certain persons, including a
31 covered person and his or her treating physician, of: (1) an adverse determination
32 relating to a request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or
33 course of treatment; and (2) certain information which must be included in such a
34 notice, including the ability to file a request for an expedited external review if,
35 among other conditions, the insured’s treating physician makes certain written
36 certifications relating to the recommended or requested health care service or
37 treatment. (NRS 695G.245) Section 4 of this bill provides that a dentist may make
38 the required written certifications.
39 Existing law authorizes a covered person, a physician of a covered person or an
40 authorized representative to submit a request to the Office for Consumer Health
41 Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services for an external review
42 of an adverse determination. (NRS 695G.251) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a
43 dentist of a covered person to submit such a request.
44 Existing law requires an independent review organization that receives a
45 request for an external review to: (1) notify the covered person, the physician of the
46 covered person and the health carrier if any additional information is required to
47 conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information received from
48 a covered person or the physician of a covered person; and (3) notify the covered
49 person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative of the
50 covered person and the health carrier of its determination and reasons therefor.
51 (NRS 695G.261) Section 6 of this bill requires the independent review organization
52 to also: (1) notify the dentist of the covered person if any additional information is
53 required to conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information
-
*AB202*
– 3 –
54 received from the dentist of a covered person; and (3) notify the dentist of the
55 covered person of its determination and reasons therefor.
56 Existing law requires an independent review organization to notify a covered
57 person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative, if any,
58 and the health carrier by telephone and in writing after completing its external
59 review. (NRS 695G.271) Section 7 of this bill requires an independent review
60 organization to notify the dentist of a covered person, if applicable.
61 Existing law sets forth the process by which an external review of an adverse
62 determination must be conducted. (NRS 695G.275) Section 8 of this bill revises
63 provisions setting forth that process to provide a covered person’s treating dentist
64 with the same powers and duties with respect to that process as a covered person’s
65 treating physician.
66 Existing law requires the decision of an independent review organization
67 concerning a request for an external review to be based, in part, on documentary
68 evidence, including any recommendation of the physician of the insured. (NRS
69 695G.280) Section 9 of this bill requires that documentary evidence to include any
70 recommendation of the dentist of the insured.
71 Existing law provides a clinical peer who conducts or participates in an external
72 review of an adverse determination immunity from liability for certain damages
73 relating to the external review under certain circumstances. (NRS 695G.290)
74 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “clinical peer” to include certain
75 dentists.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each managed care organization to authorize coverage of
2 a health care service that has been recommended for an insured by a provider of
3 health care acting within the scope of his or her practice if that service is covered
4 by the health care plan of the insured unless the decision not to authorize coverage
5 is made by a physician who satisfies certain conditions. (NRS 695G.150) Section 2
6 of this bill provides that a managed care organization is also not required to
7 authorize coverage if the decision not to authorize coverage is made by a dentist
8 who satisfies certain conditions.
9 Existing law: (1) requires a managed care organization to establish a system of
10 procedures for resolving complaints of a person who is insured by a managed care
11 organization; and (2) provides for the external review of an adverse determination
12 by a managed care organization. (NRS 695G.200-695G.310) The requirement for
13 the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving complaints and the
14 provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an adverse
15 determination also apply to insurers that issue certain policies, plans, contracts and
16 coverage for health insurance in this State that provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for
17 or reimburse costs of health care through managed care, including: (1) certain
18 health insurance provided through a plan of self-insurance for officers and
19 employees of this State; (2) individual health insurance; (3) group health insurance;
20 (4) health benefit plans of small employers; (5) contracts for hospital or medical
21 services; (6) health care plans issued by health maintenance organizations; and (7)
22 evidence of coverage issued by prepaid limited health service organizations. (NRS
23 287.04335, 689A.745, 689B.0285, 689C.156, 695B.380, 695C.260, 695F.230)
24 Existing law exempts a policy or certificate that provides only dental coverage from
25 these provisions. (NRS 695G.243) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
26 requirement for the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving
27 complaints and the provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an
28 adverse determination apply to a policy or certificate that provides only dental
29 coverage.
30 Existing law requires a health carrier to notify certain persons, including a
31 covered person and his or her treating physician, of: (1) an adverse determination
32 relating to a request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or
33 course of treatment; and (2) certain information which must be included in such a
34 notice, including the ability to file a request for an expedited external review if,
35 among other conditions, the insured’s treating physician makes certain written
36 certifications relating to the recommended or requested health care service or
37 treatment. (NRS 695G.245) Section 4 of this bill provides that a dentist may make
38 the required written certifications.
39 Existing law authorizes a covered person, a physician of a covered person or an
40 authorized representative to submit a request to the Office for Consumer Health
41 Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services for an external review
42 of an adverse determination. (NRS 695G.251) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a
43 dentist of a covered person to submit such a request.
44 Existing law requires an independent review organization that receives a
45 request for an external review to: (1) notify the covered person, the physician of the
46 covered person and the health carrier if any additional information is required to
47 conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information received from
48 a covered person or the physician of a covered person; and (3) notify the covered
49 person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative of the
50 covered person and the health carrier of its determination and reasons therefor.
51 (NRS 695G.261) Section 6 of this bill requires the independent review organization
52 to also: (1) notify the dentist of the covered person if any additional information is
53 required to conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information
-
*AB202*

– 3 –
54 received from the dentist of a covered person; and (3) notify the dentist of the
55 covered person of its determination and reasons therefor.
56 Existing law requires an independent review organization to notify a covered
57 person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative, if any,
58 and the health carrier by telephone and in writing after completing its external
59 review. (NRS 695G.271) Section 7 of this bill requires an independent review
60 organization to notify the dentist of a covered person, if applicable.
61 Existing law sets forth the process by which an external review of an adverse
62 determination must be conducted. (NRS 695G.275) Section 8 of this bill revises
63 provisions setting forth that process to provide a covered person’s treating dentist
64 with the same powers and duties with respect to that process as a covered person’s
65 treating physician.
66 Existing law requires the decision of an independent review organization
67 concerning a request for an external review to be based, in part, on documentary
68 evidence, including any recommendation of the physician of the insured. (NRS
69 695G.280) Section 9 of this bill requires that documentary evidence to include any
70 recommendation of the dentist of the insured.
71 Existing law provides a clinical peer who conducts or participates in an external
72 review of an adverse determination immunity from liability for certain damages
73 relating to the external review under certain circumstances. (NRS 695G.290)
74 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “clinical peer” to include certain
75 dentists.
