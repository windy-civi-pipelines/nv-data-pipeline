AN ACT relating to insurance; revising certain definitions for the purposes of
certain coverage for health care services; revising provisions governing
the circumstances under which a managed care organization is not
required to authorize coverage of a health care service; revising the
applicability of certain provisions requiring certain insurers to establish
a system of procedures for resolving complaints of insured persons and
providing for the external review of an adverse determination to
include certain insurers that issue policies or certificates that provide
only dental coverage; revising the information which a health carrier is
required to provide in a notice of an adverse determination; authorizing
a dentist of a covered person to submit to the Office for Consumer
Health Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services a
request for an external review of an adverse determination; requiring
an independent review organization to notify the dentist of a covered
person and a health carrier of certain information and the determination
and reasons of the independent review organization; requiring a
decision of an independent review organization to be based, in part, on
certain documentary evidence, including any recommendation of the
dentist of the insured; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each managed care organization to authorize coverage of a health
2 care service that has been recommended for an insured by a provider of health care acting
3 within the scope of his or her practice if that service is covered by the health care plan of the
4 insured unless the decision not to authorize coverage is made by a physician who satisfies
5 certain conditions. (NRS 695G.150) Section 2 of this bill provides that a managed care
6 organization is also not required to authorize coverage if the decision not to authorize
7 coverage is made by a dentist who satisfies certain conditions.
8 Existing law: (1) requires a managed care organization to establish a system of
9 procedures for resolving complaints of a person who is insured by a managed care
10 organization; and (2) provides for the external review of an adverse determination by a
11 managed care organization. (NRS 695G.200-695G.310) The requirement for the

Assembly Amendment No. 42 to Assembly Bill No. 202 Page 4
12 establishment of a system of procedures for resolving complaints and the provisions setting
13 forth procedures for the external review of an adverse determination also apply to insurers that
14 issue certain policies, plans, contracts and coverage for health insurance in this State that
15 provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for or reimburse costs of health care through managed care,
16 including: (1) certain health insurance provided through a plan of self-insurance for officers
17 and employees of this State; (2) individual health insurance; (3) group health insurance; (4)
18 health benefit plans of small employers; (5) contracts for hospital or medical services; (6)
19 health care plans issued by health maintenance organizations; and (7) evidence of coverage
20 issued by prepaid limited health service organizations. (NRS 287.04335, 689A.745,
21 689B.0285, 689C.156, 695B.380, 695C.260, 695F.230) Existing law exempts a policy or
22 certificate that provides only dental coverage from these provisions. (NRS 695G.243) Section
23 3 of this bill provides that the requirement for the establishment of a system of procedures for
24 resolving complaints and the provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an
25 adverse determination apply to a policy or certificate that provides only dental coverage.
26 Existing law requires a health carrier to notify certain persons, including a covered person
27 and his or her treating physician, of: (1) an adverse determination relating to a request for the
28 provision of or payment for a health care service or course of treatment; and (2) certain
29 information which must be included in such a notice, including the ability to file a request for
30 an expedited external review if, among other conditions, the insured’s treating physician
31 makes certain written certifications relating to the recommended or requested health care
32 service or treatment. (NRS 695G.245) Section 4 of this bill provides that a dentist may make
33 the required written certifications.
34 Existing law authorizes a covered person, a physician of a covered person or an
35 authorized representative to submit a request to the Office for Consumer Health Assistance in
36 the Department of Health and Human Services for an external review of an adverse
37 determination. (NRS 695G.251) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a dentist of a covered person
38 to submit such a request.
39 Existing law requires an independent review organization that receives a request for an
40 external review to: (1) notify the covered person, the physician of the covered person and the
41 health carrier if any additional information is required to conduct the review; (2) forward to
42 the health carrier any information received from a covered person or the physician of a
43 covered person; and (3) notify the covered person, the physician of the covered person, the
44 authorized representative of the covered person and the health carrier of its determination and
45 reasons therefor. (NRS 695G.261) Section 6 of this bill requires the independent review
46 organization to also: (1) notify the dentist of the covered person if any additional information
47 is required to conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information received
48 from the dentist of a covered person; and (3) notify the dentist of the covered person of its
49 determination and reasons therefor.
50 Existing law requires an independent review organization to notify a covered person, the
51 physician of the covered person, the authorized representative, if any, and the health carrier by
52 telephone and in writing after completing its external review. (NRS 695G.271) Section 7 of
53 this bill requires an independent review organization to notify the dentist of a covered person,
54 if applicable.
55 Existing law sets forth the process by which an external review of an adverse
56 determination must be conducted. (NRS 695G.275) Section 8 of this bill revises provisions
57 setting forth that process to provide a covered person’s treating dentist with the same powers
58 and duties with respect to that process as a covered person’s treating physician.
59 Existing law requires the decision of an independent review organization concerning a
60 request for an external review to be based, in part, on documentary evidence, including any
61 recommendation of the physician of the insured. (NRS 695G.280) Section 9 of this bill
62 requires that documentary evidence to include any recommendation of the dentist of the
63 insured.
64 Existing law provides a clinical peer who conducts or participates in an external review of
65 an adverse determination immunity from liability for certain damages relating to the external
66 review under certain circumstances. (NRS 695G.290) Section 1 of this bill revises the
67 definition of “clinical peer” to include certain dentists.

12 the assigned independent review organization shall select health care professionals
13 who meet the minimum qualifications described in NRS 683A.372 and through
14 clinical experience in the past 3 years, are experts in the treatment of the covered
15 person’s condition and knowledgeable about the recommended or requested health
16 care service or treatment.

19 care professionals to be selected to conduct the external review.
20 24. In accordance with subsections 37 to 41, inclusive, each clinical reviewer

24 25. In reaching an opinion, clinical reviewers are not bound by any decisions
25 or conclusions reached during the health carrier’s utilization review process as set
26 forth in NRS 683A.375 to 683A.379, inclusive, or the health carrier’s internal
27 grievance process as set forth in NRS 695G.200 to 695G.230, inclusive.
28 26. Within 5 business days after receipt of the notice pursuant to subsection

26 standard health care services or treatments and the adverse risks of the
27 recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be
28 substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or
29 treatments;
30 (c) A description and analysis of any medical or scientific evidence considered
31 in reaching the opinion;
32 (d) A description and analysis of any evidence-based standards used as a basis

36 39. For an expedited external review, each clinical reviewer shall provide an
37 opinion orally or in writing to the assigned independent review organization as
38 expeditiously as the covered person’s medical condition or circumstances requires,
39 but in no event not more than 5 calendar days after being selected in accordance
40 with subsection 21.
41 40. If the opinion provided pursuant to subsection 39 was not in writing,

1 (d) The terms of coverage under the covered person’s health benefit plan with
2 the health carrier to ensure that, but for the health carrier’s determination that the
3 recommended or requested health care service or treatment that is the subject of the
4 opinion is experimental or investigational, the reviewer’s opinion is not contrary to
5 the terms of coverage under the health benefit plan; and
6 (e) Whether:
7 (1) The recommended or requested health care service or treatment has
8 been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, if applicable, for the
9 condition; or
10 (2) Medical or scientific evidence or evidence-based standards demonstrate
11 that the expected benefits of the recommended or requested health care service or
12 treatment is more likely to be beneficial to the covered person than any available
13 standard health care services or treatments and the adverse risks of the
14 recommended or requested health care service or treatment would not be
15 substantially increased over those of available standard health care services or
16 treatments.
17 42. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 43, within 20 days after
18 receipt of the opinion of each clinical reviewer pursuant to subsection 41, the
19 assigned independent review organization, in accordance with subsection 45 or 46,
20 shall make a decision and provide written notice of the decision to the covered
