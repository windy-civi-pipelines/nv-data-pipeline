CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising certain definitions for the
purposes of certain coverage for health care services; revising
provisions governing the circumstances under which a
managed care organization is not required to authorize
coverage of a health care service; revising the applicability of
certain provisions requiring certain insurers to establish a
system of procedures for resolving complaints of insured
persons and providing for the external review of an adverse
determination to include certain insurers that issue policies or
certificates that provide only dental coverage; revising the
information which a health carrier is required to provide in a
notice of an adverse determination; authorizing a dentist of a
covered person to submit to the Office for Consumer Health
Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services
a request for an external review of an adverse determination;
requiring an independent review organization to notify the
dentist of a covered person and a health carrier of certain
information and the determination and reasons of the
independent review organization; requiring a decision of an
independent review organization to be based, in part, on
certain documentary evidence, including any
recommendation of the dentist of the insured; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires each managed care organization to authorize coverage of
a health care service that has been recommended for an insured by a provider of
health care acting within the scope of his or her practice if that service is covered
by the health care plan of the insured unless the decision not to authorize coverage
is made by a physician who satisfies certain conditions. (NRS 695G.150) Section 2
of this bill provides that a managed care organization is also not required to
authorize coverage if the decision not to authorize coverage is made by a dentist
who satisfies certain conditions.
Existing law: (1) requires a managed care organization to establish a system of
procedures for resolving complaints of a person who is insured by a managed care
organization; and (2) provides for the external review of an adverse determination
by a managed care organization. (NRS 695G.200-695G.310) The requirement for
the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving complaints and the
provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an adverse
determination also apply to insurers that issue certain policies, plans, contracts and
coverage for health insurance in this State that provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for
or reimburse costs of health care through managed care, including: (1) certain
health insurance provided through a plan of self-insurance for officers and
employees of this State; (2) individual health insurance; (3) group health insurance;
(4) health benefit plans of small employers; (5) contracts for hospital or medical

services; (6) health care plans issued by health maintenance organizations; and (7)
evidence of coverage issued by prepaid limited health service organizations. (NRS

Section 2:
287.04335, 689A.745, 689B.0285, 689C.156, 695B.380, 695C.260, 695F.230)
Existing law exempts a policy or certificate that provides only dental coverage from
these provisions. (NRS 695G.243) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
requirement for the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving
complaints and the provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an
adverse determination apply to a policy or certificate that provides only dental
coverage.
Existing law requires a health carrier to notify certain persons, including a
covered person and his or her treating physician, of: (1) an adverse determination
relating to a request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or
course of treatment; and (2) certain information which must be included in such a
notice, including the ability to file a request for an expedited external review if,
among other conditions, the insured’s treating physician makes certain written
certifications relating to the recommended or requested health care service or
treatment. (NRS 695G.245) Section 4 of this bill provides that a dentist may make
the required written certifications.
Existing law authorizes a covered person, a physician of a covered person or an
authorized representative to submit a request to the Office for Consumer Health
Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services for an external review
of an adverse determination. (NRS 695G.251) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a
dentist of a covered person to submit such a request.
Existing law requires an independent review organization that receives a
request for an external review to: (1) notify the covered person, the physician of the
covered person and the health carrier if any additional information is required to
conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information received from
a covered person or the physician of a covered person; and (3) notify the covered
person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative of the
covered person and the health carrier of its determination and reasons therefor.
(NRS 695G.261) Section 6 of this bill requires the independent review organization
to also: (1) notify the dentist of the covered person if any additional information is
required to conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information
received from the dentist of a covered person; and (3) notify the dentist of the
covered person of its determination and reasons therefor.
Existing law requires an independent review organization to notify a covered
person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative, if any,
and the health carrier by telephone and in writing after completing its external
review. (NRS 695G.271) Section 7 of this bill requires an independent review
organization to notify the dentist of a covered person, if applicable.
Existing law sets forth the process by which an external review of an adverse
determination must be conducted. (NRS 695G.275) Section 8 of this bill revises
provisions setting forth that process to provide a covered person’s treating dentist
with the same powers and duties with respect to that process as a covered person’s
treating physician.
Existing law requires the decision of an independent review organization
concerning a request for an external review to be based, in part, on documentary
evidence, including any recommendation of the physician of the insured. (NRS
695G.280) Section 9 of this bill requires that documentary evidence to include any
recommendation of the dentist of the insured.
Existing law provides a clinical peer who conducts or participates in an external
review of an adverse determination immunity from liability for certain damages
relating to the external review under certain circumstances. (NRS 695G.290)

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 202–Assemblymember Brown-May
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising certain definitions for the
purposes of certain coverage for health care services; revising
provisions governing the circumstances under which a
managed care organization is not required to authorize
coverage of a health care service; revising the applicability of
certain provisions requiring certain insurers to establish a
system of procedures for resolving complaints of insured
persons and providing for the external review of an adverse
determination to include certain insurers that issue policies or
certificates that provide only dental coverage; revising the
information which a health carrier is required to provide in a
notice of an adverse determination; authorizing a dentist of a
covered person to submit to the Office for Consumer Health
Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services
a request for an external review of an adverse determination;
requiring an independent review organization to notify the
dentist of a covered person and a health carrier of certain
information and the determination and reasons of the
independent review organization; requiring a decision of an
independent review organization to be based, in part, on
certain documentary evidence, including any
recommendation of the dentist of the insured; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires each managed care organization to authorize coverage of
a health care service that has been recommended for an insured by a provider of
health care acting within the scope of his or her practice if that service is covered
by the health care plan of the insured unless the decision not to authorize coverage
is made by a physician who satisfies certain conditions. (NRS 695G.150) Section 2
of this bill provides that a managed care organization is also not required to
authorize coverage if the decision not to authorize coverage is made by a dentist
who satisfies certain conditions.
Existing law: (1) requires a managed care organization to establish a system of
procedures for resolving complaints of a person who is insured by a managed care
organization; and (2) provides for the external review of an adverse determination
by a managed care organization. (NRS 695G.200-695G.310) The requirement for
the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving complaints and the
provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an adverse
determination also apply to insurers that issue certain policies, plans, contracts and
coverage for health insurance in this State that provide, deliver, arrange for, pay for
or reimburse costs of health care through managed care, including: (1) certain
health insurance provided through a plan of self-insurance for officers and
employees of this State; (2) individual health insurance; (3) group health insurance;
(4) health benefit plans of small employers; (5) contracts for hospital or medical
-

services; (6) health care plans issued by health maintenance organizations; and (7)
evidence of coverage issued by prepaid limited health service organizations. (NRS
287.04335, 689A.745, 689B.0285, 689C.156, 695B.380, 695C.260, 695F.230)
Existing law exempts a policy or certificate that provides only dental coverage from
these provisions. (NRS 695G.243) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
requirement for the establishment of a system of procedures for resolving
complaints and the provisions setting forth procedures for the external review of an
adverse determination apply to a policy or certificate that provides only dental
coverage.
Existing law requires a health carrier to notify certain persons, including a
covered person and his or her treating physician, of: (1) an adverse determination
relating to a request for the provision of or payment for a health care service or
course of treatment; and (2) certain information which must be included in such a
notice, including the ability to file a request for an expedited external review if,
among other conditions, the insured’s treating physician makes certain written
certifications relating to the recommended or requested health care service or
treatment. (NRS 695G.245) Section 4 of this bill provides that a dentist may make
the required written certifications.
Existing law authorizes a covered person, a physician of a covered person or an
authorized representative to submit a request to the Office for Consumer Health
Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services for an external review
of an adverse determination. (NRS 695G.251) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a
dentist of a covered person to submit such a request.
Existing law requires an independent review organization that receives a
request for an external review to: (1) notify the covered person, the physician of the
covered person and the health carrier if any additional information is required to
conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information received from
a covered person or the physician of a covered person; and (3) notify the covered
person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative of the
covered person and the health carrier of its determination and reasons therefor.
(NRS 695G.261) Section 6 of this bill requires the independent review organization
to also: (1) notify the dentist of the covered person if any additional information is
required to conduct the review; (2) forward to the health carrier any information
received from the dentist of a covered person; and (3) notify the dentist of the
covered person of its determination and reasons therefor.
Existing law requires an independent review organization to notify a covered
person, the physician of the covered person, the authorized representative, if any,
and the health carrier by telephone and in writing after completing its external
review. (NRS 695G.271) Section 7 of this bill requires an independent review
organization to notify the dentist of a covered person, if applicable.
Existing law sets forth the process by which an external review of an adverse
determination must be conducted. (NRS 695G.275) Section 8 of this bill revises
provisions setting forth that process to provide a covered person’s treating dentist
with the same powers and duties with respect to that process as a covered person’s
treating physician.
Existing law requires the decision of an independent review organization
concerning a request for an external review to be based, in part, on documentary
evidence, including any recommendation of the physician of the insured. (NRS
695G.280) Section 9 of this bill requires that documentary evidence to include any
recommendation of the dentist of the insured.
Existing law provides a clinical peer who conducts or participates in an external
review of an adverse determination immunity from liability for certain damages
relating to the external review under certain circumstances. (NRS 695G.290)
