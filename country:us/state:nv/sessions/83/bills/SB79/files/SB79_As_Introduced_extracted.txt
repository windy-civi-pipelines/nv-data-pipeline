Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law requires a person to obtain a license or
2 permit to hunt or fish any wildlife. Under existing law, a child who is a resident of
3 this State and under 12 years of age, with certain exceptions, is not required to
4 obtain such a license or permit. Under existing law, a child who is not a resident of
5 this State and is under 12 years of age: (1) is required to obtain a license to hunt but
6 not a license to fish; and (2) may not take a number of fish that exceeds 50 percent
7 of the daily creel and possession limits. (NRS 502.010) Section 2 of this bill: (1)
8 eliminates that prohibition; and (2) provides that such a child who is not a resident
9 of this State, with certain exceptions, is also not required to obtain a license to hunt.
10 Existing law authorizes the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt
11 regulations establishing a program through which a person who holds a tag to hunt
12 a big game mammal in this State and has proven that he or she qualifies for an
-
*SB79*
– 2 –
13 extenuating circumstance may transfer, defer use of or return to the Department of
14 Wildlife his or her tag to hunt a big game mammal in this State. (NRS 502.103)
15 Section 4 of this bill provides that a tag may be deferred under such circumstances
16 only if there will be an open season for the tag that is identical to the current season
17 in the following year.
18 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations providing for the
19 issuance of a duplicate license to replace an unexpired license that has been lost,
20 stolen or destroyed. (NRS 502.110) Section 5 of this bill also requires the
21 Commission to adopt regulations providing for the issuance of a duplicate license
22 to replace an unexpired license that has been surrendered.
23 Existing law requires a person who possesses a tag to hunt a big game mammal
24 and kills an animal that is believed to be diseased and unfit for human consumption
25 to follow certain procedures, including a requirement to provide the whole carcass
26 of the big game mammal for inspection by certain persons. With certain exceptions,
27 if the carcass is determined to be diseased and unfit for human consumption,
28 existing law entitles the holder of the tag who provides the carcass to receive a
29 replacement tag at no charge. (NRS 502.215) Section 9 of this bill provides that,
30 under such circumstances, a person who provides for inspection the carcass of a
31 deer which is infected with chronic wasting disease is not entitled to a replacement
32 tag.
33 With certain exceptions, existing law sets forth fees for certain licenses, permits
34 and tags issued by the Department. (NRS 502.148, 502.240, 502.250) Sections 8,
35 10 and 12 of this bill remove the amounts for such fees and sections 10 and 12
36 instead require the Commission to prescribe by regulation initial reasonable fees for
37 such licenses, permits and tags, which must be equal to the fees as the fees existed
38 before the effective date of this bill. Sections 10 and 12 authorize the Commission,
39 after prescribing such initial fees, to increase or decrease a fee adding the current
40 fee to the product obtained by multiplying the current fee by the percentage
41 increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index between the calendar year in
42 which the fee was established or most recently adjusted, whichever is later, and the
43 calendar year immediately preceding the year for which the adjustment is made. In
44 making such adjustments, sections 10 and 12: (1) prohibit the Commission from
45 increasing or decreasing a fee by an amount that is less than 90 percent or more
46 than 125 percent of the current fee added to the amount calculated by performing
47 the inflationary adjustment; and (2) authorize the fee to be rounded to the nearest
48 whole dollar amount. Section 24 of this bill provides that the existing fees remain
49 in effect until the Commission has established such fees by regulation. Sections 3,
50 6, 7, 11 and 13-23 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the removal of
51 the amounts of such fees from existing law. Section 1 of this bill makes a
52 conforming change to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in section 12.
53 Section 12 also revises the types of tags for which the Commission must prescribe
54 fees by regulation.
55 Existing law requires the Department to issue a resident and nonresident 1-day
56 permit to fish and a resident and nonresident 1-day combination permit to fish and
57 hunt upland game birds and migratory game birds and add consecutive days on
58 such 1-day permits upon the payment of a fee for the 1-day permit and the payment
59 of a fee for each consecutive day added to the permit. (NRS 502.240) Existing law
60 also authorizes the Commission to establish the term of a permit. (NRS 502.030)
61 Section 10 instead requires the Department to issue a resident and nonresident
62 limited permits to fish and nonresident limited combination permits which consist
63 of 1 or more consecutive calendar days in accordance with the term of the permit
64 prescribed by the Commission.

17 limitation, expenses for gasoline, food or any other costs that are
18 generally associated with persons who are engaging in recreational
19 hunting or fishing together.
20 (b) “Guide” means to assist another person for compensation in
21 hunting wild mammals or wild birds and fishing and includes the
22 transporting of another person or the person’s equipment to hunting
23 and fishing locations within a general hunting and fishing area
24 whether or not the guide determines the destination or course of
25 travel.
26 2. Each person who provides guide service for compensation or
27 provides guide service as an incidental service to customers of any
28 commercial enterprise, whether a direct fee is charged for the guide
29 service or not, must obtain a master guide license from the
30 Department. Such a license must not be issued to any person who
31 has not reached 21 years of age.
32 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, each person
33 who assists a person who is required to have a master guide license
34 and acts as a guide in the course of that activity must obtain a
35 subguide license from the Department. Such a license must not be
36 issued to any person who has not reached 18 years of age. The
37 provisions of this subsection do not apply to a person who:
38 (a) Is employed by or assists a person who holds a master guide
39 license solely for the purpose of cooking, cutting wood, caring for,
40 grooming or saddling livestock, or transporting a person by motor
41 vehicle to or from a public facility for transportation, including,
42 without limitation, a public airport.
43 (b) Holds a master guide license which authorizes the person to

– 22 –
1 and has submitted to the Department a notarized statement which
2 indicates that the person is employed by or provides assistance to
3 the guide. The statement must be signed by both guides.
4 4. Fees for master guide and subguide licenses must be [as
5 provided in] prescribed by regulation and collected pursuant to
6 NRS 502.240.
7 5. Any person who desires a master guide license must apply
8 for the license on a form prescribed and furnished by the
9 Department. The application must contain the social security
10 number of the applicant and such other information as the
11 Commission may require by regulation. If that person was not
12 licensed as a master guide during the previous licensing year, the
13 person’s application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of
14 $1,500.
15 6. Any person who desires a subguide license must apply for
16 the license on a form prescribed and furnished by the Department. If
17 that person was not licensed as a subguide during the previous
18 licensing year, the person’s application must be accompanied by a
19 nonrefundable fee of $50.
20 7. It is unlawful for the holder of a master guide license to
21 operate in any area where a special use permit is required without
22 first obtaining a permit unless the holder is employed by or
23 providing assistance to a guide pursuant to subsection 3.
24 8. The holder of a master guide license shall maintain records
25 of the number of hunters and anglers served, and any other
26 information which the Department may require concerning fish and
27 game taken by such persons. The information must be furnished to
28 the Department on request.
29 9. If any licensee under this section, or person served by a
30 licensee, is convicted of a violation of any provision of this title or
31 chapter 488 of NRS, the Commission may revoke the license of the
32 licensee and may refuse issuance of another license to the licensee
33 for a period not to exceed 5 years.
34 10. The Commission may adopt regulations covering the
35 conduct and operation of a guide service.
36 11. The Department may issue master guide and subguide
37 licenses that are valid only in certain management areas,
38 management units or administrative regions in such a manner as
39 may be determined by the regulations of the Commission.
40 Sec. 24. Notwithstanding the amendatory provisions of this
41 act, the fees set forth in NRS 502.148, 502.240 and 502.250, as
42 those sections existed on the day before the effective date of this act,
43 remain in effect until the regulations establishing fees pursuant to

REQUIRES TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE
(§§ 8, 10, 12)
S.B. 79
SENATE BILL NO. 79–COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES
(ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WILDLIFE)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Natural Resources
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to wildlife.
(BDR 45-314)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; revising requirements relating to
licenses or permits for a child who is under 12 years of
age; revising provisions relating to the deferral of the use
of a tag to hunt a big game mammal under certain
extenuating circumstances; revising provisions relating to
the issuance of duplicate licenses; revising provisions
relating to replacement tags for certain infected animals;
requiring the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to
prescribe by regulation fees for certain licenses, permits
and tags; authorizing the Commission to adjust such fees
for inflation; revising the types of tags for which the
Commission must prescribe fees by regulation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law requires a person to obtain a license or
2 permit to hunt or fish any wildlife. Under existing law, a child who is a resident of
3 this State and under 12 years of age, with certain exceptions, is not required to
4 obtain such a license or permit. Under existing law, a child who is not a resident of
5 this State and is under 12 years of age: (1) is required to obtain a license to hunt but
6 not a license to fish; and (2) may not take a number of fish that exceeds 50 percent
7 of the daily creel and possession limits. (NRS 502.010) Section 2 of this bill: (1)
8 eliminates that prohibition; and (2) provides that such a child who is not a resident
9 of this State, with certain exceptions, is also not required to obtain a license to hunt.
10 Existing law authorizes the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt
11 regulations establishing a program through which a person who holds a tag to hunt
12 a big game mammal in this State and has proven that he or she qualifies for an
-
*SB79*

– 2 –
13 extenuating circumstance may transfer, defer use of or return to the Department of
14 Wildlife his or her tag to hunt a big game mammal in this State. (NRS 502.103)
15 Section 4 of this bill provides that a tag may be deferred under such circumstances
16 only if there will be an open season for the tag that is identical to the current season
17 in the following year.
18 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations providing for the
19 issuance of a duplicate license to replace an unexpired license that has been lost,
20 stolen or destroyed. (NRS 502.110) Section 5 of this bill also requires the
21 Commission to adopt regulations providing for the issuance of a duplicate license
22 to replace an unexpired license that has been surrendered.
23 Existing law requires a person who possesses a tag to hunt a big game mammal
24 and kills an animal that is believed to be diseased and unfit for human consumption
25 to follow certain procedures, including a requirement to provide the whole carcass
26 of the big game mammal for inspection by certain persons. With certain exceptions,
27 if the carcass is determined to be diseased and unfit for human consumption,
28 existing law entitles the holder of the tag who provides the carcass to receive a
29 replacement tag at no charge. (NRS 502.215) Section 9 of this bill provides that,
30 under such circumstances, a person who provides for inspection the carcass of a
31 deer which is infected with chronic wasting disease is not entitled to a replacement
32 tag.
33 With certain exceptions, existing law sets forth fees for certain licenses, permits
34 and tags issued by the Department. (NRS 502.148, 502.240, 502.250) Sections 8,
35 10 and 12 of this bill remove the amounts for such fees and sections 10 and 12
36 instead require the Commission to prescribe by regulation initial reasonable fees for
37 such licenses, permits and tags, which must be equal to the fees as the fees existed
38 before the effective date of this bill. Sections 10 and 12 authorize the Commission,
39 after prescribing such initial fees, to increase or decrease a fee adding the current
40 fee to the product obtained by multiplying the current fee by the percentage
41 increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index between the calendar year in
42 which the fee was established or most recently adjusted, whichever is later, and the
43 calendar year immediately preceding the year for which the adjustment is made. In
44 making such adjustments, sections 10 and 12: (1) prohibit the Commission from
45 increasing or decreasing a fee by an amount that is less than 90 percent or more
46 than 125 percent of the current fee added to the amount calculated by performing
47 the inflationary adjustment; and (2) authorize the fee to be rounded to the nearest
48 whole dollar amount. Section 24 of this bill provides that the existing fees remain
49 in effect until the Commission has established such fees by regulation. Sections 3,
50 6, 7, 11 and 13-23 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the removal of
51 the amounts of such fees from existing law. Section 1 of this bill makes a
52 conforming change to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in section 12.
53 Section 12 also revises the types of tags for which the Commission must prescribe
54 fees by regulation.
55 Existing law requires the Department to issue a resident and nonresident 1-day
56 permit to fish and a resident and nonresident 1-day combination permit to fish and
57 hunt upland game birds and migratory game birds and add consecutive days on
58 such 1-day permits upon the payment of a fee for the 1-day permit and the payment
59 of a fee for each consecutive day added to the permit. (NRS 502.240) Existing law
60 also authorizes the Commission to establish the term of a permit. (NRS 502.030)
61 Section 10 instead requires the Department to issue a resident and nonresident
62 limited permits to fish and nonresident limited combination permits which consist
63 of 1 or more consecutive calendar days in accordance with the term of the permit
64 prescribed by the Commission.
