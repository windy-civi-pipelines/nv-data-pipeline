11 2. The court may waive the attendance of a child to be
12 adopted for good cause shown.
13 Sec. 79. 1. If the court finds that the best interest of the
14 child warrants the granting of the petition, an order of adoption
15 must be made and filed, ordering that henceforth the child is the
16 child of the petitioners. When determining whether the best
17 interest of the child warrants the granting of a petition, the court
18 shall give strong consideration to the emotional bond between the
19 child and the prospective adoptive parent. A copy of the order must
20 be sent to the Division by the petitioners within 7 days after the
21 order is issued. In the order, the court may change the name of the

32 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.

25 to the placement preferences.

27 section, the court must provide a description of the facts upon

28 with a copy of any order for visitation with a sibling of the child

30 3. The court may not grant a right to visit the child to any
31 person other than as specified in subsection 1.
32 Sec. 85. 1. The agency which provides child welfare

34 age with special needs due to race, age or physical or mental
35 problems who is in the custody of the agency which provides child

37 judgment of the agency which provides child welfare services, it
38 would be in the best interest of the child to be placed in that
39 adoptive home.
40 2. The agency which provides child welfare services shall in a

*AB227_R1*

– 30 –
1 clear and convincing evidence, that the return of custody or

3 described in NRS 125E.230. If the court orders the Indian child to
4 be returned to the custody of the former parent or prior Indian
5 custodian, the court’s order must include a transition plan for the

31 ICWA compliance report, which must reflect the agency’s view of
32 the petition and advise the court on whether the documentation

34 to make the findings required pursuant to subsection 2. Nothing in
35 this section requires the agency to make a determination of law
36 regarding the documentation provided by the petitioner.
37 2. Upon receiving an ICWA compliance report, the court

44 subsection must include a finding regarding whether the proposed
45 adoptive placement complies with the preferences under
-

– 31 –
1 NRS 125E.350. If the court finds that the proposed adoptive
2 placement does not comply with such preferences or that the
3 documentation provided by the petitioner is insufficient for the
4 court to make a finding, the court shall direct the petitioner to
5 amend the petition to cure the deficiency or file a motion under
6 subsection 3 of NRS 125E.350 for authority to make the
7 placement contrary to the placement preferences under
8 NRS 125E.350.
9 (b) The petitioner failed to satisfy the inquiry requirements
10 under subsection 1 of NRS 125E.210 or, if applicable, the notice
11 requirements under subsection 2 of NRS 125E.220, or if the
12 documentation supplied by the petitioner is insufficient for the
13 court to make those findings, the court shall direct the petitioner to
14 cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended petition.
15 If the court directs the petitioner to file an amended petition
16 pursuant to this subsection or a motion and the petitioner fails to
17 do so within a reasonable amount of time, the court shall order the
18 petitioner to appear and show cause why the court should not
19 dismiss the petition.
20 3. The Division shall adopt regulations providing a
21 nonexhaustive description of the documentation that the
22 petitioners or moving parties in proceedings under this chapter

45 or in which the child may be eligible for membership; and

20 preferences under NRS 125E.350.

22 courts having jurisdiction over adoption matters regarding
23 applications of chapter 125E of NRS, and sections 64, 74, 80 and
24 86 to 96, inclusive, of this act, to adoptions of minor children,

13 about to be so placed, or order the removal of the child if the child
14 was so placed within 6 months before the filing of the petition by
15 the agency which provides child welfare services.
16 2. Whenever the agency which provides child welfare services
17 believes that a person has received for the purpose of adoption a
18 child not related by blood, and the required written notice has not
19 been given, if the agency which provides child welfare services
20 does not proceed pursuant to subsection 1, it shall make an
21 investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, if the home is

43 petition for adoption is provided to all legal custodians or
44 guardians of the child who are required to be provided with such
45 notice pursuant to section 76 of this act, any interested party in the
-
*AB227_R1*

– 43 –
1 adoption, including, without limitation, the prospective adoptive
2 parent, the adoptive child, a sibling of the adoptive child, the
3 agency which provides child welfare services petitions the court to

5 adoption or amend the order for visitation before including the
6 order in the order of adoption.

11 and place of the hearing to the prospective adoptive parent, the
12 adoptive child, a sibling of the adoptive child, the attorney for the
13 adoptive child or a sibling of the adoptive child and the agency

15 sibling requesting the inclusion of an order for visitation in the
16 order of adoption, the court may require the agency which
17 provides child welfare services to provide the clerk of the court
18 with the contact information of the prospective adoptive parent,
19 the adoptive child and the attorney for the adoptive child. If so
20 ordered, the agency which provides child welfare services must
21 provide such contact information under seal.
22 4. The sole consideration of the court in making a
23 determination concerning visitation with a sibling pursuant to this
24 section is the best interest of the child. If a petition is submitted
25 pursuant to subsection 2, the court must not enter an order of
26 adoption until the court has made a determination concerning
27 visitation with a sibling.
28 5. If an order for visitation with a sibling is included in an
29 order of adoption, the court shall, upon the request of a party to
30 the order, provide to the party the case number of the adoption
31 proceeding and any documents or records necessary to enforce,
32 modify or terminate the order.
33 6. A party to an order for visitation may petition for
34 enforcement of the order at any time while the order is in effect. A
35 person who fails to comply with the order is in contempt of court.
36 If a party to an order for visitation withholds the contact
37 information of any person in violation of the order, the court may
38 order the agency which provides child welfare services to provide
39 such contact information to the court under seal.

26 The agency which provides child welfare services may make
27 reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption or with a legal
28 guardian concurrently with making the reasonable efforts required
29 pursuant to subsection 1. If the court determines that continuation of
30 the reasonable efforts required by subsection 1 is inconsistent with
31 the plan for the permanent placement of the child, the agency which
32 provides child welfare services shall make reasonable efforts to
33 place the child in a timely manner in accordance with that plan and
34 to complete whatever actions are necessary to finalize the permanent
35 placement of the child.
36 3. An agency which provides child welfare services is not

38 the court finds that:

– 113 –

2 neglected child;
3 (3) Caused the abuse or neglect of the child, a sibling of the
4 child or another child in the household, and the abuse or neglect was
5 so extreme or repetitious as to indicate that any plan to return the
6 child to the home would result in an unacceptable risk to the health
7 or welfare of the child; or
8 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity
9 of the parent of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained
10 through reasonable efforts;
11 (b) A parent of the child has, for the previous 6 months, had the
12 ability to contact or communicate with the child and made no more
13 than token efforts to do so;
14 (c) The parental rights of a parent to a sibling of the child have
15 been terminated by a court order upon any basis other than the
16 execution of a voluntary relinquishment of those rights by a natural
17 parent, and the court order is not currently being appealed;
18 (d) The child or a sibling of the child was previously removed
19 from the home, adjudicated to have been abused or neglected,
20 returned to the home and subsequently removed from the home as a
21 result of additional abuse or neglect;
22 (e) The child is less than 1 year of age, the father of the child is
23 not married to the mother of the child and the father of the child:
24 (1) Has failed within 60 days after learning of the birth of the
25 child, to visit the child, to commence proceedings to establish his
26 paternity of the child or to provide financial support for the child; or
27 (2) Is entitled to seek custody of the child but fails to do so
28 within 60 days after learning that the child was placed in foster care;
29 (f) The child was delivered to a provider of emergency services
30 pursuant to NRS 432B.630;
31 (g) The child, a sibling of the child or another child in the
32 household has been sexually abused or has been subjected to neglect
33 by pervasive instances of failure to protect the child from sexual
34 abuse; or
35 (h) A parent of the child is required to register as a sex offender
36 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions
37 of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006,
38 34 U.S.C. §§ 20901 et seq.
39 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, for the
40 purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires,
41 “reasonable efforts” have been made if an agency which provides
42 child welfare services to children with legal custody of a child has
43 exercised diligence and care in arranging appropriate, accessible and
44 available services that are designed to improve the ability of a
45 family to provide a safe and stable home for each child in the
-
*AB227_R1*

4 concerning the child for the purposes of NRS 127.152, 127.410 and
5 424.038 , and section 81 of this act, and, if necessary, creating an
6 in-home safety plan for the protection of the child.

9 (a) Evaluate the evidence and make findings based on whether a
10 reasonable person would conclude that reasonable efforts were
11 made;
12 (b) Consider any input from the child;
13 (c) Consider the efforts made and the evidence presented since

17 efforts to create an in-home safety plan;
18 (e) Recognize and take into consideration the legal obligations
19 of the agency to comply with any applicable laws and regulations;
20 (f) Base its determination on the circumstances and facts
21 concerning the particular family or plan for the permanent
22 placement of the child at issue;
23 (g) Consider whether any of the efforts made were contrary to
24 the health and safety of the child;
25 (h) Consider the efforts made, if any, to prevent the need to
26 remove the child from the home and to finalize the plan for the
27 permanent placement of the child;
28 (i) Consider whether the provisions of subsection 6 are
29 applicable; and
30 (j) Consider any other matters the court deems relevant.
31 6. An agency which provides child welfare services may
32 satisfy the requirement of making reasonable efforts pursuant to this
33 section by taking no action concerning a child or making no effort to
34 provide services to a child if it is reasonable, under the
35 circumstances, to do so.
36 7. In determining whether reasonable efforts are not required
37 pursuant to subsection 3 or whether reasonable efforts have been
38 made pursuant to subsection 4, the court shall ensure that each
39 determination is:
40 (a) Made by the court on a case-by-case basis;
41 (b) Based upon specific evidence; and
42 (c) Expressly stated by the court in its order.
