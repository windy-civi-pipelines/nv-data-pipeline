3 revise, reorganize and establish provisions related to the adoption of children. Specifically,
4 sections [1-153] 2-153 and [155-215] 156-215 of this bill make various changes to provide:
5 (1) general provisions applicable to the adoption of children, regardless of the type of
6 adoption; (2) provisions governing the adoption of children in the custody of agencies which
7 provide child welfare services; (3) provisions governing confirmatory adoptions and
8 readoptions; (4) provisions governing close-family adoptions; and (5) provisions governing
9 agency adoptions, identified adoptions and adult adoptions.
10 Sections 2-46 encompass the general provisions applicable to all types of adoptions.
11 Sections 3-29 establish various definitions applicable to adoption proceedings. Section 239

22 Sections [2-46] 48-105 reenact similar, revised or new provisions for the purpose of

24 provide child welfare services.

26 of establishing independent procedures governing close-family adoptions.

28 authorizing a petitioner to confirm the parentage of a child under certain circumstances.

15 must not be made a matter of public record, but must be given in writing and in
16 confidence to the district judge before whom the matter is pending. If the
17 recommendation of the agency which provides child welfare services is adverse,
18 the district judge, before denying the petition, shall give the petitioner an
19 opportunity to rebut the findings and recommendation of the report of the agency
20 which provides child welfare services.
21 Sec. 78. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the prospective

27 cause shown.
28 Sec. 79. 1. If the court finds that the best interest of the child warrants
29 the granting of the petition, an order of adoption must be made and filed,
30 ordering that henceforth the child is the child of the petitioners. When
31 determining whether the best interest of the child warrants the granting of a
32 petition, the court shall give strong consideration to the emotional bond between

34 the Division by the petitioners within 7 days after the order is issued. In the order,
35 the court may change the name of the child, if desired.

45 that remaining in the home of the adopting parent is in the best interest of the

20 petitioner to cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended petition. If
21 the court directs the petitioner to file an amended petition pursuant to this
22 subsection or a motion and the petitioner fails to do so within a reasonable
23 amount of time, the court shall order the petitioner to appear and show cause
24 why the court should not dismiss the petition.
25 3. The Division shall adopt regulations providing a nonexhaustive
26 description of the documentation that the petitioners or moving parties in
27 proceedings under this chapter may submit to the court to document compliance

43 pursuant to subsection 1 into the order of adoption unless, not later than 30 days
44 after notice of the filing of the petition for adoption is provided to all legal
45 custodians or guardians of the child who are required to be provided with such
46 notice pursuant to section 76 of this act, any interested party in the adoption,
47 including, without limitation, the prospective adoptive parent, the adoptive child,
48 a sibling of the adoptive child, the agency which provides child welfare services
49 petitions the court to exclude the order of visitation with a sibling from the order
50 of adoption or amend the order for visitation before including the order in the
51 order of adoption.

10 welfare services must provide such contact information under seal.
11 4. The sole consideration of the court in making a determination
12 concerning visitation with a sibling pursuant to this section is the best interest of
13 the child. If a petition is submitted pursuant to subsection 2, the court must not
14 enter an order of adoption until the court has made a determination concerning
15 visitation with a sibling.
16 5. If an order for visitation with a sibling is included in an order of
17 adoption, the court shall, upon the request of a party to the order, provide to the
18 party the case number of the adoption proceeding and any documents or records
19 necessary to enforce, modify or terminate the order.
20 6. A party to an order for visitation may petition for enforcement of the
21 order at any time while the order is in effect. A person who fails to comply with
22 the order is in contempt of court. If a party to an order for visitation withholds
23 the contact information of any person in violation of the order, the court may
24 order the agency which provides child welfare services to provide such contact
25 information to the court under seal.

5 and to complete whatever actions are necessary to finalize the permanent placement
6 of the child.

16 another child in the household, and the abuse or neglect was so extreme or
17 repetitious as to indicate that any plan to return the child to the home would result
18 in an unacceptable risk to the health or welfare of the child; or
19 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity of the parent
20 of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained through reasonable efforts;
21 (b) A parent of the child has, for the previous 6 months, had the ability to
22 contact or communicate with the child and made no more than token efforts to do
23 so;
24 (c) The parental rights of a parent to a sibling of the child have been terminated

42 protect the child from sexual abuse; or
43 (h) A parent of the child is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the
44 provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh
45 Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 34 U.S.C. §§ 20901 et seq.
46 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, for the purposes of this
47 section, unless the context otherwise requires, “reasonable efforts” have been made
48 if an agency which provides child welfare services to children with legal custody of
49 a child has exercised diligence and care in arranging appropriate, accessible and
50 available services that are designed to improve the ability of a family to provide a
51 safe and stable home for each child in the family, with the health and safety of the
52 child as its paramount concerns. The exercise of such diligence and care includes,
53 without limitation, obtaining necessary and appropriate information concerning the

AN ACT relating to adoption; repealing, reenacting, revising, reorganizing and
establishing certain provisions relating to the adoption of children
through agency adoptions, identified adoptions, close-family
adoptions, confirmatory adoptions, readoptions and adoptions of
children placed in the custody of agencies which provide child welfare
services under certain circumstances; revising various provisions

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various procedures relating to the adoption of children. (Chapter
2 127 of NRS) Sections 48-153, [155-215] 156-215 and 239 of this bill remove, repeal, reenact,
3 revise, reorganize and establish provisions related to the adoption of children. Specifically,
4 sections [1-153] 2-153 and [155-215] 156-215 of this bill make various changes to provide:
5 (1) general provisions applicable to the adoption of children, regardless of the type of
6 adoption; (2) provisions governing the adoption of children in the custody of agencies which
7 provide child welfare services; (3) provisions governing confirmatory adoptions and
8 readoptions; (4) provisions governing close-family adoptions; and (5) provisions governing
9 agency adoptions, identified adoptions and adult adoptions.
10 Sections 2-46 encompass the general provisions applicable to all types of adoptions.
11 Sections 3-29 establish various definitions applicable to adoption proceedings. Section 239
12 repeals various provisions of general applicability, including certain provisions related to the
13 State Register of Adoptions, provisions governing adoption procedures, provisions concerning
14 the licensing of child-placing agencies and provisions related to certain prohibited conduct.
15 Sections 33-46 reenact similar or revised provisions for the purpose of placement in the
16 general applicability provisions.
17 Sections 171-173, 175-177, 183, 185-188, 190, 192, 194, 196-199, 208-212 and 239
18 generally remove and repeal various provisions related to the adoption of children in the
19 custody of agencies which provide child welfare services and close-family adoptions, thereby
20 retaining the procedures related to agency adoptions and identified adoptions in chapter 127 of
21 NRS.

Senate Amendment No. 671 to Assembly Bill No. 227 First Reprint Page 4
22 Sections [2-46] 48-105 reenact similar, revised or new provisions for the purpose of
23 establishing provisions that independently govern adoptions facilitated by agencies which
24 provide child welfare services.
25 Additionally, sections 116-153 reenact similar, revised or new provisions for the purpose
26 of establishing independent procedures governing close-family adoptions.
27 Sections 108-111 establish procedures for confirmatory adoptions for the purpose of
28 authorizing a petitioner to confirm the parentage of a child under certain circumstances.
29 Sections 112 and 113 establish procedures for readoption which authorize certain
30 persons who adopt a child through intercountry adoption to petition the court to readopt the
31 child.
32 Existing law establishes the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children and the
33 Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance. (NRS 127.330, 127.410) Section
34 236 of this bill directs the Legislative Counsel, in the next reprint of the Nevada Revised
35 Statutes, to cause the transfer of each Compact to a new chapter of NRS, respectively.
36 Finally, existing law authorizes an adult to adopt another adult under certain
37 circumstances and establishes various procedural requirements related to such adoptions.
38 (NRS 127.005, 127.190-127.210) Sections [201-203] 193-205 of this bill make various
39 changes relating to the adoption of adults.
40 Sections 154 , 154.5 and 216-235 of this bill make conforming changes related to the

18 of NRS 125E.220, or if the documentation supplied by the petitioner is
19 insufficient for the court to make those findings, the court shall direct the
20 petitioner to cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended petition. If
21 the court directs the petitioner to file an amended petition pursuant to this
22 subsection or a motion and the petitioner fails to do so within a reasonable
23 amount of time, the court shall order the petitioner to appear and show cause
24 why the court should not dismiss the petition.
25 3. The Division shall adopt regulations providing a nonexhaustive
26 description of the documentation that the petitioners or moving parties in
27 proceedings under this chapter may submit to the court to document compliance

8 this chapter, in addition to any other penalty or remedy provided:
9 (a) The agency which provides child welfare services may petition the
10 appropriate district court for an order to restrain and enjoin the violation or
11 threatened violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, or to compel
12 compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
13 (b) The court shall, if a child has been or was about to be placed in a
14 prospective adoptive home in violation of the provisions of this chapter [prohibit]
15 :
16 (1) Prohibit the placement if the child was about to be so placed ; [,] or
17 [order]
18 (2) Order the removal of the child if the child was so placed within 6
19 months before the filing of the petition by the agency which provides child
20 welfare services [.] and the court determines that it is in the best interest of the
21 child for the child to be removed from the prospective adoptive home.
22 2. Whenever the agency which provides child welfare services believes that
23 a person has received for the purpose of adoption a child not related by blood,
24 and the required written notice has not been given, if the agency which provides
25 child welfare services does not proceed pursuant to subsection 1, it shall make an
26 investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, if the home is found suitable
27 for the child, the prospective adoptive parents must be allowed 6 months from the
28 date of completion of the investigation to file a petition for adoption. If a petition
29 for adoption is not filed within that time a license as a foster home must
30 thereafter be issued pursuant to NRS 424.030 if the home meets the established
31 standards. If, in the opinion of the agency which provides child welfare services,
32 the placement is detrimental to the interest of the child, the agency which
33 provides child welfare services shall file an application with the district court for
34 an order for the removal of the child from the home.

40 which is conducting the adoption proceedings with a copy of any order for
41 visitation with a sibling of the child that was issued pursuant to NRS 432B.580.
42 2. The court shall incorporate an order for visitation provided to the court
43 pursuant to subsection 1 into the order of adoption unless, not later than 30 days
44 after notice of the filing of the petition for adoption is provided to all legal
45 custodians or guardians of the child who are required to be provided with such
46 notice pursuant to section 76 of this act, any interested party in the adoption,
47 including, without limitation, the prospective adoptive parent, the adoptive child,
48 a sibling of the adoptive child, the agency which provides child welfare services
49 petitions the court to exclude the order of visitation with a sibling from the order
50 of adoption or amend the order for visitation before including the order in the
51 order of adoption.
52 3. The hearing on a petition submitted pursuant to subsection 2 must be
53 held on the same date as the hearing on the petition for adoption. Any interested

Senate Amendment No. 671 to Assembly Bill No. 227 First Reprint Page 34
1 party is entitled to participate in the hearing. The clerk of the court shall give
2 written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the prospective adoptive
3 parent, the adoptive child, a sibling of the adoptive child, the attorney for the
4 adoptive child or a sibling of the adoptive child and the agency which provides
5 child welfare services. Upon the petition of a sibling requesting the inclusion of
6 an order for visitation in the order of adoption, the court may require the agency
7 which provides child welfare services to provide the clerk of the court with the
8 contact information of the prospective adoptive parent, the adoptive child and the
9 attorney for the adoptive child. If so ordered, the agency which provides child
10 welfare services must provide such contact information under seal.
11 4. The sole consideration of the court in making a determination
12 concerning visitation with a sibling pursuant to this section is the best interest of
13 the child. If a petition is submitted pursuant to subsection 2, the court must not
14 enter an order of adoption until the court has made a determination concerning
15 visitation with a sibling.
16 5. If an order for visitation with a sibling is included in an order of
17 adoption, the court shall, upon the request of a party to the order, provide to the
18 party the case number of the adoption proceeding and any documents or records
19 necessary to enforce, modify or terminate the order.
20 6. A party to an order for visitation may petition for enforcement of the
21 order at any time while the order is in effect. A person who fails to comply with
22 the order is in contempt of court. If a party to an order for visitation withholds
23 the contact information of any person in violation of the order, the court may
24 order the agency which provides child welfare services to provide such contact
25 information to the court under seal.

5 and to complete whatever actions are necessary to finalize the permanent placement
6 of the child.

19 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity of the parent
20 of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained through reasonable efforts;

26 action concerning a child or making no effort to provide services to a child if it is
27 reasonable, under the circumstances, to do so.
28 7. In determining whether reasonable efforts are not required pursuant to
29 subsection 3 or whether reasonable efforts have been made pursuant to subsection
30 4, the court shall ensure that each determination is:
