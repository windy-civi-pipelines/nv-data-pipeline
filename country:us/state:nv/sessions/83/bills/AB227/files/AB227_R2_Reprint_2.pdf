16 within 6 months before the filing of the petition by the agency
17 which provides child welfare services and the court determines
18 that it is in the best interest of the child for the child to be removed
19 from the prospective adoptive home.
20 2. Whenever the agency which provides child welfare services

1 unless, not later than 30 days after notice of the filing of the
2 petition for adoption is provided to all legal custodians or
3 guardians of the child who are required to be provided with such
4 notice pursuant to section 76 of this act, any interested party in the
5 adoption, including, without limitation, the prospective adoptive
6 parent, the adoptive child, a sibling of the adoptive child, the
7 agency which provides child welfare services petitions the court to
8 exclude the order of visitation with a sibling from the order of
9 adoption or amend the order for visitation before including the

15 and place of the hearing to the prospective adoptive parent, the
16 adoptive child, a sibling of the adoptive child, the attorney for the
17 adoptive child or a sibling of the adoptive child and the agency

19 sibling requesting the inclusion of an order for visitation in the
20 order of adoption, the court may require the agency which
21 provides child welfare services to provide the clerk of the court
22 with the contact information of the prospective adoptive parent,
23 the adoptive child and the attorney for the adoptive child. If so
24 ordered, the agency which provides child welfare services must
25 provide such contact information under seal.
26 4. The sole consideration of the court in making a
27 determination concerning visitation with a sibling pursuant to this
28 section is the best interest of the child. If a petition is submitted
29 pursuant to subsection 2, the court must not enter an order of
30 adoption until the court has made a determination concerning
31 visitation with a sibling.
32 5. If an order for visitation with a sibling is included in an
33 order of adoption, the court shall, upon the request of a party to
34 the order, provide to the party the case number of the adoption
35 proceeding and any documents or records necessary to enforce,
36 modify or terminate the order.
37 6. A party to an order for visitation may petition for
38 enforcement of the order at any time while the order is in effect. A
39 person who fails to comply with the order is in contempt of court.
40 If a party to an order for visitation withholds the contact
41 information of any person in violation of the order, the court may
42 order the agency which provides child welfare services to provide
43 such contact information to the court under seal.

17 (b) Set aside the relinquishment of the child for adoption; or
18 (c) Reversed an order terminating the parental rights of the
19 placing parent.
20 2. After a petition for adoption has been granted, there is a
21 presumption for the purposes of this chapter that remaining in the
22 home of the adoptive parents is in the best interest of the child.
23 Sec. 143. 1. The child-placing agency may consent to the
24 adoption of a child under 18 years of age with special needs due to
25 race, age or physical or mental problems who is in the custody of
26 the child-placing agency by prospective adoptive parents when, in
27 the judgment of the child-placing agency, it would be in the best
28 interest of the child to be placed in that adoptive home.

30 manner:

32 needs the child may have.
33 (b) If it determines that the child has any special needs:

4 of age;
5 (c) Becomes self-supporting;
6 (d) Is emancipated; or

10 status or respective obligations of any party to the adoption.
11 5. A court shall waive all court costs of the prospective
12 adoptive parents in an adoption proceeding for a child with special
13 needs if the child-placing agency consents to the adoption of such
14 a child pursuant to this section.

32 4. When the court vacates an order of adoption under this
33 section, the court shall also order that the parental rights of the
34 parent whose consent the court found was obtained through fraud
35 or duress be restored. The order restoring parental rights under
36 this section must include a plan for the physical custody of the
37 Indian child, whether the Indian child will be placed with an
38 agency which provides child welfare services or with the parent.
39 Sec. 145. 1. If an order of adoption of an Indian child
40 under this chapter is vacated, the court vacating the order must

22 under subsection 3 and that the former parent or prior Indian
23 custodian fully understood the explanation.
24 5. At any time before the entry of an order of adoption of an
25 Indian child, the former parent or prior Indian custodian may
26 revoke a waiver executed by the former parent or prior Indian
27 custodian pursuant to subsection 3 by filing a written revocation
28 with the court or by making a statement of revocation on the
29 record in a proceeding for the adoption of the Indian child.
30 6. If an order of adoption of an Indian child under this
31 chapter is vacated other than as provided in NRS 125E.360, an
32 Indian child’s former parent or prior Indian custodian may

11 objections.
12 8. The court shall order the Indian child to be returned to the
13 custody of the former parent or prior Indian custodian or restore
14 the parental rights to the Indian child unless the court finds, by
15 clear and convincing evidence, that the return of custody or
16 restoration of parental rights is not in the best interest of the child,
17 as described in NRS 125E.230. If the court orders the Indian child
18 to be returned to the custody of the former parent or prior Indian
19 custodian, the court’s order must include a transition plan for the

24 registered mail, in which case, the electronic mail address must be
25 included in the agreement. If a parent or adoptive parent refuses
26 or fails to include such an address in an agreement that provides
27 for postadoptive contact, the court may, on the date on which the
28 court enters an order of adoption which incorporates the
29 agreement, order the child-placing agency to provide the court

16 child or another child in the household, and the abuse or neglect was
17 so extreme or repetitious as to indicate that any plan to return the

19 or welfare of the child; or
20 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity
21 of the parent of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained
22 through reasonable efforts;

24 ability to contact or communicate with the child and made no more
25 than token efforts to do so;

2 abuse; or
3 (h) A parent of the child is required to register as a sex offender
4 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions
5 of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006,

15 concerns. The exercise of such diligence and care includes, without
16 limitation, obtaining necessary and appropriate information

32 of the agency to comply with any applicable laws and regulations;
33 (f) Base its determination on the circumstances and facts

36 (g) Consider whether any of the efforts made were contrary to
37 the health and safety of the child;
38 (h) Consider the efforts made, if any, to prevent the need to
39 remove the child from the home and to finalize the plan for the
40 permanent placement of the child;
41 (i) Consider whether the provisions of subsection 6 are
42 applicable; and
43 (j) Consider any other matters the court deems relevant.

– 116 –
1 section by taking no action concerning a child or making no effort to
2 provide services to a child if it is reasonable, under the
3 circumstances, to do so.
