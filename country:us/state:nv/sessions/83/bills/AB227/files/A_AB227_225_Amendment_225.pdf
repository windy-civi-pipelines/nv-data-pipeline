45 related to agreements for postadoptive contact to facilitate the separation of the provisions

48 Existing law also authorizes child-placing agencies and agencies which provide child
49 welfare services to place, arrange the placement of, or assist in placing or in arranging the
50 placement of, children for adoption or permanent free care and establishes certain
51 requirements related to the placements and assistance. (NRS 127.220-127.310) Sections 65-75
52 of this bill reenact and revise such provisions relating to placements and assistance provided
53 by agencies which provide child welfare services. Sections 153-168 of this bill remove the
54 placement and assistance provisions related to agencies which provide child welfare services
55 and make certain other changes related to placing and assisting in the placement children for

61 authorizing a petitioner to confirm the parentage of a child under certain circumstances.

63 readoption which authorize certain persons who adopt a child through intercountry adoption to
64 petition the court to readopt the child.
65 Existing law establishes the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children and the
66 Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance. (NRS 127.330, 127.410) Section
67 [189] 236 of this bill directs the Legislative Counsel, in the next reprint of the Nevada Revised
68 Statutes, to cause the transfer of each Compact to a new chapter of NRS, respectively.

69 Finally, existing law authorizes an adult to adopt another adult under certain
70 circumstances and establishes various procedural requirements related to such adoptions.
71 (NRS 127.005, 127.190-127.210) Sections [150-152] 201-203 of this bill make various
72 changes relating to the adoption of adults.

31 furnish to the court any other information regarding the child or proposed home
32 which is required by the court. The court, on good cause shown, may extend the
33 time, designating a time certain, within which to submit the report. The agency
34 which provides child welfare services may waive this report for a prospective
35 adoptive parent who is related to the child within the third degree of

22 that remaining in the home of the adopting parent is in the best interest of the

30 to the adoption of a child under 18 years of age with special needs due to race,

28 make a determination of law regarding the documentation provided by the
29 petitioner.

37 preferences under NRS 125E.350. If the court finds that the proposed adoptive
38 placement does not comply with such preferences or that the documentation
39 provided by the petitioner is insufficient for the court to make a finding, the court
40 shall direct the petitioner to amend the petition to cure the deficiency or file a
41 motion under subsection 3 of NRS 125E.350 for authority to make the placement
42 contrary to the placement preferences under NRS 125E.350.

45 of NRS 125E.220, or if the documentation supplied by the petitioner is
46 insufficient for the court to make those findings, the court shall direct the
47 petitioner to cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended petition. If
48 the court directs the petitioner to file an amended petition pursuant to this
49 subsection or a motion and the petitioner fails to do so within a reasonable
50 amount of time, the court shall order the petitioner to appear and show cause
51 why the court should not dismiss the petition.
52 3. The Division shall adopt regulations providing a nonexhaustive
53 description of the documentation that the petitioners or moving parties in

Assembly Amendment No. 225 to Assembly Bill No. 227 Page 26

19 as described in section 74 of this act.
20 4. The Division shall adopt any other regulations for the preparation of
21 ICWA compliance reports that are necessary for agencies which provide child
22 welfare services to carry out their duties under this chapter.

24 forms and information to assists petitioners to comply with the requirements

26 act and any related rules or regulations, including, without limitation:

35 jurisdiction over adoption matters regarding applications of chapter 125E of
36 NRS, and sections 64, 74, 80 and 86 to 96, inclusive, of this act, to adoptions of
37 minor children, including, without limitation, identifying when there is reason to

5 into pursuant to section 91 of this act may only be modified or terminated by an
6 adoptive parent petitioning the court that entered the order which included the

26 services.
27 Sec. 100. 1. The agency which provides child welfare services shall
28 complete a home study that investigates the medical, mental, financial and moral

32 adoptive parent or parents.
33 2. If the placement is to be made in a home outside of this State, the agency
34 which provides child welfare services must receive a copy of a report, completed
35 by the appropriate authority, of an investigation of the home and the medical,
36 mental, financial and moral backgrounds of the prospective adoptive parent or
37 parents to determine the suitability of the home for placement of the child for
38 adoption.
39 Sec. 101. 1. A prospective adoptive parent who is subject to a home study

10 of a child for adoption.
11 2. Upon the completion of a home study conducted by an agency which
12 provides child welfare services pursuant to section 100 of this act, the agency
13 which provides child welfare services shall inform the prospective adoptive parent
14 or parents of the results of the home study. If, pursuant to the home study, a
15 determination is made that a prospective adoptive home is unsuitable for
16 placement or detrimental to the interest of the child, the agency which provides
17 child welfare services shall provide the prospective adoptive parent or parents
18 with an opportunity to review and respond to the home study with the agency
19 which provides child welfare services before the issuance of the results of the
20 home study. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.0115, the identity of those
21 persons who are interviewed or submit information concerning the home study
22 must remain confidential.
23 3. An agency which provides child welfare services shall not determine that
24 a prospective adoptive home is unsuitable for placement or detrimental to the

26 (a) Are deaf, are blind or have another physical disability; or
27 (b) Are the holders of a valid registry identification card.
28 Sec. 103. 1. Whenever the agency which provides child welfare services
29 believes that anyone has violated or is about to violate any of the provisions of
30 this chapter, in addition to any other penalty or remedy provided:
31 (a) The agency which provides child welfare services may petition the
32 appropriate district court for an order to restrain and enjoin the violation or
33 threatened violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, or to compel
34 compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
35 (b) The court shall, if a child has been or was about to be placed in a
36 prospective adoptive home in violation of the provisions of this chapter prohibit
37 the placement if the child was about to be so placed, or order the removal of the
38 child if the child was so placed within 6 months before the filing of the petition by
39 the agency which provides child welfare services.
40 2. Whenever the agency which provides child welfare services believes that
41 a person has received for the purpose of adoption a child not related by blood,
42 and the required written notice has not been given, if the agency which provides
43 child welfare services does not proceed pursuant to subsection 1, it shall make an
44 investigation. Upon completion of the investigation, if the home is found suitable
45 for the child, the prospective adoptive parents must be allowed 6 months from the
46 date of completion of the investigation to file a petition for adoption. If a petition
47 for adoption is not filed within that time a license as a foster home must
48 thereafter be issued pursuant to NRS 424.030 if the home meets the established
49 standards. If, in the opinion of the agency which provides child welfare services,
50 the placement is detrimental to the interest of the child, the agency which
51 provides child welfare services shall file an application with the district court for
52 an order for the removal of the child from the home.

Assembly Amendment No. 225 to Assembly Bill No. 227 Page 34
1 Sec. 104. An agency which provides child welfare services shall, to the
2 extent practicable, give preference to the placement of a child for adoption
3 together with the siblings of the child.
4 Sec. 105. 1. If a child who is in the custody of an agency which provides
5 child welfare services is placed for adoption, the agency must provide the court
6 which is conducting the adoption proceedings with a copy of any order for
7 visitation with a sibling of the child that was issued pursuant to NRS 432B.580.
8 2. The court shall incorporate an order for visitation provided to the court
9 pursuant to subsection 1 into the order of adoption unless, not later than 30 days
10 after notice of the filing of the petition for adoption is provided to all legal
11 custodians or guardians of the child who are required to be provided with such
12 notice pursuant to section 76 of this act, any interested party in the adoption,
13 including, without limitation, the prospective adoptive parent, the adoptive child,
14 a sibling of the adoptive child, the agency which provides child welfare services
15 petitions the court to exclude the order of visitation with a sibling from the order
16 of adoption or amend the order for visitation before including the order in the
17 order of adoption.
18 3. The hearing on a petition submitted pursuant to subsection 2 must be
19 held on the same date as the hearing on the petition for adoption. Any interested
20 party is entitled to participate in the hearing. The clerk of the court shall give
21 written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the prospective adoptive
22 parent, the adoptive child, a sibling of the adoptive child, the attorney for the
23 adoptive child or a sibling of the adoptive child and the agency which provides
24 child welfare services. Upon the petition of a sibling requesting the inclusion of
25 an order for visitation in the order of adoption, the court may require the agency
26 which provides child welfare services to provide the clerk of the court with the
27 contact information of the prospective adoptive parent, the adoptive child and the
28 attorney for the adoptive child. If so ordered, the agency which provides child
29 welfare services must provide such contact information under seal.
30 4. The sole consideration of the court in making a determination
31 concerning visitation with a sibling pursuant to this section is the best interest of
32 the child. If a petition is submitted pursuant to subsection 2, the court must not
33 enter an order of adoption until the court has made a determination concerning
34 visitation with a sibling.
35 5. If an order for visitation with a sibling is included in an order of
36 adoption, the court shall, upon the request of a party to the order, provide to the
37 party the case number of the adoption proceeding and any documents or records
38 necessary to enforce, modify or terminate the order.
39 6. A party to an order for visitation may petition for enforcement of the
40 order at any time while the order is in effect. A person who fails to comply with
41 the order is in contempt of court. If a party to an order for visitation withholds
42 the contact information of any person in violation of the order, the court may
43 order the agency which provides child welfare services to provide such contact
44 information to the court under seal.
45 Sec. 106. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
46 chapter to consist of the provisions set forth as sections 107 to 114, inclusive, of

Assembly Amendment No. 225 to Assembly Bill No. 227 Page 67
1 (b) The agreement is incorporated into an order [or decree] of adoption; and
2 (c) [In the case of an agreement that concerns a child who was in the custody

4 (1) The agency which provides child welfare services has determined that
5 the agreement is in the best interest of the child; or
6 (2) The court has determined, after a hearing, that the agreement is in the
7 best interest of the child.] The agreement is signed by the parent or parents
8 before:
9 (1) The termination or voluntary relinquishment of the parental rights of

11 (2) The execution of a specific consent to adoption or relinquishment.
12 3. The identity of a [natural] parent is not required to be included in an

16 4. A [natural] parent or adoptive parent who enters into an agreement that
17 provides for postadoptive contact shall include in the agreement an address at

20 receive service by alternate means through electronic mail rather than certified
21 or registered mail, in which case, the electronic mail address must be included in
22 the agreement. If a [natural] parent or adoptive parent refuses or fails to include
23 such an address in an agreement that provides for postadoptive contact, the court
24 may, on the date on which the court enters an order [or decree] of adoption which
25 incorporates the agreement, order the child-placing agency [which provides child
26 welfare services] to provide the court with the contact information of the [natural]
27 parent or adoptive parent who refused or failed to include [his or her] the address. If
28 a court so orders, the court shall:
29 (a) Append the address to the agreement for postadoptive contact; and
30 (b) Make the address available to any party to the agreement who wishes to file
31 a petition pursuant to NRS 127.1885.
32 5. If a [natural] parent or adoptive parent changes [his or her] the address that
33 was included in an agreement that provides for postadoptive contact pursuant to
34 subsection 4, the parent shall file with the clerk of the court notice of the change of
35 address within 15 days after the change of address.

39 (a) The child reaches 18 years of age;
40 (b) The child becomes emancipated; or
41 (c) The agreement is terminated.
42 7. The establishment of an agreement that provides for postadoptive contact

29 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
30 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
31 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
32 record that is not otherwise confidential.
33 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
34 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

38 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
39 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
40 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an

11 Sec. 230. NRS 432B.393 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 432B.393 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agency which
13 provides child welfare services shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and

15 (a) Before the placement of the child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the
16 need to remove the child from the home; and
17 (b) To make it possible for the safe return of the child to the home.
18 2. In determining the reasonable efforts required by subsection 1, the health
19 and safety of the child must be the paramount concern. The agency which provides
20 child welfare services may make reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption
21 or with a legal guardian concurrently with making the reasonable efforts required
22 pursuant to subsection 1. If the court determines that continuation of the reasonable
23 efforts required by subsection 1 is inconsistent with the plan for the permanent
24 placement of the child, the agency which provides child welfare services shall make
25 reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with that plan
26 and to complete whatever actions are necessary to finalize the permanent placement
27 of the child.
28 3. An agency which provides child welfare services is not required to make
29 the reasonable efforts required by subsection 1 if the court finds that:
30 (a) A parent or other person responsible for the child’s welfare has:
31 (1) Committed, aided or abetted in the commission of, or attempted,
32 conspired or solicited to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter;
33 (2) Caused the abuse or neglect of the child, or of another child of the
34 parent or other person responsible for the child’s welfare, which resulted in
35 substantial bodily harm to the abused or neglected child;
36 (3) Caused the abuse or neglect of the child, a sibling of the child or
37 another child in the household, and the abuse or neglect was so extreme or
38 repetitious as to indicate that any plan to return the child to the home would result
39 in an unacceptable risk to the health or welfare of the child; or
40 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity of the parent
41 of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained through reasonable efforts;
42 (b) A parent of the child has, for the previous 6 months, had the ability to
43 contact or communicate with the child and made no more than token efforts to do
44 so;
45 (c) The parental rights of a parent to a sibling of the child have been terminated
46 by a court order upon any basis other than the execution of a voluntary
47 relinquishment of those rights by a natural parent, and the court order is not
48 currently being appealed;
49 (d) The child or a sibling of the child was previously removed from the home,
50 adjudicated to have been abused or neglected, returned to the home and
51 subsequently removed from the home as a result of additional abuse or neglect;
52 (e) The child is less than 1 year of age, the father of the child is not married to
53 the mother of the child and the father of the child:

Assembly Amendment No. 225 to Assembly Bill No. 227 Page 85
1 (1) Has failed within 60 days after learning of the birth of the child, to visit
2 the child, to commence proceedings to establish his paternity of the child or to
3 provide financial support for the child; or
4 (2) Is entitled to seek custody of the child but fails to do so within 60 days
5 after learning that the child was placed in foster care;
6 (f) The child was delivered to a provider of emergency services pursuant to
7 NRS 432B.630;
8 (g) The child, a sibling of the child or another child in the household has been
9 sexually abused or has been subjected to neglect by pervasive instances of failure to
10 protect the child from sexual abuse; or
11 (h) A parent of the child is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions of the federal Adam Walsh
13 Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 34 U.S.C. §§ 20901 et seq.
14 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, for the purposes of this
15 section, unless the context otherwise requires, “reasonable efforts” have been made
16 if an agency which provides child welfare services to children with legal custody of
17 a child has exercised diligence and care in arranging appropriate, accessible and
18 available services that are designed to improve the ability of a family to provide a
19 safe and stable home for each child in the family, with the health and safety of the
20 child as its paramount concerns. The exercise of such diligence and care includes,
21 without limitation, obtaining necessary and appropriate information concerning the
22 child for the purposes of NRS 127.152, 127.410 and 424.038 , and section 81 of
23 this act, and, if necessary, creating an in-home safety plan for the protection of the
24 child.
25 5. In determining whether reasonable efforts have been made pursuant to
26 subsection 4, the court shall:
27 (a) Evaluate the evidence and make findings based on whether a reasonable
28 person would conclude that reasonable efforts were made;
29 (b) Consider any input from the child;
30 (c) Consider the efforts made and the evidence presented since the previous
31 finding of the court concerning reasonable efforts;
32 (d) Consider the diligence and care that the agency is legally authorized and
33 able to exercise, including, without limitation, the efforts to create an in-home
34 safety plan;
35 (e) Recognize and take into consideration the legal obligations of the agency to
36 comply with any applicable laws and regulations;
37 (f) Base its determination on the circumstances and facts concerning the
38 particular family or plan for the permanent placement of the child at issue;
39 (g) Consider whether any of the efforts made were contrary to the health and
40 safety of the child;
41 (h) Consider the efforts made, if any, to prevent the need to remove the child
42 from the home and to finalize the plan for the permanent placement of the child;
43 (i) Consider whether the provisions of subsection 6 are applicable; and
44 (j) Consider any other matters the court deems relevant.
45 6. An agency which provides child welfare services may satisfy the
46 requirement of making reasonable efforts pursuant to this section by taking no
47 action concerning a child or making no effort to provide services to a child if it is
48 reasonable, under the circumstances, to do so.
49 7. In determining whether reasonable efforts are not required pursuant to
50 subsection 3 or whether reasonable efforts have been made pursuant to subsection
51 4, the court shall ensure that each determination is:
52 (a) Made by the court on a case-by-case basis;
53 (b) Based upon specific evidence; and

Assembly Amendment No. 225 to Assembly Bill No. 227 Page 86
1 (c) Expressly stated by the court in its order.
2 8. As used in this section, “in-home safety plan” means a plan created by an
3 agency which provides child welfare services to ensure the protection of a child in
4 [his or her] the home, including, without limitation, determining any vulnerabilities
5 of the child, managing any potential threats to the safety of the child and
6 determining the capacity of the person responsible for the welfare of the child to
7 care for the child.
