CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to adoption; repealing, reenacting, revising,
reorganizing and establishing certain provisions relating to
the adoption of children through agency adoptions, identified
adoptions, close-family adoptions, confirmatory adoptions,
readoptions and adoptions of children placed in the custody
of agencies which provide child welfare services under
certain circumstances; revising various provisions relating to
the adoption of adults; requiring the Division of Child and
Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
Services to adopt various regulations; directing the
Legislative Counsel to make various organizational changes
concerning the placement of certain compacts for adoption in
the Nevada Revised Statutes; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes various procedures relating to the adoption of children.
(Chapter 127 of NRS) Sections 48-153, 156-215 and 239 of this bill remove,
repeal, reenact, revise, reorganize and establish provisions related to the adoption of
children. Specifically, sections 2-153 and 156-215 of this bill make various
changes to provide: (1) general provisions applicable to the adoption of children,
regardless of the type of adoption; (2) provisions governing the adoption of
children in the custody of agencies which provide child welfare services; (3)
provisions governing confirmatory adoptions and readoptions; (4) provisions
governing close-family adoptions; and (5) provisions governing agency adoptions,
identified adoptions and adult adoptions.
Sections 2-46 encompass the general provisions applicable to all types of
adoptions. Sections 3-29 establish various definitions applicable to adoption
proceedings. Section 239 repeals various provisions of general applicability,
including certain provisions related to the State Register of Adoptions, provisions
governing adoption procedures, provisions concerning the licensing of child-
placing agencies and provisions related to certain prohibited conduct. Sections 33-
46 reenact similar or revised provisions for the purpose of placement in the general
applicability provisions.
Sections 171-173, 175-177, 183, 185-188, 190, 192, 194, 196-199, 208-212
and 239 generally remove and repeal various provisions related to the adoption of
children in the custody of agencies which provide child welfare services and close-
family adoptions, thereby retaining the procedures related to agency adoptions and
identified adoptions in chapter 127 of NRS.
Sections 48-105 reenact similar, revised or new provisions for the purpose of
establishing provisions that independently govern adoptions facilitated by agencies
which provide child welfare services.
Additionally, sections 116-153 reenact similar, revised or new provisions for
the purpose of establishing independent procedures governing close-family
adoptions.

83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Sections 108-111 establish procedures for confirmatory adoptions for the
purpose of authorizing a petitioner to confirm the parentage of a child under certain
circumstances.
Sections 112 and 113 establish procedures for readoption which authorize
certain persons who adopt a child through intercountry adoption to petition the
court to readopt the child.
Existing law establishes the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children
and the Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance. (NRS 127.330,
127.410) Section 236 of this bill directs the Legislative Counsel, in the next reprint
of the Nevada Revised Statutes, to cause the transfer of each Compact to a new
chapter of NRS, respectively.
Finally, existing law authorizes an adult to adopt another adult under certain
circumstances and establishes various procedural requirements related to such
adoptions. (NRS 127.005, 127.190-127.210) Sections 193-205 of this bill make
various changes relating to the adoption of adults.
Sections 154, 154.5 and 216-235 of this bill make conforming changes related
to the reorganization of the provisions governing adoption.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

shall give strong consideration to the emotional bond between the
child and the prospective adoptive parent. A copy of the order must
be sent to the Division by the petitioners within 7 days after the
order is issued. In the order, the court may change the name of the

order the agency which provides child welfare services to provide
such contact information to the court under seal.

alternate means through electronic mail rather than certified or
registered mail, in which case, the electronic mail address must be
included in the agreement. If a parent or adoptive parent refuses
or fails to include such an address in an agreement that provides
for postadoptive contact, the court may, on the date on which the
court enters an order of adoption which incorporates the
agreement, order the child-placing agency to provide the court

court notice of the change of address within 15 days after the
change of address.
6. A court that enters an order of adoption which
incorporates an agreement that provides for postadoptive contact
shall retain jurisdiction to enforce, modify or terminate the
agreement that provides for postadoptive contact until:
(a) The child reaches 18 years of age;
(b) The child becomes emancipated; or
(c) The agreement is terminated.
7. The establishment of an agreement that provides for
postadoptive contact does not affect the rights of an adoptive
parent as the legal parent of the child as set forth in section 38 of
this act.
Sec. 148. 1. Each prospective adoptive parent of a child to
be adopted who enters into an agreement that provides for
postadoptive contact pursuant to section 147 of this act shall notify

reasonable and uniform standards for establishing whether
immediate action is necessary to protect the child from injury, abuse

(a) Before the placement of the child in foster care, to prevent or
eliminate the need to remove the child from the home; and
(b) To make it possible for the safe return of the child to the
home.
2. In determining the reasonable efforts required by subsection
1, the health and safety of the child must be the paramount concern.
The agency which provides child welfare services may make
reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption or with a legal
guardian concurrently with making the reasonable efforts required
pursuant to subsection 1. If the court determines that continuation of
the reasonable efforts required by subsection 1 is inconsistent with
the plan for the permanent placement of the child, the agency which
provides child welfare services shall make reasonable efforts to
place the child in a timely manner in accordance with that plan and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 119 –
to complete whatever actions are necessary to finalize the permanent
placement of the child.
3. An agency which provides child welfare services is not
required to make the reasonable efforts required by subsection 1 if
the court finds that:

has:
(1) Committed, aided or abetted in the commission of, or
attempted, conspired or solicited to commit murder or voluntary
manslaughter;
(2) Caused the abuse or neglect of the child, or of another
child of the parent or other person responsible for the child’s
welfare, which resulted in substantial bodily harm to the abused or
neglected child;
(3) Caused the abuse or neglect of the child, a sibling of the
child or another child in the household, and the abuse or neglect was
so extreme or repetitious as to indicate that any plan to return the
child to the home would result in an unacceptable risk to the health
or welfare of the child; or
(4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity
of the parent of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained
through reasonable efforts;
(b) A parent of the child has, for the previous 6 months, had the
ability to contact or communicate with the child and made no more
than token efforts to do so;
(c) The parental rights of a parent to a sibling of the child have
been terminated by a court order upon any basis other than the
execution of a voluntary relinquishment of those rights by a natural
parent, and the court order is not currently being appealed;
(d) The child or a sibling of the child was previously removed
from the home, adjudicated to have been abused or neglected,
returned to the home and subsequently removed from the home as a
result of additional abuse or neglect;
(e) The child is less than 1 year of age, the father of the child is
not married to the mother of the child and the father of the child:
(1) Has failed within 60 days after learning of the birth of the
child, to visit the child, to commence proceedings to establish his
paternity of the child or to provide financial support for the child; or
(2) Is entitled to seek custody of the child but fails to do so
within 60 days after learning that the child was placed in foster care;
(f) The child was delivered to a provider of emergency services
pursuant to NRS 432B.630;

household has been sexually abused or has been subjected to neglect
by pervasive instances of failure to protect the child from sexual

pursuant to the provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions
of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006,
34 U.S.C. §§ 20901 et seq.
4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, for the
purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires,
“reasonable efforts” have been made if an agency which provides
child welfare services to children with legal custody of a child has
exercised diligence and care in arranging appropriate, accessible and
available services that are designed to improve the ability of a
family to provide a safe and stable home for each child in the
family, with the health and safety of the child as its paramount
concerns. The exercise of such diligence and care includes, without
limitation, obtaining necessary and appropriate information
concerning the child for the purposes of NRS 127.152, 127.410 and
424.038 , and section 81 of this act, and, if necessary, creating an
in-home safety plan for the protection of the child.
5. In determining whether reasonable efforts have been made

that occurs after the termination of parental rights to the child or a
sibling or the adoption of a sibling.
(c) Information concerning the child’s education, including:

program, the determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection
9 must include, without limitation, a finding on each factor
prescribed by subsection 4 of NRS 432B.575.
11. The provision of notice and a right to be heard pursuant to

to the hearing.
