30 13. As used in this section:

-
*AB227*

1 finding and, if the placement departs from the placement
2 preferences under NRS 125E.350, detailed documentation of the
3 efforts to comply with the placement preferences.
4 Sec. 57. 1. In a proceeding for the adoption of a child, not

6 agency which provides child welfare services as required pursuant
7 to section 39 of this act, the agency which provides child welfare
8 services shall file with the court an ICWA compliance report,
9 which must reflect the review by the agency which provides child
10 welfare services of the petition and advise the court on whether the
11 documentation submitted by the petitioner is sufficient and
12 complete for the court to make the findings required pursuant to
13 subsection 2. Nothing in this section requires the agency which
14 provides child welfare services to make a determination of law
15 regarding the documentation provided by the petitioner.
16 2. Upon receiving an ICWA compliance report, the court
17 shall order the matter to proceed if the court finds that the
18 petitioner satisfied the inquiry requirements under subsection 1 of
19 NRS 125E.210 and, if applicable, the notice requirements under
20 subsection 2 of NRS 125E.220. If the court finds that:
21 (a) Subject to the procedures under subsection 3 of NRS
22 125E.210, the child is an Indian child, the order by the court
23 under this subsection must include a finding regarding whether
24 the proposed adoptive placement complies with the preferences
25 under NRS 125E.350. If the court finds that the proposed adoptive
26 placement does not comply with such preferences or that the
27 documentation provided by the petitioner is insufficient for the
28 court to make a finding, the court shall direct the petitioner to
29 amend the petition to cure the deficiency or file a motion under
30 subsection 3 of NRS 125E.350, for authority to make the
31 placement contrary to the placement preferences under
32 NRS 125E.350.
33 (b) The petitioner failed to satisfy the inquiry requirements
34 under subsection 1 of NRS 125E.210 or, if applicable, the notice
35 requirements under subsection 2 of NRS 125E.220, or if the
36 documentation supplied by the petitioner is insufficient for the
37 court to make those findings, the court shall direct the petitioner to
38 cure the inquiry or notice deficiency and file an amended petition.
39 If the court directs the petitioner to file an amended petition
40 pursuant to this subsection or a motion and the petitioner fails to
41 do so within a reasonable amount of time, the court shall order the
42 petitioner to appear and show cause why the court should not
43 dismiss the petition.
44 3. The Division shall adopt regulations providing a
45 nonexhaustive description of the documentation that petitioners or
-

10 the petitioner or moving party obtained;
11 (b) Descriptions of any oral responses and copies of any
12 written responses the petitioner or moving party obtained from the

16 indicating the membership of the child or the parent of the child in
17 an Indian tribe;

21 documenting the due diligence of the petitioner or moving party to
22 identify and work with all of the tribes of which the petitioner or
23 moving party has reason to know that the child may be a member
24 or in which the child may be eligible for membership; and
25 (f) The declaration of compliance regarding the notices the
26 petitioner sent, as described in NRS 127.115 and section 39 of this
27 act.
28 4. The Division shall adopt any other regulations for the
29 preparation of ICWA compliance reports that are necessary for
30 agencies which provide child welfare services to carry out their
31 duties under this chapter.
32 5. The Court Administrator may prepare and make available
33 to the public forms and information to assist petitioners to comply
34 with the requirements under this section and NRS 125E.210,
35 125E.220, 125E.350 and 127.115 and section 39 of this act and

18 (a) The appropriate agency which provides child welfare

32 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity
33 of the parent of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained

15 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions
16 of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006,
17 34 U.S.C. §§ 20901 et seq.
18 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, for the
19 purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires,
20 “reasonable efforts” have been made if an agency which provides
21 child welfare services to children with legal custody of a child has

6 (h) Consider the efforts made, if any, to prevent the need to
7 remove the child from the home and to finalize the plan for the
8 permanent placement of the child;
9 (i) Consider whether the provisions of subsection 6 are
10 applicable; and
11 (j) Consider any other matters the court deems relevant.

14 section by taking no action concerning a child or making no effort to
15 provide services to a child if it is reasonable, under the
16 circumstances, to do so.
17 7. In determining whether reasonable efforts are not required
18 pursuant to subsection 3 or whether reasonable efforts have been
19 made pursuant to subsection 4, the court shall ensure that each
20 determination is:

-
*AB227*

– 22 –
1 the district court made under the provisions of this chapter, in the
2 same manner as in other civil proceedings.
3 Sec. 53. 1. The agency which provides child welfare
4 services may consent to the adoption of a child with special needs
5 who is in the custody of the agency which provides child welfare
6 services by prospective adoptive parents when, in the judgment of
7 the agency which provides child welfare services, it would be in

24 grant financial assistance for attorney’s fees in the adoption
25 proceeding, for maintenance and for preexisting physical or

-
*AB227*

1 finding and, if the placement departs from the placement
2 preferences under NRS 125E.350, detailed documentation of the
3 efforts to comply with the placement preferences.
4 Sec. 57. 1. In a proceeding for the adoption of a child, not
5 later than 90 days after service of a petition upon the appropriate

7 to section 39 of this act, the agency which provides child welfare
8 services shall file with the court an ICWA compliance report,
9 which must reflect the review by the agency which provides child
10 welfare services of the petition and advise the court on whether the
11 documentation submitted by the petitioner is sufficient and
12 complete for the court to make the findings required pursuant to
13 subsection 2. Nothing in this section requires the agency which
14 provides child welfare services to make a determination of law
15 regarding the documentation provided by the petitioner.
16 2. Upon receiving an ICWA compliance report, the court
17 shall order the matter to proceed if the court finds that the
18 petitioner satisfied the inquiry requirements under subsection 1 of
19 NRS 125E.210 and, if applicable, the notice requirements under
20 subsection 2 of NRS 125E.220. If the court finds that:
21 (a) Subject to the procedures under subsection 3 of NRS
22 125E.210, the child is an Indian child, the order by the court
23 under this subsection must include a finding regarding whether
24 the proposed adoptive placement complies with the preferences
25 under NRS 125E.350. If the court finds that the proposed adoptive
26 placement does not comply with such preferences or that the
27 documentation provided by the petitioner is insufficient for the
28 court to make a finding, the court shall direct the petitioner to
29 amend the petition to cure the deficiency or file a motion under
30 subsection 3 of NRS 125E.350, for authority to make the
31 placement contrary to the placement preferences under
32 NRS 125E.350.
33 (b) The petitioner failed to satisfy the inquiry requirements

31 or welfare of the child; or
32 (4) Abandoned the child for 60 or more days, and the identity
33 of the parent of the child is unknown and cannot be ascertained
34 through reasonable efforts;
35 (b) A parent of the child has, for the previous 6 months, had the
36 ability to contact or communicate with the child and made no more

15 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 179D of NRS or the provisions
16 of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006,

19 purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires,
20 “reasonable efforts” have been made if an agency which provides
21 child welfare services to children with legal custody of a child has

26 concerns. The exercise of such diligence and care includes, without
27 limitation, obtaining necessary and appropriate information

8 permanent placement of the child;
9 (i) Consider whether the provisions of subsection 6 are
10 applicable; and

14 section by taking no action concerning a child or making no effort to
15 provide services to a child if it is reasonable, under the
16 circumstances, to do so.
17 7. In determining whether reasonable efforts are not required
18 pursuant to subsection 3 or whether reasonable efforts have been
19 made pursuant to subsection 4, the court shall ensure that each
