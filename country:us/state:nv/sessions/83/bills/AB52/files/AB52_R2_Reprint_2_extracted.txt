AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of
health care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to
provide certain information to participating providers of
health care and covered persons; requiring a health carrier

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
2 and certain health insurers to approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the
3 insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim,
4 existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days
5 after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
6 information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law
7 requires the administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for
8 additional information within 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the
9 claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim after receiving such
10 additional information from the claimant, existing law requires the administrator or
11 insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such information. Existing

12 law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within the required
13 time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
14 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185,
15 695D.215, 695F.090)
16 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with
17 uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
18 insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
19 private health insurers in this State. Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
20 require each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the
21 claim is approved, pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving
22 the claim, if the claim is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving
23 the claim, if the claim is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and
24 16 require an administrator or insurer that needs additional information to
25 determine whether to approve or deny a claim to request such information within
26 20 working days after receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional
27 information, the administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14
28 and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within:
29 (1) twenty-one days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
30 information is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the
31 additional information, if the additional information is not submitted electronically.
32 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an administrator or insurer from denying a
33 claim without a reasonable basis for doing so. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
34 require an administrator or insurer to annually report to the Commissioner of
35 Insurance certain information relating to compliance with those requirements.
36 Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health maintenance
37 organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
38 provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including
39 health maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill
40 update references to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
41 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
42 penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
43 certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
44 existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
45 the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
46 second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
47 substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
48 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
49 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
50 issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
51 14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
52 administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
53 plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
54 claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
55 the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
56 second or subsequent such determination.
57 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
58 insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
59 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require
60 health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the
61 denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
62 determination concerning the claim if the information is submitted electronically, or
63 if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
64 necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also require the
65 inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
66 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply

67 to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for
68 dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the
69 payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers. Sections 2, 12.5, 17.5 and
70 18.5 of this bill exempt coverage under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance
71 Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the requirements of
72 sections 2, 8, 13, 16 and 18.
73 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
74 notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
75 responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
76 administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section
77 3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to provide to each
78 participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an
79 explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or
80 pay claims submitted by participating providers of health care. Section 3 exempts
81 coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health
82 Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from all such
83 notification requirements.
84 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
85 establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
86 participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
87 those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
88 of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 4
89 exempts coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s
90 Health Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the
91 requirement to establish such procedures. Section 1 of this bill requires the
92 Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry to establish and
93 carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions
94 of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
2 health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
3 providers of health care and improve access to health care for
4 residents of this State; and
5 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
6 create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
7 practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
8 State; and
9 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
10 disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
11 residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
12 health care services; now, therefore,

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 27, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT A.B. 52
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 52–COMMITTEE
ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
(ON BEHALF OF THE NEVADA COMMISSION
ON MINORITY AFFAIRS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance. (BDR 57-367)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of
health care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to
provide certain information to participating providers of
health care and covered persons; requiring a health carrier
to establish certain procedures for challenging the denial
of a claim; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
2 and certain health insurers to approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the
3 insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim,
4 existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days
5 after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
6 information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law
7 requires the administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for
8 additional information within 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the
9 claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim after receiving such
10 additional information from the claimant, existing law requires the administrator or
11 insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such information. Existing
-
*AB52_R2*

– 2 –
12 law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within the required
13 time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
14 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185,
15 695D.215, 695F.090)
16 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with
17 uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
18 insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
19 private health insurers in this State. Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
20 require each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the
21 claim is approved, pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving
22 the claim, if the claim is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving
23 the claim, if the claim is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and
24 16 require an administrator or insurer that needs additional information to
25 determine whether to approve or deny a claim to request such information within
26 20 working days after receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional
27 information, the administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14
28 and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within:
29 (1) twenty-one days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
30 information is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the
31 additional information, if the additional information is not submitted electronically.
32 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an administrator or insurer from denying a
33 claim without a reasonable basis for doing so. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
34 require an administrator or insurer to annually report to the Commissioner of
35 Insurance certain information relating to compliance with those requirements.
36 Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health maintenance
37 organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
38 provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including
39 health maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill
40 update references to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
41 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
42 penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
43 certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
44 existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
45 the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
46 second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
47 substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
48 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
49 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
50 issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
51 14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
52 administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
53 plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
54 claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
55 the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
56 second or subsequent such determination.
57 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
58 insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
59 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require
60 health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the
61 denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
62 determination concerning the claim if the information is submitted electronically, or
63 if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
64 necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also require the
65 inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
66 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply
-

67 to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for
68 dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the
69 payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers. Sections 2, 12.5, 17.5 and
70 18.5 of this bill exempt coverage under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance
71 Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the requirements of
72 sections 2, 8, 13, 16 and 18.
73 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
74 notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
75 responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
76 administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section
77 3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to provide to each
78 participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an
79 explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or
80 pay claims submitted by participating providers of health care. Section 3 exempts
81 coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health
82 Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from all such
83 notification requirements.
84 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
85 establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
86 participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
87 those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
88 of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 4
89 exempts coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s
90 Health Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the
91 requirement to establish such procedures. Section 1 of this bill requires the
92 Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry to establish and
93 carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions
94 of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
2 health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
3 providers of health care and improve access to health care for
4 residents of this State; and
5 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
6 create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
7 practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
8 State; and
9 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
10 disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
11 residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
12 health care services; now, therefore,
