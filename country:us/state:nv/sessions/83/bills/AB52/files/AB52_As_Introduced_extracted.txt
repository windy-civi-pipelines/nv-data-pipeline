AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of

health care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;

under policies of health insurance; establishing certain

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
2 and certain health insurers, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, to
3 approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the
4 administrator or insurer approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator
5 or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after the claim is approved. If the
6 administrator or insurer requires additional information to determine whether to
7 approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to
8 notify the claimant of its request for additional information within 20 days after the
-

– 2 –
9 administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves
10 the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing
11 law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after
12 receiving such information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that
13 fails to pay a claim within the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a
14 prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335,
15 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215, 695F.090)
16 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 of this bill replace those requirements
17 with uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
18 insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
19 public and private health insurers in this State, including Medicaid, insurance for
20 employees of local governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
21 Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 require each such administrator
22 or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the claim is approved, pay the claim
23 within: (1) fifteen working days after receiving the claim, if the claim is submitted
24 electronically; or (2) thirty working days after receiving the claim, if the claim is
25 not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 require an
26 administrator or insurer that needs additional information to determine whether to
27 approve or deny a claim to request such information within 20 working days after
28 receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional information, the
29 administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22
30 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within: (1)
31 fifteen working days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
32 information is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty working days after receiving
33 the additional information, if the additional information is not submitted
34 electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 require an administrator or
35 health insurer to annually report to the Commissioner of Insurance certain
36 information relating to compliance with those requirements. Section 25 of this bill
37 repeals certain provisions applicable to health maintenance organizations that are
38 no longer necessary because existing law makes the provisions of section 16
39 applicable to all managed care organizations, including health maintenance
40 organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references to
41 a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
42 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
43 penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
44 certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
45 existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
46 the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
47 second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
48 substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
49 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
50 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
51 issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
52 14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
53 administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
54 plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
55 claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
56 the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
57 second or subsequent such determination. Section 19 of this bill makes a
58 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human
59 Services to administer the provisions of section 22 in the same manner as other
60 provisions governing Medicaid.
61 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
62 insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
63 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 and 22 of this
-
*AB52*
– 3 –
64 bill require all public and private health insurers and administrators of health
65 insurance plans to provide notice of the denial of a claim within 30 working days
66 after receiving all information necessary to make a determination concerning the
67 claim. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 and 22 of this bill also require
68 the inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and
69 16 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently
70 apply to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations
71 for dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing
72 the payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers.
73 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
74 notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
75 responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
76 administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730)
77 Sections 3 and 22 of this bill additionally require such a health carrier or the
78 Medicaid Program to provide to each participating provider of health care and each
79 covered person at least annually an explanation of the process by which the health
80 carrier or Medicaid, as applicable, will provide remittances to or pay claims
81 submitted by participating providers of health care.
82 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
83 establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
84 participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
85 those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
86 of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 22
87 imposes a similar requirement on the Medicaid program. Sections 20 and 21 of this
88 bill make the provisions of sections 3 and 4 applicable to local governments that
89 provide health insurance for their employees and the Public Employees’ Benefits
90 Program, respectively. Section 1 of this bill requires the Division of Insurance of
91 the Department of Business and Industry to establish and carry out certain
92 programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
2 health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
3 providers of health care and improve access to health care for
4 residents of this State; and
5 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
6 create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
7 practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
8 State; and
9 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
10 disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
11 residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
12 health care services; now, therefore,

A.B. 52
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 52–COMMITTEE
ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
(ON BEHALF OF THE NEVADA COMMISSION
ON MINORITY AFFAIRS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance. (BDR 57-367)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 20)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of
health care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to
provide certain information to participating providers of
health care and covered persons; requiring a health carrier
to establish certain procedures for challenging the denial
of a claim; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
2 and certain health insurers, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, to
3 approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the
4 administrator or insurer approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator
5 or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after the claim is approved. If the
6 administrator or insurer requires additional information to determine whether to
7 approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to
8 notify the claimant of its request for additional information within 20 days after the
-
*AB52*

– 2 –
9 administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves
10 the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing
11 law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after
12 receiving such information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that
13 fails to pay a claim within the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a
14 prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335,
15 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215, 695F.090)
16 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 of this bill replace those requirements
17 with uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
18 insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
19 public and private health insurers in this State, including Medicaid, insurance for
20 employees of local governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
21 Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 require each such administrator
22 or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the claim is approved, pay the claim
23 within: (1) fifteen working days after receiving the claim, if the claim is submitted
24 electronically; or (2) thirty working days after receiving the claim, if the claim is
25 not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 require an
26 administrator or insurer that needs additional information to determine whether to
27 approve or deny a claim to request such information within 20 working days after
28 receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional information, the
29 administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22
30 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within: (1)
31 fifteen working days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
32 information is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty working days after receiving
33 the additional information, if the additional information is not submitted
34 electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14, 16, 20 and 22 require an administrator or
35 health insurer to annually report to the Commissioner of Insurance certain
36 information relating to compliance with those requirements. Section 25 of this bill
37 repeals certain provisions applicable to health maintenance organizations that are
38 no longer necessary because existing law makes the provisions of section 16
39 applicable to all managed care organizations, including health maintenance
40 organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references to
41 a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
42 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
43 penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
44 certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
45 existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
46 the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
47 second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
48 substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
49 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
50 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
51 issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
52 14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
53 administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
54 plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
55 claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
56 the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
57 second or subsequent such determination. Section 19 of this bill makes a
58 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human
59 Services to administer the provisions of section 22 in the same manner as other
60 provisions governing Medicaid.
61 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
62 insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
63 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 and 22 of this
-
*AB52*

– 3 –
64 bill require all public and private health insurers and administrators of health
65 insurance plans to provide notice of the denial of a claim within 30 working days
66 after receiving all information necessary to make a determination concerning the
67 claim. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 and 22 of this bill also require
68 the inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and
69 16 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently
70 apply to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations
71 for dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing
72 the payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers.
73 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
74 notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
75 responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
76 administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730)
77 Sections 3 and 22 of this bill additionally require such a health carrier or the
78 Medicaid Program to provide to each participating provider of health care and each
79 covered person at least annually an explanation of the process by which the health
80 carrier or Medicaid, as applicable, will provide remittances to or pay claims
81 submitted by participating providers of health care.
82 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
83 establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
84 participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
85 those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
86 of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 22
87 imposes a similar requirement on the Medicaid program. Sections 20 and 21 of this
88 bill make the provisions of sections 3 and 4 applicable to local governments that
89 provide health insurance for their employees and the Public Employees’ Benefits
90 Program, respectively. Section 1 of this bill requires the Division of Insurance of
91 the Department of Business and Industry to establish and carry out certain
92 programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
2 health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
3 providers of health care and improve access to health care for
4 residents of this State; and
5 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
6 create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
7 practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
8 State; and
9 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
10 disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
11 residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
12 health care services; now, therefore,

of administrative fine or suspension or revocation of certificate
of authority for failure to comply.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 and NRS
439B.754, a health maintenance organization shall approve or deny
a claim relating to a health care plan within 30 days after the health
maintenance organization receives the claim. If the claim is
approved, the health maintenance organization shall pay the claim
within 30 days after it is approved. Except as otherwise provided in
this section, if the approved claim is not paid within that period, the
health maintenance organization shall pay interest on the claim at a
rate of interest equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada,
as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on
January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the
-

– 33 –
date on which the payment was due, plus 6 percent. The interest
must be calculated from 30 days after the date on which the claim is
approved until the date on which the claim is paid.
2. If the health maintenance organization requires additional
information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, it
shall notify the claimant of its request for the additional information
within 20 days after it receives the claim. The health maintenance
organization shall notify the provider of health care services of all
the specific reasons for the delay in approving or denying the claim.
The health maintenance organization shall approve or deny the
claim within 30 days after receiving the additional information. If
the claim is approved, the health maintenance organization shall pay
the claim within 30 days after it receives the additional information.
If the approved claim is not paid within that period, the health
maintenance organization shall pay interest on the claim in the
manner prescribed in subsection 1.
3. A health maintenance organization shall not request a
claimant to resubmit information that the claimant has already
provided to the health maintenance organization, unless the health
maintenance organization provides a legitimate reason for the
request and the purpose of the request is not to delay the payment of
the claim, harass the claimant or discourage the filing of claims.
4. A health maintenance organization shall not pay only part of
a claim that has been approved and is fully payable.
5. A court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to
the prevailing party in an action brought pursuant to this section.
6. The payment of interest provided for in this section for the
late payment of an approved claim may be waived only if the
payment was delayed because of an act of God or another cause
beyond the control of the health maintenance organization.
7. The Commissioner may require a health maintenance
organization to provide evidence which demonstrates that the health
maintenance organization has substantially complied with the
requirements set forth in this section, including, without limitation,
payment within 30 days of at least 95 percent of approved claims or
at least 90 percent of the total dollar amount for approved claims.
8. If the Commissioner determines that a health maintenance
organization is not in substantial compliance with the requirements
set forth in this section, the Commissioner may require the health
maintenance organization to pay an administrative fine in an amount
to be determined by the Commissioner. Upon a second or
subsequent determination that a health maintenance organization is
not in substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in this

section, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the certificate of
authority of the health maintenance organization.
