AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of
health care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to
provide certain information to participating providers of
health care and covered persons; requiring a health carrier
to establish certain procedures for challenging the denial
of a claim; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
2 and certain health insurers, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, to
3 approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the
4 administrator or insurer approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator
5 or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after the claim is approved. If the
6 administrator or insurer requires additional information to determine whether to
7 approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to
8 notify the claimant of its request for additional information within 20 days after the
9 administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves
10 the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing
11 law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after
-
*AB52_R1*
– 2 –
12 receiving such information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that
13 fails to pay a claim within the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a
14 prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335,
15 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215, 695F.090)
16 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with
17 uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
18 insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
19 private health insurers in this State and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
20 Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require each such administrator or
21 insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the claim is approved, pay the claim
22 within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving the claim, if the claim is submitted
23 electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the claim, if the claim is not
24 submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or
25 insurer that needs additional information to determine whether to approve or deny a
26 claim to request such information within 20 working days after receiving the claim.
27 If, after receiving such additional information, the administrator or insurer approves
28 the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as
29 applicable, to pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving the
30 additional information, if the additional information is submitted electronically; or
31 (2) thirty days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
32 information is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit
33 an administrator or insurer from denying a claim without a reasonable basis for
34 doing so. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or insurer to
35 annually report to the Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to
36 compliance with those requirements. Section 25 of this bill repeals certain
37 provisions applicable to health maintenance organizations that are no longer
38 necessary because existing law makes the provisions of section 16 applicable to all
39 managed care organizations, including health maintenance organizations. (NRS
40 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references to a section repealed
41 by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
42 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
43 penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
44 certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
45 existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
46 the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
47 second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
48 substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
49 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
50 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
51 issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
52 14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
53 administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
54 plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
55 claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
56 the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
57 second or subsequent such determination.
58 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
59 insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
60 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require
61 health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the
62 denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
63 determination concerning the claim if the information is submitted electronically, or
64 if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
65 necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also require the
66 inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
-
*AB52_R1*
– 3 –
67 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply
68 to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for
69 dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the
70 payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers.
71 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
72 notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
73 responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
74 administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section
75 3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to provide to each
76 participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an
77 explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or
78 pay claims submitted by participating providers of health care.
79 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
80 establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
81 participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
82 those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
83 of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 1 of
84 this bill requires the Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and
85 Industry to establish and carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge
86 and use of the provisions of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
2 health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
3 providers of health care and improve access to health care for
4 residents of this State; and
5 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
6 create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
7 practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
8 State; and
9 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
10 disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
11 residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
12 health care services; now, therefore,

ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
(ON BEHALF OF THE NEVADA COMMISSION
ON MINORITY AFFAIRS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance. (BDR 57-367)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of
health care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims
under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to
provide certain information to participating providers of
health care and covered persons; requiring a health carrier
to establish certain procedures for challenging the denial
of a claim; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
2 and certain health insurers, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, to
3 approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the
4 administrator or insurer approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator
5 or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after the claim is approved. If the
6 administrator or insurer requires additional information to determine whether to
7 approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to
8 notify the claimant of its request for additional information within 20 days after the
9 administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves
10 the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing
11 law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after
-
*AB52_R1*

– 2 –
12 receiving such information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that
13 fails to pay a claim within the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a
14 prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335,
15 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215, 695F.090)
16 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with
17 uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
18 insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
19 private health insurers in this State and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
20 Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require each such administrator or
21 insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the claim is approved, pay the claim
22 within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving the claim, if the claim is submitted
23 electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the claim, if the claim is not
24 submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or
25 insurer that needs additional information to determine whether to approve or deny a
26 claim to request such information within 20 working days after receiving the claim.
27 If, after receiving such additional information, the administrator or insurer approves
28 the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as
29 applicable, to pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving the
30 additional information, if the additional information is submitted electronically; or
31 (2) thirty days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
32 information is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit
33 an administrator or insurer from denying a claim without a reasonable basis for
34 doing so. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or insurer to
35 annually report to the Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to
36 compliance with those requirements. Section 25 of this bill repeals certain
37 provisions applicable to health maintenance organizations that are no longer
38 necessary because existing law makes the provisions of section 16 applicable to all
39 managed care organizations, including health maintenance organizations. (NRS
40 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references to a section repealed
41 by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
42 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
43 penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
44 certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
45 existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
46 the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
47 second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
48 substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
49 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
50 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
51 issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
52 14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
53 administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
54 plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
55 claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
56 the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
57 second or subsequent such determination.
58 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
59 insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
60 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require
61 health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the
62 denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
63 determination concerning the claim if the information is submitted electronically, or
64 if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
65 necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also require the
66 inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
-
*AB52_R1*

– 3 –
67 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply
68 to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for
69 dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the
70 payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers.
71 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
72 notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
73 responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
74 administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section
75 3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to provide to each
76 participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an
77 explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or
78 pay claims submitted by participating providers of health care.
79 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
80 establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
81 participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
82 those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
83 of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 1 of
84 this bill requires the Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and
85 Industry to establish and carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge
86 and use of the provisions of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
2 health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
3 providers of health care and improve access to health care for
4 residents of this State; and
5 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
6 create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
7 practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
8 State; and
9 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
10 disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
11 residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
12 health care services; now, therefore,
13
14 THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
15 SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
16
17 Section 1. NRS 679B.550 is hereby amended to read as

16 practices or are new to operating a health care practice in:
17 (1) Navigating the process for seeking reimbursement from
18 insurers; and
19 (2) Ensuring that insurers comply with the requirements of
20 NRS 683A.0879, 687B.730, 687B.820, 689A.410, 689A.755,
21 689B.0295, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695B.400,
22 695D.215 and 695G.230 and sections 15 and 16 of this act; and
23 7. Take such actions as are necessary to ensure public
24 awareness of the existence and purpose of the services provided by
25 the Division pursuant to this section.
26 Sec. 2. NRS 683A.0879 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 683A.0879 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [2]
28 3 and NRS 439B.754, an administrator shall approve or deny a
29 claim relating to health insurance coverage and, if the
30 administrator:
31 (a) Approves the claim, pay the claim within [30] :
32 (1) Twenty-one days after the administrator receives the
33 claim [. If the claim is approved, the administrator shall pay the
34 claim within 30 days after it is approved.] , if the claim is submitted
35 electronically; or
36 (2) Thirty days after the administrator receives the claim, if
37 the claim is not submitted electronically.
38 (b) Denies the claim, notify the claimant in writing of the
39 denial within 21 days after the administrator receives the claim, if
40 the claim is submitted electronically, or 30 days after the
41 administrator receives the claim, if the claim is not submitted
42 electronically. The notice must include, without limitation:
43 (1) All reasons for denying the claim, including, without
44 limitation, the specific facts and provisions of the policy relied
45 upon by the administrator as a basis to deny the claim;

*AB52_R1*

– 5 –

2 whether to approve or deny the claim and a description of the
3 manner in which the administrator applied those criteria to the
4 claim; and
5 (3) A summary of any applicable process established
6 pursuant to NRS 687B.820 for challenging the denial of the claim.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the approved
8 claim is not paid within [that] the period [,] specified in subsection
9 1, the administrator shall pay interest on the claim at a rate of
10 [interest equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as
11 ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on
12 January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the
13 date on which the payment was due, plus 6] 10 percent [.] per
14 annum. The interest must be calculated from [30 days after] the
15 date on which payment of the claim is [approved] due pursuant to
16 subsection 1 until the date on which the claim is paid.
17 [2.] 3. If the administrator requires additional information to
18 determine whether to approve or deny the claim, the administrator
19 shall notify the claimant of the administrator’s request for the
20 additional information within 20 working days after receiving the

-
*AB52_R1*

– 6 –
1 provides a legitimate reason for the request and the purpose of the
2 request is not to delay the payment of the claim, harass the claimant
3 or discourage the filing of claims.
4 [4.] 6. An administrator shall not pay only part of a claim that
5 has been approved and is fully payable.
6 [5.] 7. A court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees
7 to the prevailing party in an action brought pursuant to this section.
8 [6.] 8. The payment of interest provided for in this section for

11 beyond the control of the administrator.
12 [7.] 9. The Commissioner may require an administrator to
13 provide evidence which demonstrates that the administrator has
14 substantially complied with the requirements set forth in this
15 section, including, without limitation, payment within [30 days] the
16 time periods specified by this section of at least 95 percent of
17 approved claims or at least 90 percent of the total dollar amount for

19 [8.] 10. If the Commissioner determines that an administrator
20 is not in substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in
21 this section [,] or has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an
22 approved claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim,
23 the Commissioner may require the administrator to pay an
24 administrative fine in an amount to be determined by the
25 Commissioner. Upon a second or subsequent determination that an
26 administrator is not in substantial compliance with the requirements
27 set forth in this section [,] or has failed to approve or deny a claim
28 or pay an approved claim within 60 working days after receiving
29 the claim, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the certificate
30 of registration of the administrator.
31 11. On or before February 1 of each year, an administrator
32 that was responsible for the approval and denial of claims relating

1 Sec. 3. NRS 687B.730 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 687B.730 A health carrier which offers or issues a network
3 plan shall [notify] :
4 1. Notify each participating provider of health care in the
5 network of the responsibilities of the participating provider of health
6 care with respect to any applicable administrative policies and
7 programs of the health carrier including, without limitation, any
8 applicable administrative policies and programs concerning:

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 and NRS
439B.754, a health maintenance organization shall approve or deny
a claim relating to a health care plan within 30 days after the health
maintenance organization receives the claim. If the claim is
approved, the health maintenance organization shall pay the claim
within 30 days after it is approved. Except as otherwise provided in
this section, if the approved claim is not paid within that period, the
health maintenance organization shall pay interest on the claim at a
rate of interest equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada,
as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on
January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the
date on which the payment was due, plus 6 percent. The interest
must be calculated from 30 days after the date on which the claim is
approved until the date on which the claim is paid.
2. If the health maintenance organization requires additional
information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, it

– 29 –
shall notify the claimant of its request for the additional information
within 20 days after it receives the claim. The health maintenance
organization shall notify the provider of health care services of all
the specific reasons for the delay in approving or denying the claim.
The health maintenance organization shall approve or deny the
claim within 30 days after receiving the additional information. If
the claim is approved, the health maintenance organization shall pay
the claim within 30 days after it receives the additional information.
If the approved claim is not paid within that period, the health
maintenance organization shall pay interest on the claim in the
manner prescribed in subsection 1.
3. A health maintenance organization shall not request a
claimant to resubmit information that the claimant has already
provided to the health maintenance organization, unless the health
maintenance organization provides a legitimate reason for the
request and the purpose of the request is not to delay the payment of
the claim, harass the claimant or discourage the filing of claims.
4. A health maintenance organization shall not pay only part of
a claim that has been approved and is fully payable.
5. A court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to
the prevailing party in an action brought pursuant to this section.
6. The payment of interest provided for in this section for the
late payment of an approved claim may be waived only if the
payment was delayed because of an act of God or another cause
beyond the control of the health maintenance organization.
7. The Commissioner may require a health maintenance
organization to provide evidence which demonstrates that the health
maintenance organization has substantially complied with the
requirements set forth in this section, including, without limitation,
payment within 30 days of at least 95 percent of approved claims or
at least 90 percent of the total dollar amount for approved claims.
8. If the Commissioner determines that a health maintenance
organization is not in substantial compliance with the requirements
set forth in this section, the Commissioner may require the health
maintenance organization to pay an administrative fine in an amount
to be determined by the Commissioner. Upon a second or
subsequent determination that a health maintenance organization is
not in substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in this
section, the Commissioner may suspend or revoke the certificate of
authority of the health maintenance organization.
