EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of Insurance to
establish programs to inform providers of health care and insureds
under health insurance policies of certain information relating to the
payment of claims; revising provisions governing the payment of
claims under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to provide certain
information to participating providers of health care and covered
persons; requiring a health carrier to establish certain procedures for
challenging the denial of a claim; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans and
2 certain health insurers, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, to approve or deny
3 a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer
4 approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within
5 30 days after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
6 information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the
7 administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for additional information within
8 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer
9 approves the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing law
10 requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such
11 information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within
12 the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
13 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215,
14 695F.090)

Assembly Amendment No. 235 to Assembly Bill No. 52 Page 4
15 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 [,] and 16 [, 20 and 22] of this bill replace those requirements with
16 uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health insurance claims
17 that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all [public and] private health
18 insurers in this State [, including Medicaid, insurance for employees of local governments]
19 and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 [,] and 16 [,
20 20 and 22] require each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the
21 claim is approved, pay the claim within: (1) [fifteen working] twenty-one days after receiving
22 the claim, if the claim is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty [working] days after receiving
23 the claim, if the claim is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 [,] and 16 [, 20
24 and 22] require an administrator or insurer that needs additional information to determine
25 whether to approve or deny a claim to request such information within 20 working days after
26 receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional information, the administrator or insurer
27 approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 [,] and 16 [, 20 and 22] require the administrator or
28 insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within: (1) [fifteen working] twenty-one days after
29 receiving the additional information, if the additional information is submitted electronically;
30 or (2) thirty [working] days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
31 information is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an
32 administrator or insurer from denying a claim without a reasonable basis for doing so.
33 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 [,] and 16 [, 20 and 22] require an administrator or [health] insurer to
34 annually report to the Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to compliance
35 with those requirements. Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health
36 maintenance organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
37 provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including health
38 maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references
39 to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
40 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative penalty upon
41 determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or certain health insurers are not
42 in substantial compliance with the provisions of existing law governing the schedule for
43 paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke the certificate of registration or authority of such an
44 administrator or insurer upon a second or subsequent determination that such an administrator
45 or insurer is not in substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335,
46 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10,
47 14 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies, issuers of
48 plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
49 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative penalty upon
50 determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or a health insurer has failed to
51 approve or deny a claim or pay an approved claim within 60 working days after receiving the
52 claim; and (2) suspend or revoke the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator
53 or insurer upon a second or subsequent such determination. [Section 19 of this bill makes a
54 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
55 to administer the provisions of section 22 in the same manner as other provisions governing
56 Medicaid.]
57 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an insured within
58 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295, 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections
59 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 [, 17,] and 18 [, 20 and 22] of this bill require [all public and private]
60 health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the denial of a
61 claim within [30 working days] 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
62 determination concerning the claim [.] if the information is submitted electronically, or if
63 the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
64 necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 [, 17,] and 18 [, 20 and 22 of this
65 bill] also require the inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10,
66 14 and 16 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply
67 to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for dental care
68 and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the payment of claims are
69 uniform for all health insurers.
70 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to notify each
71 participating provider of health care in the network of the responsibilities of the provider of
72 health care with respect to any applicable administrative policies and programs of the health
73 carrier. (NRS 687B.730) [Sections] Section 3 [and 22] of this bill additionally [require]

Assembly Amendment No. 235 to Assembly Bill No. 52 Page 5
74 requires such a health carrier [or the Medicaid Program] to provide to each participating
75 provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an explanation of the process
76 by which the health carrier [or Medicaid, as applicable,] will provide remittances to or pay
77 claims submitted by participating providers of health care.
78 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to establish
79 procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a participating
80 provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires those procedures to
81 include an efficient process by which a participating provider of health care may challenge the
82 denial by a health carrier of a claim. [Section 22 imposes a similar requirement on the
83 Medicaid program. Sections 20 and 21 of this bill make the provisions of sections 3 and 4
84 applicable to local governments that provide health insurance for their employees and the
85 Public Employees’ Benefits Program, respectively.] Section 1 of this bill requires the Division
86 of Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry to establish and carry out certain
87 programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of health care will
2 enhance the business environment in this State for providers of health care and
3 improve access to health care for residents of this State; and
4 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will create a more
5 stable and attractive landscape for new medical practices, thereby improving the
6 health care infrastructure of this State; and
7 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a disproportionate negative
8 effect on minority communities, whose residents are less likely to have the means
9 to pay out of pocket for health care services; now, therefore,
10

Assembly Amendment No. 235 to Assembly Bill No. 52 Page 28
695C.185 Approval or denial of claims; payment of claims and interest;
requests for additional information; award of costs and attorney’s fees;
compliance with requirements; imposition of administrative fine or suspension
or revocation of certificate of authority for failure to comply.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 and NRS 439B.754, a health
maintenance organization shall approve or deny a claim relating to a health care
plan within 30 days after the health maintenance organization receives the claim. If
the claim is approved, the health maintenance organization shall pay the claim
within 30 days after it is approved. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if
the approved claim is not paid within that period, the health maintenance
organization shall pay interest on the claim at a rate of interest equal to the prime
rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions, on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the
date on which the payment was due, plus 6 percent. The interest must be calculated
from 30 days after the date on which the claim is approved until the date on which
the claim is paid.
2. If the health maintenance organization requires additional information to
determine whether to approve or deny the claim, it shall notify the claimant of its
request for the additional information within 20 days after it receives the claim. The
health maintenance organization shall notify the provider of health care services of

health maintenance organization shall pay interest on the claim in the manner
prescribed in subsection 1.
3. A health maintenance organization shall not request a claimant to resubmit
information that the claimant has already provided to the health maintenance
organization, unless the health maintenance organization provides a legitimate
reason for the request and the purpose of the request is not to delay the payment of
the claim, harass the claimant or discourage the filing of claims.
4. A health maintenance organization shall not pay only part of a claim that
has been approved and is fully payable.
5. A court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing
party in an action brought pursuant to this section.
6. The payment of interest provided for in this section for the late payment of
an approved claim may be waived only if the payment was delayed because of an
act of God or another cause beyond the control of the health maintenance
organization.
7. The Commissioner may require a health maintenance organization to
provide evidence which demonstrates that the health maintenance organization has
substantially complied with the requirements set forth in this section, including,
without limitation, payment within 30 days of at least 95 percent of approved
claims or at least 90 percent of the total dollar amount for approved claims.
8. If the Commissioner determines that a health maintenance organization is
not in substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in this section, the
Commissioner may require the health maintenance organization to pay an
administrative fine in an amount to be determined by the Commissioner. Upon a
second or subsequent determination that a health maintenance organization is not in
substantial compliance with the requirements set forth in this section, the
