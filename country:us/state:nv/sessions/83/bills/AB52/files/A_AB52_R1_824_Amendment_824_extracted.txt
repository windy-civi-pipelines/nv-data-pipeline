AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of Insurance to
establish programs to inform providers of health care and insureds
under health insurance policies of certain information relating to the
payment of claims; revising provisions governing the payment of
claims under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to provide certain
information to participating providers of health care and covered
persons; requiring a health carrier to establish certain procedures for
challenging the denial of a claim; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans and
2 certain health insurers [, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,] to approve or
3 deny a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer
4 approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within
5 30 days after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
6 information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the
7 administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for additional information within
8 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer
9 approves the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing law
10 requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such
11 information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within
12 the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
13 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215,
14 695F.090)
15 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with uniform
16 requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health insurance claims that apply
17 to administrators of health insurance plans and all private health insurers in this State . [and
Assembly Amendment No. 824 to Assembly Bill No. 52 First Reprint Page 4
18 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.] Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require
19 each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the claim is approved,
20 pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving the claim, if the claim is submitted
21 electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the claim, if the claim is not submitted
22 electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or insurer that needs
23 additional information to determine whether to approve or deny a claim to request such
24 information within 20 working days after receiving the claim. If, after receiving such
25 additional information, the administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14
26 and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within: (1) twenty-
27 one days after receiving the additional information, if the additional information is submitted
28 electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
29 information is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an
30 administrator or insurer from denying a claim without a reasonable basis for doing so.
31 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or insurer to annually report to the
32 Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to compliance with those
33 requirements. Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health
34 maintenance organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
35 provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including health
36 maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references
37 to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
38 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative penalty upon
39 determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or certain health insurers are not
40 in substantial compliance with the provisions of existing law governing the schedule for
41 paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke the certificate of registration or authority of such an
42 administrator or insurer upon a second or subsequent determination that such an administrator
43 or insurer is not in substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335,
44 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10,
45 14 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies, issuers of
46 plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
47 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative penalty upon
48 determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or a health insurer has failed to
49 approve or deny a claim or pay an approved claim within 60 working days after receiving the
50 claim; and (2) suspend or revoke the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator
51 or insurer upon a second or subsequent such determination.
52 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an insured within
53 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295, 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections
54 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require health insurers and administrators of health
55 insurance plans to provide notice of the denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all
56 information necessary to make a determination concerning the claim if the information is
57 submitted electronically, or if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days
58 after receiving the necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also
59 require the inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
60 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply to most
61 health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for dental care and
62 managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the payment of claims are
63 uniform for all health insurers. Sections 2, 12.5, 17.5 and 18.5 of this bill exempt coverage
64 under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Public Employees’
65 Benefits Program from the requirements of sections 2, 8, 13, 16 and 18.
66 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to notify each
67 participating provider of health care in the network of the responsibilities of the provider of
68 health care with respect to any applicable administrative policies and programs of the health
69 carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section 3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to
70 provide to each participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually
71 an explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or pay
72 claims submitted by participating providers of health care. Section 3 exempts coverage by
73 managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program
74 and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from all such notification requirements.
75 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to establish
76 procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a participating
Assembly Amendment No. 824 to Assembly Bill No. 52 First Reprint Page 5
77 provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires those procedures to
78 include an efficient process by which a participating provider of health care may challenge the
79 denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 4 exempts coverage by managed care
80 organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Public
81 Employees’ Benefits Program from the requirement to establish such procedures.
82 Section 1 of this bill requires the Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and
83 Industry to establish and carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of
84 the provisions of this bill.
1 WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of health care will
2 enhance the business environment in this State for providers of health care and
3 improve access to health care for residents of this State; and
4 WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will create a more
5 stable and attractive landscape for new medical practices, thereby improving the
6 health care infrastructure of this State; and
7 WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a disproportionate negative
8 effect on minority communities, whose residents are less likely to have the means
9 to pay out of pocket for health care services; now, therefore,

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of Insurance to
establish programs to inform providers of health care and insureds
under health insurance policies of certain information relating to the
payment of claims; revising provisions governing the payment of
claims under policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to provide certain
information to participating providers of health care and covered
persons; requiring a health carrier to establish certain procedures for
challenging the denial of a claim; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans and
2 certain health insurers [, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,] to approve or
3 deny a claim within 30 days after the insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer
4 approves the claim, existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within
5 30 days after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
6 information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law requires the
7 administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for additional information within
8 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer
9 approves the claim after receiving such additional information from the claimant, existing law
10 requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such
11 information. Existing law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within
12 the required time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
13 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215,
14 695F.090)
15 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with uniform
16 requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health insurance claims that apply
17 to administrators of health insurance plans and all private health insurers in this State . [and

Assembly Amendment No. 824 to Assembly Bill No. 52 First Reprint Page 4
18 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.] Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require
19 each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the claim is approved,
20 pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving the claim, if the claim is submitted
21 electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the claim, if the claim is not submitted
22 electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or insurer that needs
23 additional information to determine whether to approve or deny a claim to request such
24 information within 20 working days after receiving the claim. If, after receiving such
25 additional information, the administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14
26 and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within: (1) twenty-
27 one days after receiving the additional information, if the additional information is submitted
28 electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
29 information is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an
30 administrator or insurer from denying a claim without a reasonable basis for doing so.
31 Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 require an administrator or insurer to annually report to the
32 Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to compliance with those
33 requirements. Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health
34 maintenance organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
35 provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including health
36 maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill update references
37 to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
38 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative penalty upon
39 determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or certain health insurers are not
40 in substantial compliance with the provisions of existing law governing the schedule for
41 paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke the certificate of registration or authority of such an
42 administrator or insurer upon a second or subsequent determination that such an administrator
43 or insurer is not in substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335,
44 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10,
45 14 and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies, issuers of
46 plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
47 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative penalty upon
48 determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or a health insurer has failed to
49 approve or deny a claim or pay an approved claim within 60 working days after receiving the
50 claim; and (2) suspend or revoke the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator
51 or insurer upon a second or subsequent such determination.
52 Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an insured within
53 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295, 695B.400, 695G.230) Sections
54 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require health insurers and administrators of health
55 insurance plans to provide notice of the denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all
56 information necessary to make a determination concerning the claim if the information is
57 submitted electronically, or if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days
58 after receiving the necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also
59 require the inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
60 make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply to most
61 health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for dental care and
62 managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the payment of claims are
63 uniform for all health insurers. Sections 2, 12.5, 17.5 and 18.5 of this bill exempt coverage
64 under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Public Employees’
65 Benefits Program from the requirements of sections 2, 8, 13, 16 and 18.
66 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to notify each
67 participating provider of health care in the network of the responsibilities of the provider of
68 health care with respect to any applicable administrative policies and programs of the health
69 carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section 3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to
70 provide to each participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually
71 an explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or pay
72 claims submitted by participating providers of health care. Section 3 exempts coverage by
73 managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program
74 and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from all such notification requirements.
75 Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to establish
76 procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a participating
