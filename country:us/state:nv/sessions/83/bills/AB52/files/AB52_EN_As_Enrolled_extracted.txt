CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of health
care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims under
policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to provide
certain information to participating providers of health care
and covered persons; requiring a health carrier to establish
certain procedures for challenging the denial of a claim; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
and certain health insurers to approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the
insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim,
existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days
after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law
requires the administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for
additional information within 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the
claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim after receiving such
additional information from the claimant, existing law requires the administrator or
insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such information. Existing
law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within the required
time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185,
695D.215, 695F.090)

Section 2:
Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with
uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
private health insurers in this State. Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
require each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the
claim is approved, pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving
the claim, if the claim is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving
the claim, if the claim is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and
16 require an administrator or insurer that needs additional information to
determine whether to approve or deny a claim to request such information within
20 working days after receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional
information, the administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14
and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within:
(1) twenty-one days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
information is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the
additional information, if the additional information is not submitted electronically.

Section 3:
Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an administrator or insurer from denying a
claim without a reasonable basis for doing so. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
require an administrator or insurer to annually report to the Commissioner of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
Insurance certain information relating to compliance with those requirements.

Section 4:
Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health maintenance
organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including
health maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill
update references to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
second or subsequent such determination.
Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require
health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the
denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
determination concerning the claim if the information is submitted electronically, or
if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also require the
inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply
to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for
dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the
payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers. Sections 2, 12.5, 17.5 and

Section 5:
18.5 of this bill exempt coverage under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance
Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the requirements of

Section 6:
sections 2, 8, 13, 16 and 18.
Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section
3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to provide to each
participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an
explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or
pay claims submitted by participating providers of health care. Section 3 exempts
coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health
Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from all such
notification requirements.
Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 4
exempts coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s
Health Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the
requirement to establish such procedures. Section 1 of this bill requires the
Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry to establish and
carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions
of this bill.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 52–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish programs to inform providers of health
care and insureds under health insurance policies
of certain information relating to the payment of claims;
revising provisions governing the payment of claims under
policies of health insurance; establishing certain
administrative penalties; requiring a health carrier to provide
certain information to participating providers of health care
and covered persons; requiring a health carrier to establish
certain procedures for challenging the denial of a claim; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In most cases, existing law requires the administrators of health insurance plans
and certain health insurers to approve or deny a claim within 30 days after the
insurer receives the claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim,
existing law requires the administrator or insurer to pay the claim within 30 days
after the claim is approved. If the administrator or insurer requires additional
information to determine whether to approve or deny the claim, existing law
requires the administrator or insurer to notify the claimant of its request for
additional information within 20 days after the administrator or insurer receives the
claim. If the administrator or insurer approves the claim after receiving such
additional information from the claimant, existing law requires the administrator or
insurer to pay the claim within 30 days after receiving such information. Existing
law requires an administrator or insurer that fails to pay a claim within the required
time period to pay interest on the claim at a prescribed rate. (NRS 287.04335,
683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185,
695D.215, 695F.090)
Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 of this bill replace those requirements with
uniform requirements governing the time periods for the payment of health
insurance claims that apply to administrators of health insurance plans and all
private health insurers in this State. Specifically, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
require each such administrator or insurer to approve or deny a claim and, if the
claim is approved, pay the claim within: (1) twenty-one days after receiving
the claim, if the claim is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving
the claim, if the claim is not submitted electronically. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and
16 require an administrator or insurer that needs additional information to
determine whether to approve or deny a claim to request such information within
20 working days after receiving the claim. If, after receiving such additional
information, the administrator or insurer approves the claim, sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14
and 16 require the administrator or insurer, as applicable, to pay the claim within:
(1) twenty-one days after receiving the additional information, if the additional
information is submitted electronically; or (2) thirty days after receiving the
additional information, if the additional information is not submitted electronically.
Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16 prohibit an administrator or insurer from denying a
claim without a reasonable basis for doing so. Sections 2, 5, 8-11, 14 and 16
require an administrator or insurer to annually report to the Commissioner of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Insurance certain information relating to compliance with those requirements.
Section 25 of this bill repeals certain provisions applicable to health maintenance
organizations that are no longer necessary because existing law makes the
provisions of section 16 applicable to all managed care organizations, including
health maintenance organizations. (NRS 695C.055) Sections 13 and 18 of this bill
update references to a section repealed by section 25 with a reference to section 16.
Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) impose an administrative
penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance plan or
certain health insurers are not in substantial compliance with the provisions of
existing law governing the schedule for paying claims; and (2) suspend or revoke
the certificate of registration or authority of such an administrator or insurer upon a
second or subsequent determination that such an administrator or insurer is not in
substantial compliance with those provisions. (NRS 287.04335, 683A.0879,
689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.335, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695F.090) Sections 10, 14
and 16 of this bill extend those penalties to apply to fraternal benefit societies,
issuers of plans for dental care and managed care organizations. Sections 2, 5, 8-11,
14 and 16 additionally authorize the Commissioner to: (1) impose an
administrative penalty upon determining that the administrator of a health insurance
plan or a health insurer has failed to approve or deny a claim or pay an approved
claim within 60 working days after receiving the claim; and (2) suspend or revoke
the certificate of registration or authority of an administrator or insurer upon a
second or subsequent such determination.
Existing law requires certain health insurers to provide certain notice to an
insured within 10 days after denying coverage. (NRS 689A.755, 689B.0295,
695B.400, 695G.230) Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 of this bill require
health insurers and administrators of health insurance plans to provide notice of the
denial of a claim within 21 days after receiving all information necessary to make a
determination concerning the claim if the information is submitted electronically, or
if the information is not received electronically, within 30 days after receiving the
necessary information. Sections 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15 and 18 also require the
inclusion of certain additional information in such a notice. Sections 10, 14 and 16
make certain other provisions relating to the payment of claims that currently apply
to most health insurers also apply to fraternal benefit societies, organizations for
dental care and managed care organizations so that the requirements governing the
payment of claims are uniform for all health insurers. Sections 2, 12.5, 17.5 and
18.5 of this bill exempt coverage under Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance
Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the requirements of
sections 2, 8, 13, 16 and 18.
Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
notify each participating provider of health care in the network of the
responsibilities of the provider of health care with respect to any applicable
administrative policies and programs of the health carrier. (NRS 687B.730) Section
3 of this bill additionally requires such a health carrier to provide to each
participating provider of health care and each covered person at least annually an
explanation of the process by which the health carrier will provide remittances to or
pay claims submitted by participating providers of health care. Section 3 exempts
coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s Health
Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from all such
notification requirements.
Existing law requires a health carrier which offers or issues a network plan to
establish procedures for the resolution of disputes between the health carrier and a
participating provider of health care. (NRS 687B.820) Section 4 of this bill requires
those procedures to include an efficient process by which a participating provider
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
of health care may challenge the denial by a health carrier of a claim. Section 4
exempts coverage by managed care organizations under Medicaid, the Children’s
Health Insurance Program and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program from the
requirement to establish such procedures. Section 1 of this bill requires the
Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry to establish and
carry out certain programs to facilitate public knowledge and use of the provisions
of this bill.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
WHEREAS, Ensuring timely reimbursement for providers of
health care will enhance the business environment in this State for
providers of health care and improve access to health care for
residents of this State; and
WHEREAS, Prompt payment of claims by health insurers will
create a more stable and attractive landscape for new medical
practices, thereby improving the health care infrastructure of this
State; and
WHEREAS, Delayed payments by insurers have a
disproportionate negative effect on minority communities, whose
residents are less likely to have the means to pay out of pocket for
health care services; now, therefore,
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 679B.550 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
