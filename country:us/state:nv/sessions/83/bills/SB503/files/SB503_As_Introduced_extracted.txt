EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; eliminating the Account for the
Regulation and Supervision of Captive Insurers in the
Fund for Insurance Administration and Enforcement; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Fund for Insurance Administration and Enforcement
2 and requires the Fund to be used solely for the administration and enforcement of
3 the Nevada Insurance Code and other laws and regulations enforced by the
4 Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry. (NRS 680C.100)
5 Existing law creates within the Fund an Account for the Regulation and
6 Supervision of Captive Insurers. (NRS 694C.460) Under existing law, various fees
7 and assessments received by the Commissioner of Insurance or the Division
8 pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing captive insurers and 25 percent
9 of the revenues collected from the tax imposed upon the premiums of a captive
10 insurer are required to be credited to the Account. (NRS 694C.450, 694C.460)
11 Existing law restricts the purposes for which money in the Account may be used.
12 (NRS 694C.460)
13 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill eliminate the Account. Sections 1 and 2 require
14 the fees, assessments and taxes which are required to be credited to the Account
15 under existing law to instead be credited to the Fund, thereby authorizing such fees,
16 assessments and taxes to be used for any other purpose for which any money in the
17 Fund may be used. Section 3 of this bill requires any money remaining on July 1,
18 2025, in the Account to remain in the Fund and specifically authorizes the money to
19 be used for any other purpose for which any money in the Fund may be used.

3 694C.450 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a
4 captive insurer shall pay to the Division, not later than March 1 of
5 each year, a tax at the rate of:
6 (a) Two-fifths of 1 percent on the first $20,000,000 of its net
7 direct premiums;
8 (b) One-fifth of 1 percent on the next $20,000,000 of its net
9 direct premiums; and
10 (c) Seventy-five thousandths of 1 percent on each additional
11 dollar of its net direct premiums.
12 2. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a captive
13 insurer shall pay to the Division, not later than March 1 of each
14 year, a tax at a rate of:
15 (a) Two hundred twenty-five thousandths of 1 percent on the
16 first $20,000,000 of revenue from assumed reinsurance premiums;
17 (b) One hundred fifty thousandths of 1 percent on the next
18 $20,000,000 of revenue from assumed reinsurance premiums; and

21  The tax on reinsurance premiums pursuant to this subsection
22 must not be levied on premiums for risks or portions of risks which

24 captive insurer is not required to pay any reinsurance premium tax
25 pursuant to this subsection on revenue related to the receipt of assets
26 by the captive insurer in exchange for the assumption of loss
27 reserves and other liabilities of another insurer that is under
28 common ownership and control with the captive insurer, if the

30 insurer and the intent of the parties to the transaction is to renew or

37 captive insurer applies only to each protected cell and does not
38 apply to the sponsored captive insurer as a whole.

40 control must be taxed as if they were a single captive insurer.

2 laws of this State from a captive insurer, and no occupation tax or
3 other taxes may be levied or collected from a captive insurer by this
4 State or by any county, city or municipality within this State, except

14 revenues collected must be deposited with the State Treasurer for
15 credit to the State General Fund.
16 7. A captive insurer that is issued a license pursuant to this

19 captive insurer for the first year in which the captive insurer incurs
20 any liability for the payment of taxes pursuant to this section. A
21 captive insurer is entitled to a nonrefundable credit pursuant to this
22 section not more than once after the captive insurer is initially

28 ownership of 80 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of
29 two or more corporations by the same member or members.
30 (2) In the case of a mutual insurer, the direct or indirect
31 ownership of 80 percent or more of the surplus and the voting power
32 of two or more corporations by the same member or members.
33 (b) “Net direct premiums” means the direct premiums collected
34 or contracted for on policies or contracts of insurance written by a
35 captive insurer during the preceding calendar year, less the amounts

43 Insurers. Money in the Account must be used only to carry out the
