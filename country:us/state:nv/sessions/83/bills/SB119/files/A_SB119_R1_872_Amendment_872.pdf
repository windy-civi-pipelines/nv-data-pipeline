Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law directs the Division of Workforce and Economic Development of the
2 College of Southern Nevada to develop, create, oversee and manage the NV Grow Program to
3 provide certain informational and technical assistance to existing small businesses in this State
4 that are expanding or ready to expand. (Section 2 of chapter 459, Statutes of Nevada 2015, as
5 last amended by chapter 440, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 2707) Existing law also
6 requires all institutions of the Nevada System of Higher Education to track the business
7 decisions and growth of each business that participates in the Program over the entire period
8 of the Program and report that data to the Division at least once every 6 months. (Section 3 of
9 chapter 459, Statutes of Nevada 2015, as last amended by chapter 570, Statutes of Nevada
10 2019, at page 3668) Section 2 of this bill revises the name of the Division to the Division of
11 Small Business and Entrepreneurship Development. Section 1 of this bill requires the
12 Division to prepare an annual report for the previous calendar year which must include,
13 without limitation, an explanation of: (1) the assistance provided by the Program to the
14 businesses participating in the Program; and (2) the business decisions and growth of each
15 business participating in the Program. Section 1 further requires the Division to post the
16 annual report on the Internet website of the Program.
17 Existing law establishes certain qualifications for a business to participate in the Program,
18 including that the business must generate at least $50,000 but not more than $700,000 in
19 revenue. (Section 2 of chapter 459, Statutes of Nevada 2015, as last amended by chapter 440,
20 Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 2707) Section 2.5 of this bill instead requires a business to
21 generate at least $35,000 but not more than $700,000 in revenue to qualify to participate.
22 Section 3 of this bill appropriates [$1,900,000] $1,200,000 to the College of Southern
23 Nevada for certain allocations and to assist and carry out the Program.
