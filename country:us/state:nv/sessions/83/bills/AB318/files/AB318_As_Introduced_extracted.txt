AN ACT relating to insurance; authorizing a captive insurer to
directly provide workers’ compensation insurance;
authorizing the Commissioner of Insurance to authorize
or require certain captive insurers to join or contribute
financially to an assigned risk pool or insurance
insolvency guaranty fund; revising provisions setting
forth certain prerequisites before a private carrier may
provide industrial insurance; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of captive insurers by the
2 Commissioner of Insurance. (Chapter 694C of NRS) Existing law sets forth the
3 types of insurance that a captive insurer is authorized to or prohibited from
4 transacting. (NRS 694C.300) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a captive insurer to
5 directly provide workers’ compensation insurance.
6 Existing law prohibits a captive insurer from: (1) joining or contributing
7 financially to an assigned risk pool or insurance insolvency guaranty fund in this
8 State; or (2) receiving any benefit from such a pool or fund for claims arising out of
9 the operations of the captive insurer. (NRS 694C.380) Section 2 of this bill
10 authorizes the Commissioner to authorize or require a captive insurer that directly
11 provides workers’ compensation insurance to join or contribute financially to an
12 assigned risk pool or insurance insolvency guaranty fund in this State. Under
13 section 2, such a captive insurer may receive such benefits from the pool or fund as
14 the Commissioner may authorize.
15 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions upon insurers,
16 including, without limitation, private carriers, concerning the provision of industrial
17 insurance. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing law requires a private carrier,
18 before providing industrial insurance, to be authorized by the Commissioner as an
19 authorized insurer and maintain certain securities applicable to authorized insurers.

20 (NRS 616B.463) Section 4 of this bill revises those requirements to allow a private
21 carrier that is a captive insurer that maintains certain securities required for a
22 captive insurer to provide industrial insurance. Section 3 of this bill revises the
23 definition of “private carrier” to reflect the authorization of a captive insurer to
24 provide industrial insurance.
