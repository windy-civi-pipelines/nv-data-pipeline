AN ACT relating to legislative affairs; revising provisions relating
to requests for the drafting of legislative measures; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the number and timing of requests for the drafting of
2 legislative measures for Legislators and for other requesters. (NRS
3 218D.150-218D.220)
4 Existing law authorizes incumbent members of the Assembly to request, before
5 a regular session, the drafting of up to 9 legislative measures and incumbent
6 Senators to request the drafting of up to 18 legislative measures, with portions of
7 these requests due to the Legislative Counsel by August 1 preceding session and
8 December 10 preceding session. (NRS 218D.150) Section 1 of this bill: (1) reduces
9 the total number of authorized pre-session requests from 9 to 6 for members of the
10 Assembly and from 18 to 12 for Senators; (2) divides this number of pre-session
11 requests equally between the two deadline periods; (3) establishes a deadline for
12 submission of information sufficient in detail to allow for the complete drafting of
13 or a withdrawal of each request for each deadline period; and (4) reduces the
14 number of requests available in subsequent pre-session deadline periods if a
15 Legislator does not submit information sufficient in detail to allow for the complete
16 drafting of or withdraw a request from the previous deadline period.
17 In addition to the requests for the drafting of legislative measures available to
18 Legislators generally, existing law authorizes the Speaker and Minority Leader of
19 the Assembly and the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate to request
20 the drafting of certain additional legislative measures before a regular session.
21 (NRS 218D.155) Section 2 of this bill reduces the number of requests authorized
22 for the Speaker of the Assembly and Majority Leader of the Senate from 15 to 10
23 and for the Minority Leaders of the Assembly and Senate from 10 to 5.
24 Existing law authorizes the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,
25 State Treasurer, State Controller and Attorney General to request the drafting of
-

– 2 –
26 certain numbers of legislative measures before a regular session on or before
27 certain dates and establishes deadlines by which such legislative measures must be
28 prefiled or deemed withdrawn. (NRS 218D.175) Section 3 of this bill revises the
29 deadline for the submission of the request for the drafting of not more than 5
30 legislative measures by the Governor to propose the Governor’s legislative agenda
31 from the 19th day of a regular session to: (1) August 1, if no gubernatorial election
32 will occur before the regular session; or (2) after the first Monday in January and on
33 or before the first day of the regular session, if a gubernatorial election will occur
34 before the regular session.
35 While existing law does not establish a prefiling deadline for legislative
36 measures that propose the Governor’s legislative agenda, Joint Standing Rule No.
37 14.2 of the Senate and Assembly requires all bills to be introduced not later than the
38 50th calendar day of a regular session. Additionally, the Nevada Constitution
39 requires the Governor to submit the proposed executive budget to the Legislature
40 not later than 14 calendar days before the commencement of each regular session.
41 (Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 2) Section 3 establishes deadlines for the legislative
42 measures that propose the Governor’s legislative agenda that require: (1) prefiling
43 such measures on or before the 10th calendar day preceding the regular session if
44 no gubernatorial election will occur before the regular session; or (2) introducing
45 such measures on or before the 15th day of the regular session if a gubernatorial
46 election will occur before the regular session.
47 Finally, section 3 reduces the number of requests for the drafting of legislative
48 measures before a regular session by: (1) the Lieutenant Governor from 3 to 2; (2)
49 the Secretary of State from 8 to 6; (3) the State Treasurer from 5 to 4; (4) the State
50 Controller from 5 to 4; and (5) the Attorney General from 20 to 16.
