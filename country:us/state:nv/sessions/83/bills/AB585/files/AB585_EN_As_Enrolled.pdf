Assembly Bill No. 585–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to legislative affairs; revising provisions relating
to requests for the drafting of legislative measures; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the number and timing of requests for the drafting of
legislative measures for Legislators and for other requesters. (NRS
218D.150-218D.220)
Existing law authorizes incumbent members of the Assembly to request, before
a regular session, the drafting of up to 9 legislative measures and incumbent
Senators to request the drafting of up to 18 legislative measures, with portions of
these requests due to the Legislative Counsel by August 1 preceding session and
December 10 preceding session. (NRS 218D.150) Section 1 of this bill: (1) reduces
the total number of authorized pre-session requests from 9 to 6 for members of the
Assembly and from 18 to 12 for Senators; (2) divides this number of pre-session
requests equally between the two deadline periods; (3) establishes a deadline for
submission of information sufficient in detail to allow for the complete drafting of
or a withdrawal of each request for each deadline period; and (4) reduces the
number of requests available in subsequent pre-session deadline periods if a
Legislator does not submit information sufficient in detail to allow for the complete
drafting of or withdraw a request from the previous deadline period.
In addition to the requests for the drafting of legislative measures available to
Legislators generally, existing law authorizes the Speaker and Minority Leader of
the Assembly and the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate to request
the drafting of certain additional legislative measures before a regular session.
(NRS 218D.155) Section 2 of this bill reduces the number of requests authorized
for the Speaker of the Assembly and Majority Leader of the Senate from 15 to 10
and for the Minority Leaders of the Assembly and Senate from 10 to 5.
Existing law authorizes the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State,
State Treasurer, State Controller and Attorney General to request the drafting of
certain numbers of legislative measures before a regular session on or before
certain dates and establishes deadlines by which such legislative measures must be
prefiled or deemed withdrawn. (NRS 218D.175) Section 3 of this bill revises the
deadline for the submission of the request for the drafting of not more than 5
legislative measures by the Governor to propose the Governor’s legislative agenda
from the 19th day of a regular session to: (1) August 1, if no gubernatorial election
will occur before the regular session; or (2) after the first Monday in January and on
or before the first day of the regular session, if a gubernatorial election will occur
before the regular session.
While existing law does not establish a prefiling deadline for legislative
measures that propose the Governor’s legislative agenda, Joint Standing Rule No.
14.2 of the Senate and Assembly requires all bills to be introduced not later than the
50th calendar day of a regular session. Additionally, the Nevada Constitution
requires the Governor to submit the proposed executive budget to the Legislature
not later than 14 calendar days before the commencement of each regular session.
(Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 2) Section 3 establishes deadlines for the legislative
measures that propose the Governor’s legislative agenda that require: (1) prefiling
such measures on or before the 10th calendar day preceding the regular session if
no gubernatorial election will occur before the regular session; or (2) introducing
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
such measures on or before the 15th day of the regular session if a gubernatorial
election will occur before the regular session.
Finally, section 3 reduces the number of requests for the drafting of legislative
measures before a regular session by: (1) the Lieutenant Governor from 3 to 2; (2)
the Secretary of State from 8 to 6; (3) the State Treasurer from 5 to 4; (4) the State
Controller from 5 to 4; and (5) the Attorney General from 20 to 16.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
