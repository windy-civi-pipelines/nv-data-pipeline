EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing a nonpartisan voter to vote for the
partisan offices of a major political party in a primary election ; [or
presidential preference primary election;] and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, major party candidates for partisan office are nominated at a primary
2 election. (NRS 293.175) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a primary election for a major
3 political party only if the registered voter designated on his or her application to register to
4 vote an affiliation with that major political party. (NRS 293.257)
5 [Existing law further requires, with certain exceptions, that a presidential preference
6 primary election be held in each presidential election year to determine the preferences of the
7 registered voters of a major political party regarding the party’s nominee for President of the
8 United States. (NRS 298.600-298.720) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a presidential
9 preference primary election for a major political party only if the registered voter designated
10 on his or her application to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party. (NRS
11 298.680)]
12 Sections 1 [,] and 2 [, 9 and 11] of this bill authorize a registered voter who has indicated
13 on his or her voter registration that he or she is not affiliated with a political party to vote in a
14 primary election [or presidential preference primary election] for a major political party by
15 requesting a partisan mail ballot [from] in the manner designated by the county clerk or
16 appearing in person at the polls and requesting a partisan ballot. Section 3 of this bill requires
17 a county clerk to prepare and distribute a partisan mail ballot to each registered nonpartisan
18 voter who requests such a ballot.
19 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for an automatic voter registration agency
20 to notify a person during the automatic voter registration process that the person will be
21 unable to vote at [certain] a primary [elections] election for partisan offices of a major
22 political party unless the person indicates a major political party affiliation.
23 Existing law provides that the computer program used in a mechanical voting system
24 must not count unlawful votes, including votes in a primary election [or presidential
25 preference primary election] cast for a candidate other than the candidate of a major political

Assembly Amendment No. 933 to Assembly Bill No. 597 Page 4
26 party other than the party, if any, of the registration of the voter. (NRS 293B.130) Section 5 of
27 this bill removes the prohibition on counting such a vote [,] in a primary election, but still
28 prohibits the computer program from counting unlawful votes.
29 Section 6 of this bill requires a member of an election board in a primary election [or
30 presidential preference primary election] to issue a partisan ballot and, if a mechanical voting
31 system is used, a voting receipt with the name of the major political party, to each nonpartisan
32 voter who requests to vote a partisan ballot under section 1 . [or 9.] Section 7 of this bill
33 provides that this requirement is an exception to the requirement for a member of an election
34 board to issue a nonpartisan voter a nonpartisan ballot and voting receipt with a nonpartisan
35 designation.
36 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to require partisan voters in certain precincts or
37 districts to vote in the same manner as a nonpartisan voter. (NRS 293B.310) Section 8 of this
38 bill authorizes the county clerk to also require nonpartisan voters who request to vote a
39 partisan ballot to vote in such a manner.
40 [Section 10 of this bill applies certain definitions relating to presidential preference
41 primary elections to the provisions of section 9.]
