EMERGENCY REQUEST of Speaker of the Assembly
Assembly Bill No. 597–Assemblymember Yeager
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing a nonpartisan voter to
vote for the partisan offices of a major political party in a
primary election; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, major party candidates for partisan office are nominated at
a primary election. (NRS 293.175) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a primary
election for a major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or
her application to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party.
(NRS 293.257)
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a registered voter who has indicated on
his or her voter registration that he or she is not affiliated with a political party to
vote in a primary election for a major political party by requesting a partisan mail
ballot in the manner designated by the county clerk or appearing in person at the
polls and requesting a partisan ballot. Section 3 of this bill requires a county clerk
to prepare and distribute a partisan mail ballot to each registered nonpartisan voter
who requests such a ballot.
Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for an automatic voter
registration agency to notify a person during the automatic voter registration
process that the person will be unable to vote at a primary election for partisan
offices of a major political party unless the person indicates a major political party
affiliation.
Existing law provides that the computer program used in a mechanical voting
system must not count unlawful votes, including votes in a primary election cast for
a candidate other than the candidate of a major political party other than the party,
if any, of the registration of the voter. (NRS 293B.130) Section 5 of this bill
removes the prohibition on counting such a vote in a primary election, but still
prohibits the computer program from counting unlawful votes.
Section 6 of this bill requires a member of an election board in a primary
election to issue a partisan ballot and, if a mechanical voting system is used, a
voting receipt with the name of the major political party, to each nonpartisan voter
who requests to vote a partisan ballot under section 1. Section 7 of this bill
provides that this requirement is an exception to the requirement for a member of
an election board to issue a nonpartisan voter a nonpartisan ballot and voting
receipt with a nonpartisan designation.
Existing law authorizes a county clerk to require partisan voters in certain
precincts or districts to vote in the same manner as a nonpartisan voter. (NRS
293B.310) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the county clerk to also require
nonpartisan voters who request to vote a partisan ballot to vote in such a manner.

Section 1. Chapter 293 of NRS is hereby amended by adding

limitation, submitting the request by electronic means; or
(b) Appearing in person at the polls during the period for early
voting by personal appearance or on the day of the primary
election and requesting to vote the partisan ballot of the major
political party of the voter’s choice. Regardless of whether a
registered voter has submitted a request to receive a partisan mail
ballot pursuant to paragraph (a), a registered voter may, in lieu of
returning the partisan mail ballot, appear in person at the polls
and request to vote the partisan ballot of the major political party
of the voter’s choice.
2. A registered voter may not cast more than one mail ballot
or ballot in a primary election.

candidacy must appear on the primary ballot of the major political
party designated.
2. The county clerk may choose to place the names of
candidates for nonpartisan offices on the ballots for each major
political party or on a separate nonpartisan primary ballot, but the
arrangement which the county clerk selects must permit all
registered voters to vote on them.
