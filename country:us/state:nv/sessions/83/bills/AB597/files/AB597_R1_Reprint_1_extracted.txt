ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 597–ASSEMBLYMEMBER YEAGER
MAY 26, 2025

Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to elections.
(BDR 24-1245)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 3, 5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing a nonpartisan voter to
vote for the partisan offices of a major political party in a
primary election; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, major party candidates for partisan office are nominated at
2 a primary election. (NRS 293.175) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a primary
3 election for a major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or
4 her application to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party.
5 (NRS 293.257)
6 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a registered voter who has indicated on
7 his or her voter registration that he or she is not affiliated with a political party to
8 vote in a primary election for a major political party by requesting a partisan mail
9 ballot in the manner designated by the county clerk or appearing in person at the
10 polls and requesting a partisan ballot. Section 3 of this bill requires a county clerk
11 to prepare and distribute a partisan mail ballot to each registered nonpartisan voter
12 who requests such a ballot.
13 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for an automatic voter
14 registration agency to notify a person during the automatic voter registration
15 process that the person will be unable to vote at a primary election for partisan
16 offices of a major political party unless the person indicates a major political party
17 affiliation.
18 Existing law provides that the computer program used in a mechanical voting
19 system must not count unlawful votes, including votes in a primary election cast for
20 a candidate other than the candidate of a major political party other than the party,
-
*AB597_R1*
– 2 –
21 if any, of the registration of the voter. (NRS 293B.130) Section 5 of this bill
22 removes the prohibition on counting such a vote in a primary election, but still
23 prohibits the computer program from counting unlawful votes.
24 Section 6 of this bill requires a member of an election board in a primary
25 election to issue a partisan ballot and, if a mechanical voting system is used, a
26 voting receipt with the name of the major political party, to each nonpartisan voter
27 who requests to vote a partisan ballot under section 1. Section 7 of this bill
28 provides that this requirement is an exception to the requirement for a member of
29 an election board to issue a nonpartisan voter a nonpartisan ballot and voting
30 receipt with a nonpartisan designation.
31 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to require partisan voters in certain
32 precincts or districts to vote in the same manner as a nonpartisan voter. (NRS
33 293B.310) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the county clerk to also require
34 nonpartisan voters who request to vote a partisan ballot to vote in such a manner.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 293 of NRS is hereby amended by adding

12 (b) Appearing in person at the polls during the period for early
13 voting by personal appearance or on the day of the primary
14 election and requesting to vote the partisan ballot of the major
15 political party of the voter’s choice. Regardless of whether a

9 3. [A] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a

26 database created by the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 293.675
27 by an automatic voter registration agency, the county clerk shall
28 collate the information into an individual electronic document,

30 clerk shall review the voter registration information transmitted by

____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to elections.
(BDR 24-1245)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 3, 5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing a nonpartisan voter to
vote for the partisan offices of a major political party in a
primary election; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, major party candidates for partisan office are nominated at
2 a primary election. (NRS 293.175) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a primary
3 election for a major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or
4 her application to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party.
5 (NRS 293.257)
6 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a registered voter who has indicated on
7 his or her voter registration that he or she is not affiliated with a political party to
8 vote in a primary election for a major political party by requesting a partisan mail
9 ballot in the manner designated by the county clerk or appearing in person at the
10 polls and requesting a partisan ballot. Section 3 of this bill requires a county clerk
11 to prepare and distribute a partisan mail ballot to each registered nonpartisan voter
12 who requests such a ballot.
13 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for an automatic voter
14 registration agency to notify a person during the automatic voter registration
15 process that the person will be unable to vote at a primary election for partisan
16 offices of a major political party unless the person indicates a major political party
17 affiliation.
18 Existing law provides that the computer program used in a mechanical voting
19 system must not count unlawful votes, including votes in a primary election cast for
20 a candidate other than the candidate of a major political party other than the party,
-
*AB597_R1*

– 2 –
21 if any, of the registration of the voter. (NRS 293B.130) Section 5 of this bill
22 removes the prohibition on counting such a vote in a primary election, but still
23 prohibits the computer program from counting unlawful votes.
24 Section 6 of this bill requires a member of an election board in a primary
25 election to issue a partisan ballot and, if a mechanical voting system is used, a
26 voting receipt with the name of the major political party, to each nonpartisan voter
27 who requests to vote a partisan ballot under section 1. Section 7 of this bill
28 provides that this requirement is an exception to the requirement for a member of
29 an election board to issue a nonpartisan voter a nonpartisan ballot and voting
30 receipt with a nonpartisan designation.
31 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to require partisan voters in certain
32 precincts or districts to vote in the same manner as a nonpartisan voter. (NRS
33 293B.310) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the county clerk to also require
34 nonpartisan voters who request to vote a partisan ballot to vote in such a manner.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 293 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. A registered voter who designated on his or her application
4 to register to vote no affiliation with a political party may vote in a
5 primary election for the partisan offices of a major political party
6 by:
