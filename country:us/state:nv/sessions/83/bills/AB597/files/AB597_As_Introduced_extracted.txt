EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing a nonpartisan voter to
vote for the partisan offices of a major political party in a
primary election or presidential preference primary
election; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, major party candidates for partisan office are nominated at
2 a primary election. (NRS 293.175) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a primary
3 election for a major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or
4 her application to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party.
5 (NRS 293.257)
6 Existing law further requires, with certain exceptions, that a presidential
7 preference primary election be held in each presidential election year to determine
8 the preferences of the registered voters of a major political party regarding the
9 party’s nominee for President of the United States. (NRS 298.600-298.720) A
10 registered voter may cast a ballot in a presidential preference primary election for a
11 major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or her application
12 to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party. (NRS 298.680)
13 Sections 1, 2, 9 and 11 of this bill authorize a registered voter who has
14 indicated on his or her voter registration that he or she is not affiliated with a
15 political party to vote in a primary election or presidential preference primary
16 election for a major political party by requesting a partisan mail ballot from the
17 county clerk or appearing in person at the polls and requesting a partisan ballot.
18 Section 3 of this bill requires a county clerk to prepare and distribute a partisan
19 mail ballot to each registered nonpartisan voter who requests such a ballot.

20 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for an automatic voter
21 registration agency to notify a person during the automatic voter registration
22 process that the person will be unable to vote at certain primary elections for
23 partisan offices of a major political party unless the person indicates a major
24 political party affiliation.
25 Existing law provides that the computer program used in a mechanical voting
26 system must not count unlawful votes, including votes in a primary election or
27 presidential preference primary election cast for a candidate other than the
28 candidate of a major political party other than the party, if any, of the registration of
29 the voter. (NRS 293B.130) Section 5 of this bill removes the prohibition on
30 counting such a vote, but still prohibits the computer program from counting
31 unlawful votes.
32 Section 6 of this bill requires a member of an election board in a primary
33 election or presidential preference primary election to issue a partisan ballot and, if
34 a mechanical voting system is used, a voting receipt with the name of the major
35 political party, to each nonpartisan voter who requests to vote a partisan ballot
36 under section 1 or 9. Section 7 of this bill provides that this requirement is an
37 exception to the requirement for a member of an election board to issue a
38 nonpartisan voter a nonpartisan ballot and voting receipt with a nonpartisan
39 designation.
40 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to require partisan voters in certain
41 precincts or districts to vote in the same manner as a nonpartisan voter. (NRS
42 293B.310) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the county clerk to also require
43 nonpartisan voters who request to vote a partisan ballot to vote in such a manner.
44 Section 10 of this bill applies certain definitions relating to presidential
45 preference primary elections to the provisions of section 9.

EMERGENCY REQUEST OF SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 597–ASSEMBLYMEMBER YEAGER
MAY 26, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to elections.
(BDR 24-1245)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 3, 5, 9)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing a nonpartisan voter to
vote for the partisan offices of a major political party in a
primary election or presidential preference primary
election; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, major party candidates for partisan office are nominated at
2 a primary election. (NRS 293.175) A registered voter may cast a ballot in a primary
3 election for a major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or
4 her application to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party.
5 (NRS 293.257)
6 Existing law further requires, with certain exceptions, that a presidential
7 preference primary election be held in each presidential election year to determine
8 the preferences of the registered voters of a major political party regarding the
9 party’s nominee for President of the United States. (NRS 298.600-298.720) A
10 registered voter may cast a ballot in a presidential preference primary election for a
11 major political party only if the registered voter designated on his or her application
12 to register to vote an affiliation with that major political party. (NRS 298.680)
13 Sections 1, 2, 9 and 11 of this bill authorize a registered voter who has
14 indicated on his or her voter registration that he or she is not affiliated with a
15 political party to vote in a primary election or presidential preference primary
16 election for a major political party by requesting a partisan mail ballot from the
17 county clerk or appearing in person at the polls and requesting a partisan ballot.
18 Section 3 of this bill requires a county clerk to prepare and distribute a partisan
19 mail ballot to each registered nonpartisan voter who requests such a ballot.

20 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for an automatic voter
21 registration agency to notify a person during the automatic voter registration
22 process that the person will be unable to vote at certain primary elections for
23 partisan offices of a major political party unless the person indicates a major
24 political party affiliation.
25 Existing law provides that the computer program used in a mechanical voting
26 system must not count unlawful votes, including votes in a primary election or
27 presidential preference primary election cast for a candidate other than the
28 candidate of a major political party other than the party, if any, of the registration of
29 the voter. (NRS 293B.130) Section 5 of this bill removes the prohibition on
30 counting such a vote, but still prohibits the computer program from counting
31 unlawful votes.
32 Section 6 of this bill requires a member of an election board in a primary
33 election or presidential preference primary election to issue a partisan ballot and, if
34 a mechanical voting system is used, a voting receipt with the name of the major
35 political party, to each nonpartisan voter who requests to vote a partisan ballot
36 under section 1 or 9. Section 7 of this bill provides that this requirement is an
37 exception to the requirement for a member of an election board to issue a
38 nonpartisan voter a nonpartisan ballot and voting receipt with a nonpartisan
39 designation.
40 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to require partisan voters in certain
41 precincts or districts to vote in the same manner as a nonpartisan voter. (NRS
42 293B.310) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the county clerk to also require
43 nonpartisan voters who request to vote a partisan ballot to vote in such a manner.
44 Section 10 of this bill applies certain definitions relating to presidential
45 preference primary elections to the provisions of section 9.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
