Assembly Amendment No. 523 to Assembly Bill No. 104 Page 4
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to
2 make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy districts, conservation
3 districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the
4 property and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
5 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of
6 Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and
7 Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill
8 creates the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a grant
9 program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
10 Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program [and the Advisory Committee are] is within
11 the Department. Section 13 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
12 Department to the provisions of sections [8-12.] 8-10 of this bill.
13 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to change the
14 place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already appropriated, must apply to
15 the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325) Existing law further provides that all
16 underground waters within the boundaries of the State are subject to appropriation for
17 beneficial use only under the laws of this State relating to the appropriation and use of water.
18 (NRS 534.020) Section 9 [of this bill] creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be
19 administered by the Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,
20 and requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of [water] vested or
21 certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 [of this bill] establishes the
22 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and
23 Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes requirements for : (1)
24 the purchase and retirement of [water] vested or certificated groundwater rights [.] ; and (2)
25 the acceptance of donations of groundwater rights. Section 10 also prohibits the Director
26 from accepting donations and applications for the purchase and retirement of [water] such
27 groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes
28 to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or donations after that date.
29 Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all vested or certificated
30 water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
31 Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any [water] groundwater rights
32 from the Program [after] unless the purchase or donation of the groundwater right was
33 approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
34 [Section 11 of this bill establishes the Advisory Committee for the Nevada Voluntary
35 Water Rights Retirement Program within the Department and requires the Advisory
36 Committee to consult with the Director regarding the provisions of sections 10 and 12 of this
37 bill.
38 Section 12 requires the Director to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions
39 of sections 8-12. Section 24 of this bill requires the Director to adopt these regulations by July
40 1, 2026.]
41 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights have been
42 retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
43 Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account [, Advisory
44 Committee and regulations] set forth in [sections] section 9 [, 11, 12 and 14] to expire on June
45 30, 2035. [Sections 15 and] Section 21 of this bill [make] makes a conforming [changes]
46 change to reflect the expiration of these provisions.
47 Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to appropriate
48 groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under certain circumstances.
49 In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the State Engineer is required to
50 prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water can be furnished by a public entity
51 presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections
52 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.
53 Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit issued by the
54 State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a revocable permit. Section
55 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if a
56 property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a public entity presently engaged in
57 furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.

Assembly Amendment No. 523 to Assembly Bill No. 104 Page 5
58 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of water and
59 eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation and capital
60 improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients may receive grants of
61 money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water. (NRS 349.981) Section 16
62 includes in the types of improvements for which an eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1)
63 the removal and replacement of grass with water-efficient landscaping, under certain
64 circumstances; and (2) the permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
65 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to provide
66 an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects that will be used
67 for the same purpose as the grant [.] and which must be based upon the average household
68 income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section 17 of this bill instead
69 requires [all recipients of a grant of money from this program to provide an] the amount of
70 money [determined by the Board that will be used for the same purpose as the grant.]
71 provided by a recipient to be based upon the median household income of the customers
72 of the recipient.
73 Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial assistance
74 program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an existing septic system
75 whose property is served by a municipal water system to connect to the community sewerage
76 disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18 of this bill establishes certain requirements for a
77 property owner to be eligible to receive financial assistance from this program.
78 Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the people of this
79 State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this right to clean water. (NRS
80 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of this State to encourage and promote
81 water reuse in an appropriate manner that is consistent with public health.
82 Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish water quality
83 standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial
84 use or uses for the stream segment or other body of surface water that have been determined
85 applicable by the Commission. (NRS 445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to
86 establish a variance in the water quality standard from the water quality standard determined
87 to protect and ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state
88 determines that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §
89 131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water quality standard
90 variance in accordance with federal law.
91 The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions
92 relating to conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain
93 parcels of property which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water efficiency
94 monitoring program. (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2179) The Act
95 requires the Board of Directors of the Southern Nevada Water Authority to: (1)
96 establish deadlines for an owner of such a parcel of property to begin participating in
97 the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or she is required to participate by not
98 later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page
99 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the Board of Directors to notify the owner
100 not less than 1 year before the program is established.
101 Section 21.3 of this bill authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority or a
102 member agency thereof that charges an excessive use fee to residential customers to use
103 the proceeds of the fee for certain programs to assist customers of the Authority or
104 member agency.
105 Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an Advisory
106 Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley Groundwater
107 Basin. If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to serve, the Board
108 of Directors is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days
109 after the vacancy occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of Nevada 1997, as last
110 amended by chapter 517, Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page 3507) Section 21.7 of this bill
111 removes the requirement for the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy not later than 90
112 days after the vacancy occurs.

14 groundwater right that has been retired pursuant to this section is not available
15 for any use and shall be deemed to be retired in the source in perpetuity.
16 2. The State Engineer shall not retire any [water rights] vested or
17 certificated groundwater right pursuant to subsection 1 [after] unless the

25 capacity may make such rules, regulations and orders as are deemed essential for
26 the welfare of the area involved.
27 2. In the interest of public welfare, the State Engineer is authorized and
28 directed to designate preferred uses of water within the respective areas so
29 designated by the State Engineer and from which the groundwater is being
30 depleted, and in acting on applications to appropriate groundwater, the State
31 Engineer may designate such preferred uses in different categories with respect to
32 the particular areas involved within the following limits:
33 (a) Domestic, municipal, quasi-municipal, industrial, irrigation, mining and
34 stock-watering uses; and
35 (b) Any uses for which a county, city, town, public water district or public
36 water company furnishes the water.
37 3. The State Engineer may only issue [temporary] revocable permits to
38 appropriate groundwater if water cannot be furnished by a public entity such as a
39 water district or municipality presently engaged in furnishing water to the
40 inhabitants thereof. Such [temporary] revocable permits can be limited as to time
41 and may be revoked if and when:
42 (a) Water can be furnished by a public entity such as a water district or a
43 municipality presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants thereof; and

3 engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants thereof.
4 (d) In connection with the approval of a parcel map in which any parcel is
5 proposed to be served by a domestic well, require the dedication to a city or county
6 or a designee of a city or county, or require a relinquishment to the State Engineer,
7 of any right to appropriate water required by the State Engineer to ensure a
8 sufficient supply of water for each of those parcels, unless the dedication of the
9 right to appropriate water is required by a local ordinance.
10 5. In an area in which revocable permits have been issued [temporary
11 permits] pursuant to subsection 3, the State Engineer:

31 provisions of this section with respect to public housing authorities.
32 7. The provisions of this section do not prohibit the State Engineer from
33 revoking a [temporary] revocable permit issued pursuant to this section if any
34 parcel served by a well pursuant to the [temporary] revocable permit is currently
