Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources to make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy
districts, conservation districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect,
preserve and obtain the benefits of the property and natural and cultural resources
of this State and requires the Director to adopt regulations to make such grants.
(Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page
2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill creates
the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a
grant program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
Retirement Program. Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program is within the
Department. Section 13 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
the Department to the provisions of sections 8-10 of this bill.
Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 9
creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the Director
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and requires that
the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or certificated
groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 establishes the Nevada
Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and
Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes
requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or certificated
groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of groundwater rights.

Section 2:
Section 10 also prohibits the Director from accepting donations and applications
for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater rights after June 30, 2035.

Section 3:
Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the Director may
not accept applications or donations after that date.

Section 4:
Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
certificated water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water
Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any
groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the
groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.

Section 5:
Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights
have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
Program.

Section 6:
Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account set
forth in section 9 to expire on June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes a
conforming change to reflect the expiration of these provisions.
Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to
appropriate groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under
certain circumstances. In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the
State Engineer is required to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water
can be furnished by a public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the
inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise
references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.

Section 7:
Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit
issued by the State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a
revocable permit. Section 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling
of wells for domestic use if a property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a
public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.
Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation
and capital improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients
may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
(NRS 349.981) Section 16 includes in the types of improvements for which an
eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1) the removal and replacement of grass
with water-efficient landscaping, under certain circumstances; and (2) the
permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to
provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects
that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the
average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section
17 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be
based upon the median household income of the customers of the recipient.
Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial
assistance program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an
existing septic system whose property is served by a municipal water system to
connect to the community sewerage disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
of this bill establishes certain requirements for a property owner to be eligible to
receive financial assistance from this program.
Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the
people of this State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this
right to clean water. (NRS 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of
this State to encourage and promote water reuse in an appropriate manner that is
consistent with public health.
Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish
water quality standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of
the designated beneficial use or uses for the stream segment or other body of
surface water that have been determined applicable by the Commission. (NRS
445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a variance in the
water quality standard from the water quality standard determined to protect and
ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state determines
that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §

Section 8:
131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water
quality standard variance in accordance with federal law.
The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions
relating to conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain
parcels of property which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water
efficiency monitoring program. (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
2179) The Act requires the Board of Directors of the Southern Nevada Water
Authority to: (1) establish deadlines for an owner of such a parcel of property to
begin participating in the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or she is
required to participate by not later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210,
Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the
Board of Directors to notify the owner not less than 1 year before the program is
established.
Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an
Advisory Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley
Groundwater Basin. If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to
serve, the Board of Directors is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not
later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of
Nevada 1997, as last amended by chapter 517, Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page
3507) Section 21.7 of this bill removes the requirement for the Board of Directors
to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs.

Assembly Bill No. 104–Committee on Natural Resources
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire
certain groundwater rights; revising provisions relating to
temporary permits to appropriate groundwater; creating the
Nevada Conservation and Recreation Program; creating
the Account for Retiring Water Rights; establishing the
Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program;
requiring the Director of the State Department of Conservation
and Natural Resources to purchase certain water rights with
money from the Account for the purpose of retiring those
water rights; revising provisions relating to the program to
provide grants of money to pay certain costs related to water
conservation and capital improvements to water systems;
revising provisions relating to a program to pay the costs for
property owners to connect to a community sewerage disposal
system under certain circumstances; revising certain legislative
declarations relating to clean water and water pollution;
authorizing the State Environmental Commission to establish a
water quality standard variance; revising provisions relating to
an irrigation water efficiency monitoring program established
by the Southern Nevada Water Authority; revising provisions
relating to membership on the Advisory Committee for the
Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley
Groundwater Basin; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources to make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy
districts, conservation districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect,
preserve and obtain the benefits of the property and natural and cultural resources
of this State and requires the Director to adopt regulations to make such grants.
(Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page
2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill creates
the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a
grant program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
Retirement Program. Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program is within the
Department. Section 13 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
the Department to the provisions of sections 8-10 of this bill.
Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 9
creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the Director
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and requires that
the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or certificated
groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 establishes the Nevada
Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and
Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes
requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or certificated
groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of groundwater rights.
Section 10 also prohibits the Director from accepting donations and applications
for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater rights after June 30, 2035.
Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the Director may
not accept applications or donations after that date.
Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
certificated water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water
Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any
groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the
groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights
have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
Program.
Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account set
forth in section 9 to expire on June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes a
conforming change to reflect the expiration of these provisions.
Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to
appropriate groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under
certain circumstances. In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the
State Engineer is required to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water
can be furnished by a public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the
inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise
references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.
Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit
issued by the State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a
revocable permit. Section 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling
of wells for domestic use if a property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a
public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.
Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation
and capital improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients
may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
(NRS 349.981) Section 16 includes in the types of improvements for which an
eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1) the removal and replacement of grass
with water-efficient landscaping, under certain circumstances; and (2) the
permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to
provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects
that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the
average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section
17 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be
based upon the median household income of the customers of the recipient.
Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial
assistance program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an
existing septic system whose property is served by a municipal water system to
connect to the community sewerage disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
of this bill establishes certain requirements for a property owner to be eligible to
receive financial assistance from this program.
Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the
people of this State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this
right to clean water. (NRS 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of
this State to encourage and promote water reuse in an appropriate manner that is
consistent with public health.
Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish
water quality standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of
the designated beneficial use or uses for the stream segment or other body of
surface water that have been determined applicable by the Commission. (NRS
445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a variance in the
water quality standard from the water quality standard determined to protect and
ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state determines
that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §
131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water
quality standard variance in accordance with federal law.
The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions
relating to conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain
parcels of property which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water
efficiency monitoring program. (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
2179) The Act requires the Board of Directors of the Southern Nevada Water
Authority to: (1) establish deadlines for an owner of such a parcel of property to
begin participating in the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or she is
required to participate by not later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210,
Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the
Board of Directors to notify the owner not less than 1 year before the program is
established.
Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an
Advisory Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley
Groundwater Basin. If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to
serve, the Board of Directors is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not
later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of
Nevada 1997, as last amended by chapter 517, Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page
3507) Section 21.7 of this bill removes the requirement for the Board of Directors
to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

appropriation. Any decreed or certificated groundwater right that
has been retired pursuant to this section is not available for any
use and shall be deemed to be retired in the source in perpetuity.
2. The State Engineer shall not retire any decreed or
certificated groundwater right pursuant to subsection 1 unless the
purchase of the groundwater right or the donation of the
groundwater right was approved by the Director of the State
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources pursuant to
section 10 of this act on or before June 30, 2035.
Sec. 5. NRS 534.120 is hereby amended to read as follows:

judgment of the State Engineer, the groundwater basin is being
depleted, the State Engineer in his or her administrative capacity
may make such rules, regulations and orders as are deemed essential
for the welfare of the area involved.
2. In the interest of public welfare, the State Engineer is
authorized and directed to designate preferred uses of water within
the respective areas so designated by the State Engineer and from
which the groundwater is being depleted, and in acting on
applications to appropriate groundwater, the State Engineer may
designate such preferred uses in different categories with respect to
the particular areas involved within the following limits:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
(a) Domestic, municipal, quasi-municipal, industrial, irrigation,
mining and stock-watering uses; and
(b) Any uses for which a county, city, town, public water district
or public water company furnishes the water.
3. The State Engineer may only issue [temporary] revocable
permits to appropriate groundwater if water cannot be furnished by
a public entity such as a water district or municipality presently
engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants thereof. Such
[temporary] revocable permits can be limited as to time and may be
revoked if and when:
(a) Water can be furnished by a public entity such as a water
