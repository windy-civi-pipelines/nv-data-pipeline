Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to
2 make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy districts, conservation
3 districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the
4 property and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
Senate Amendment No. 628 to Assembly Bill No. 104 First Reprint Page 4
5 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of
6 Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and
7 Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill
8 creates the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a grant
9 program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
10 Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 13 of this
11 bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of
12 sections 8-10 of this bill.
13 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to change the
14 place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already appropriated, must apply to
15 the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325) Existing law further provides that all
16 underground waters within the boundaries of the State are subject to appropriation for
17 beneficial use only under the laws of this State relating to the appropriation and use of water.
18 (NRS 534.020) Section 9 creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered
19 by the Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and requires
20 that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of [vested] decreed or
21 certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 establishes the Nevada
22 Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
23 Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes requirements for: (1) the
24 purchase and retirement of [vested] decreed or certificated groundwater rights; and (2) the
25 acceptance of donations of groundwater rights. Section 10 also prohibits the Director from
26 accepting donations and applications for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater
27 rights after June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the
28 Director may not accept applications or donations after that date.
29 Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all [vested] decreed or
30 certificated water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
31 Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any groundwater rights
32 from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the groundwater right was approved by
33 the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
34 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights have been
35 retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
36 Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account set forth in
37 section 9 to expire on June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes a conforming change to
38 reflect the expiration of these provisions.
39 Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to appropriate
40 groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under certain circumstances.
41 In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the State Engineer is required to
42 prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water can be furnished by a public entity
43 presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections
44 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.
45 Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit issued by the
46 State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a revocable permit. Section
47 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if a
48 property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a public entity presently engaged in
49 furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.
50 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of water and
51 eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation and capital
52 improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients may receive grants of
53 money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water. (NRS 349.981) Section 16
54 includes in the types of improvements for which an eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1)
55 the removal and replacement of grass with water-efficient landscaping, under certain
56 circumstances; and (2) the permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
57 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to provide
58 an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects that will be used
59 for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the average household
60 income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section 17 of this bill instead
61 requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be based upon the median household
62 income of the customers of the recipient.
Senate Amendment No. 628 to Assembly Bill No. 104 First Reprint Page 5
63 Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial assistance
64 program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an existing septic system
65 whose property is served by a municipal water system to connect to the community sewerage
66 disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18 of this bill establishes certain requirements for a
67 property owner to be eligible to receive financial assistance from this program.
68 Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the people of this
69 State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this right to clean water. (NRS
70 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of this State to encourage and promote
71 water reuse in an appropriate manner that is consistent with public health.
72 Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish water quality
73 standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial
74 use or uses for the stream segment or other body of surface water that have been determined
75 applicable by the Commission. (NRS 445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to
76 establish a variance in the water quality standard from the water quality standard determined
77 to protect and ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state
78 determines that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §
79 131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water quality standard
80 variance in accordance with federal law.
81 The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions relating to
82 conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain parcels of property
83 which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water efficiency monitoring program.
84 (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2179) The Act requires the Board of Directors
85 of the Southern Nevada Water Authority to: (1) establish deadlines for an owner of such a
86 parcel of property to begin participating in the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or
87 she is required to participate by not later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210,
88 Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the Board of
89 Directors to notify the owner not less than 1 year before the program is established.
90 [Section 21.3 of this bill authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority or a member
91 agency thereof that charges an excessive use fee to residential customers to use the proceeds
92 of the fee for certain programs to assist customers of the Authority or member agency.]
93 Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an Advisory
94 Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley Groundwater Basin.
95 If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to serve, the Board of Directors
96 is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy
97 occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of Nevada 1997, as last amended by chapter 517,
98 Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page 3507) Section 21.7 of this bill removes the requirement for
99 the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs.

45 groundwater rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water
46 Rights Retirement Program pursuant to section 10 of this act using any
47 appropriate mechanism, as determined by the State Engineer, and preclude that
48 groundwater from appropriation. Any [vested] decreed or certificated
49 groundwater right that has been retired pursuant to this section is not available
50 for any use and shall be deemed to be retired in the source in perpetuity.
51 2. The State Engineer shall not retire any [vested] decreed or certificated
52 groundwater right pursuant to subsection 1 unless the purchase of the
53 groundwater right or the donation of the groundwater right was approved by the

1 Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources
2 pursuant to section 10 of this act on or before June 30, 2035.
3 Sec. 5. NRS 534.120 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 534.120 1. Within an area that has been designated by the State Engineer, as
5 provided for in this chapter, where, in the judgment of the State Engineer, the
6 groundwater basin is being depleted, the State Engineer in his or her administrative
7 capacity may make such rules, regulations and orders as are deemed essential for
8 the welfare of the area involved.
9 2. In the interest of public welfare, the State Engineer is authorized and
10 directed to designate preferred uses of water within the respective areas so
11 designated by the State Engineer and from which the groundwater is being
12 depleted, and in acting on applications to appropriate groundwater, the State
13 Engineer may designate such preferred uses in different categories with respect to
14 the particular areas involved within the following limits:
15 (a) Domestic, municipal, quasi-municipal, industrial, irrigation, mining and
16 stock-watering uses; and
17 (b) Any uses for which a county, city, town, public water district or public
18 water company furnishes the water.
19 3. The State Engineer may only issue [temporary] revocable permits to
20 appropriate groundwater if water cannot be furnished by a public entity such as a
21 water district or municipality presently engaged in furnishing water to the
22 inhabitants thereof. Such [temporary] revocable permits can be limited as to time
23 and may be revoked if and when:
24 (a) Water can be furnished by a public entity such as a water district or a
25 municipality presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants thereof; and
26 (b) The property served is within 1,250 feet of the water furnished pursuant to
27 paragraph (a).
28  The holder of a [temporary] revocable permit that is revoked pursuant to this
29 subsection must be given 730 days from the date of revocation to connect to the
30 public entity furnishing water.
31 4. In a basin designated pursuant to NRS 534.030, the State Engineer may:

39 (d) In connection with the approval of a parcel map in which any parcel is
40 proposed to be served by a domestic well, require the dedication to a city or county
41 or a designee of a city or county, or require a relinquishment to the State Engineer,
42 of any right to appropriate water required by the State Engineer to ensure a
43 sufficient supply of water for each of those parcels, unless the dedication of the
44 right to appropriate water is required by a local ordinance.
45 5. In an area in which revocable permits have been issued [temporary
46 permits] pursuant to subsection 3, the State Engineer:
47 (a) Shall:
48 (1) Deny any applications to appropriate groundwater for use in areas
49 served by a public entity such as a water district or a municipality presently
50 engaged in furnishing water;
51 (2) Limit the depth of a domestic well; or

7 (1) The distance from the property line of any parcel served by the well to
8 the pipes and other appurtenances of the proposed source of water to which the
9 property will be connected is not more than 180 feet; and
10 (2) The deepening or repair of the well would require the use of a well-
11 drilling rig.
12 6. For good and sufficient reasons, the State Engineer may exempt the
13 provisions of this section with respect to public housing authorities.
14 7. The provisions of this section do not prohibit the State Engineer from
15 revoking a [temporary] revocable permit issued pursuant to this section if any
16 parcel served by a well pursuant to the [temporary] revocable permit is currently
17 obtaining water from a public entity such as a water district or a municipality
18 engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.
19 Sec. 6. NRS 534.125 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 534.125 If the State Engineer issues a [temporary] revocable permit pursuant

to appropriate groundwater; creating the Nevada Conservation and
Recreation Program; creating the Account for Retiring Water Rights;
establishing the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program;
requiring the Director of the State Department of Conservation and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to
2 make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy districts, conservation
3 districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the
4 property and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt

Senate Amendment No. 628 to Assembly Bill No. 104 First Reprint Page 4
5 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of
6 Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and
7 Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill
8 creates the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a grant
9 program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
10 Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 13 of this
11 bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of
12 sections 8-10 of this bill.
13 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to change the
14 place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already appropriated, must apply to
15 the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325) Existing law further provides that all
16 underground waters within the boundaries of the State are subject to appropriation for
17 beneficial use only under the laws of this State relating to the appropriation and use of water.
18 (NRS 534.020) Section 9 creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered
19 by the Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and requires
20 that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of [vested] decreed or
21 certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 establishes the Nevada
22 Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
23 Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes requirements for: (1) the
24 purchase and retirement of [vested] decreed or certificated groundwater rights; and (2) the
25 acceptance of donations of groundwater rights. Section 10 also prohibits the Director from
26 accepting donations and applications for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater
27 rights after June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the
28 Director may not accept applications or donations after that date.
29 Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all [vested] decreed or
30 certificated water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
31 Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any groundwater rights
32 from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the groundwater right was approved by
33 the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
34 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights have been
35 retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
36 Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account set forth in
37 section 9 to expire on June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes a conforming change to
38 reflect the expiration of these provisions.
39 Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to appropriate
40 groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under certain circumstances.
41 In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the State Engineer is required to
42 prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water can be furnished by a public entity
43 presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections
44 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.
45 Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit issued by the
46 State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a revocable permit. Section
47 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if a
48 property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a public entity presently engaged in
49 furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.
50 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of water and
51 eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation and capital
52 improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients may receive grants of
53 money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water. (NRS 349.981) Section 16
54 includes in the types of improvements for which an eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1)
55 the removal and replacement of grass with water-efficient landscaping, under certain
56 circumstances; and (2) the permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
57 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to provide
58 an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects that will be used
59 for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the average household
60 income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section 17 of this bill instead
61 requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be based upon the median household
62 income of the customers of the recipient.

Senate Amendment No. 628 to Assembly Bill No. 104 First Reprint Page 5
63 Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial assistance
64 program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an existing septic system
65 whose property is served by a municipal water system to connect to the community sewerage
66 disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18 of this bill establishes certain requirements for a
67 property owner to be eligible to receive financial assistance from this program.
68 Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the people of this
69 State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this right to clean water. (NRS
70 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of this State to encourage and promote
71 water reuse in an appropriate manner that is consistent with public health.
72 Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish water quality
73 standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial
74 use or uses for the stream segment or other body of surface water that have been determined
75 applicable by the Commission. (NRS 445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to
76 establish a variance in the water quality standard from the water quality standard determined
77 to protect and ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state
78 determines that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §
79 131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water quality standard
80 variance in accordance with federal law.
81 The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions relating to
82 conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain parcels of property
83 which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water efficiency monitoring program.
84 (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2179) The Act requires the Board of Directors
85 of the Southern Nevada Water Authority to: (1) establish deadlines for an owner of such a
86 parcel of property to begin participating in the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or
87 she is required to participate by not later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210,
88 Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the Board of
89 Directors to notify the owner not less than 1 year before the program is established.
90 [Section 21.3 of this bill authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority or a member
91 agency thereof that charges an excessive use fee to residential customers to use the proceeds
92 of the fee for certain programs to assist customers of the Authority or member agency.]
93 Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an Advisory
94 Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley Groundwater Basin.
95 If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to serve, the Board of Directors
96 is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy
97 occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of Nevada 1997, as last amended by chapter 517,
98 Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page 3507) Section 21.7 of this bill removes the requirement for
99 the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 533.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:

22 Engineer shall approve an application submitted in proper form which contemplates
23 the application of water to beneficial use if:
24 (a) The application is accompanied by the prescribed fees;
25 (b) The proposed use or change, if within an irrigation district, does not
26 adversely affect the cost of water for other holders of water rights in the district or
27 lessen the efficiency of the district in its delivery or use of water; and
28 (c) The applicant provides proof satisfactory to the State Engineer of the
29 applicant’s:
30 (1) Intention in good faith to construct any work necessary to apply the

4 base its water quality standards on water quality criteria which numerically or
5 descriptively define the conditions necessary to maintain the designated beneficial
6 use or uses of the water. The water quality standards must reflect water quality
7 criteria which define the conditions necessary to support, protect and allow the
8 propagation of fish, shellfish and other wildlife and to provide for recreation in and
9 on the water if these objectives are reasonably attainable.
10 3. The Commission may establish water quality standards for individual
11 segments of streams or for other bodies of surface water which vary from standards
12 based on recognized criteria if such variations are justified by the circumstances
