Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural
2 Resources to make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy
3 districts, conservation districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect,
4 preserve and obtain the benefits of the property and natural and cultural resources
5 of this State and requires the Director to adopt regulations to make such grants.
6 (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page
7 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
8 Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill creates
9 the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a
10 grant program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
11 Retirement Program. Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program is within the
12 Department. Section 13 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
13 the Department to the provisions of sections 8-10 of this bill.
14 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
15 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
16 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
17 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
18 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
19 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 9
20 creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the Director
21 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and requires that
22 the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or certificated
23 groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 establishes the Nevada
24 Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and
25 Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes
26 requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or certificated
27 groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of groundwater rights.
28 Section 10 also prohibits the Director from accepting donations and applications
29 for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater rights after June 30, 2035.
30 Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the Director may
31 not accept applications or donations after that date.
32 Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
33 certificated water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water
34 Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any
35 groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the
36 groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
37 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights
38 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
39 Program.
40 Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account set
41 forth in section 9 to expire on June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes a
42 conforming change to reflect the expiration of these provisions.
43 Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to
44 appropriate groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under
45 certain circumstances. In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the
46 State Engineer is required to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water
47 can be furnished by a public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the
48 inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise
49 references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.
50 Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit
51 issued by the State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a
52 revocable permit. Section 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling
53 of wells for domestic use if a property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a
54 public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.

55 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
56 water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation
57 and capital improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients
58 may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
59 (NRS 349.981) Section 16 includes in the types of improvements for which an
60 eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1) the removal and replacement of grass
61 with water-efficient landscaping, under certain circumstances; and (2) the
62 permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
63 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to
64 provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects
65 that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the
66 average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section
67 17 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be
68 based upon the median household income of the customers of the recipient.
69 Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial
70 assistance program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an
71 existing septic system whose property is served by a municipal water system to
72 connect to the community sewerage disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18
73 of this bill establishes certain requirements for a property owner to be eligible to
74 receive financial assistance from this program.
75 Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the
76 people of this State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this
77 right to clean water. (NRS 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of
78 this State to encourage and promote water reuse in an appropriate manner that is
79 consistent with public health.
80 Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish
81 water quality standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of
82 the designated beneficial use or uses for the stream segment or other body of
83 surface water that have been determined applicable by the Commission. (NRS
84 445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a variance in the
85 water quality standard from the water quality standard determined to protect and
86 ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state determines
87 that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §
88 131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water
89 quality standard variance in accordance with federal law.
90 The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions
91 relating to conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain
92 parcels of property which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water
93 efficiency monitoring program. (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
94 2179) The Act requires the Board of Directors of the Southern Nevada Water
95 Authority to: (1) establish deadlines for an owner of such a parcel of property to
96 begin participating in the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or she is
97 required to participate by not later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210,
98 Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the
99 Board of Directors to notify the owner not less than 1 year before the program is
100 established.
101 Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an
102 Advisory Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley
103 Groundwater Basin. If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to
104 serve, the Board of Directors is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not
105 later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of
106 Nevada 1997, as last amended by chapter 517, Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page
107 3507) Section 21.7 of this bill removes the requirement for the Board of Directors
108 to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs.

30 section 10 of this act on or before June 30, 2035.
31 Sec. 5. NRS 534.120 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 534.120 1. Within an area that has been designated by the
33 State Engineer, as provided for in this chapter, where, in the
34 judgment of the State Engineer, the groundwater basin is being
35 depleted, the State Engineer in his or her administrative capacity
36 may make such rules, regulations and orders as are deemed essential
37 for the welfare of the area involved.
38 2. In the interest of public welfare, the State Engineer is
39 authorized and directed to designate preferred uses of water within
40 the respective areas so designated by the State Engineer and from
41 which the groundwater is being depleted, and in acting on
42 applications to appropriate groundwater, the State Engineer may
43 designate such preferred uses in different categories with respect to

36 dedication of the right to appropriate water is required by a local
37 ordinance.
38 5. In an area in which revocable permits have been issued
39 [temporary permits] pursuant to subsection 3, the State Engineer:
40 (a) Shall:
41 (1) Deny any applications to appropriate groundwater for use
42 in areas served by a public entity such as a water district or a

16 of a well-drilling rig.
17 6. For good and sufficient reasons, the State Engineer may
18 exempt the provisions of this section with respect to public housing
19 authorities.
20 7. The provisions of this section do not prohibit the State
21 Engineer from revoking a [temporary] revocable permit issued
22 pursuant to this section if any parcel served by a well pursuant to the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural
2 Resources to make grants to state agencies, local governments, water conservancy
3 districts, conservation districts and certain nonprofit organizations to protect,
4 preserve and obtain the benefits of the property and natural and cultural resources
5 of this State and requires the Director to adopt regulations to make such grants.
6 (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page
7 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
8 Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 8 of this bill creates
9 the Program in statute. Section 8 further provides that the Program consists of a
10 grant program to make such grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
11 Retirement Program. Section 14 of this bill provides that the Program is within the
12 Department. Section 13 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
13 the Department to the provisions of sections 8-10 of this bill.
14 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
15 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
16 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
17 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
18 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
19 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 9
20 creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the Director
21 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and requires that
22 the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or certificated
23 groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10 establishes the Nevada
24 Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and
25 Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director, and establishes
26 requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or certificated
27 groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of groundwater rights.
28 Section 10 also prohibits the Director from accepting donations and applications
29 for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater rights after June 30, 2035.
30 Section 21 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the Director may
31 not accept applications or donations after that date.
32 Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
33 certificated water rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water
34 Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any
35 groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the
36 groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
37 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which the rights
38 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
39 Program.
40 Section 25 of this bill provides for the provisions relating to the Account set
41 forth in section 9 to expire on June 30, 2035. Section 21 of this bill makes a
42 conforming change to reflect the expiration of these provisions.
43 Under existing law, the State Engineer may issue temporary permits to
44 appropriate groundwater in certain designated areas which may be revoked under
45 certain circumstances. In areas where these temporary permits have been issued, the
46 State Engineer is required to prohibit the drilling of wells for domestic use if water
47 can be furnished by a public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the
48 inhabitants of the area. (NRS 534.120) Sections 5, 6, 16 and 22 of this bill revise
49 references to these temporary permits to revocable permits.
50 Section 23 of this bill deems any such existing and valid temporary permit
51 issued by the State Engineer pursuant to existing law before July 1, 2025, to be a
52 revocable permit. Section 5 also requires the State Engineer to prohibit the drilling
53 of wells for domestic use if a property is within 1,250 feet of a service line of a
54 public entity presently engaged in furnishing water to the inhabitants of the area.

55 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
56 water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to water conservation
57 and capital improvements to water systems. Under this program, eligible recipients
58 may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
59 (NRS 349.981) Section 16 includes in the types of improvements for which an
60 eligible recipient could receive a grant: (1) the removal and replacement of grass
61 with water-efficient landscaping, under certain circumstances; and (2) the
62 permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes.
63 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to
64 provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects
65 that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the
66 average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section
67 17 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be
68 based upon the median household income of the customers of the recipient.
69 Existing law authorizes a district board of health to create a voluntary financial
70 assistance program to pay 100 percent of the costs for property owners with an
71 existing septic system whose property is served by a municipal water system to
72 connect to the community sewerage disposal system. (NRS 439.3672) Section 18
73 of this bill establishes certain requirements for a property owner to be eligible to
74 receive financial assistance from this program.
75 Existing law sets forth a legislative declaration relating to the right of the
76 people of this State to clean water and certain policies of this State related to this
77 right to clean water. (NRS 445A.305) Section 19 of this bill sets forth the policy of
78 this State to encourage and promote water reuse in an appropriate manner that is
79 consistent with public health.
80 Existing state law requires the State Environmental Commission to establish
81 water quality standards at a level designed to protect and ensure a continuation of
82 the designated beneficial use or uses for the stream segment or other body of
83 surface water that have been determined applicable by the Commission. (NRS
84 445A.520) Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a variance in the
85 water quality standard from the water quality standard determined to protect and
86 ensure a continuation of the designated beneficial use or uses if the state determines
87 that compliance with this standard is not feasible for certain reasons. (40 C.F.R. §
88 131.14) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish a water
89 quality standard variance in accordance with federal law.
90 The Conservation of Colorado River Water Act establishes certain provisions
91 relating to conserving the waters of the Colorado River, including requiring certain
92 parcels of property which use such waters to participate in an irrigation water
93 efficiency monitoring program. (Chapter 364, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
94 2179) The Act requires the Board of Directors of the Southern Nevada Water
95 Authority to: (1) establish deadlines for an owner of such a parcel of property to
96 begin participating in the program; and (2) notify the owner that he or she is
97 required to participate by not later than January 1, 2025. (Section 30 of chapter 210,
98 Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1283) Section 21.5 of this bill instead requires the
99 Board of Directors to notify the owner not less than 1 year before the program is
100 established.
101 Existing law authorizes the Southern Nevada Water Authority to create an
102 Advisory Committee for the Management of Groundwater in the Las Vegas Valley
103 Groundwater Basin. If a member appointed to the Committee resigns or is unable to
104 serve, the Board of Directors is required to appoint a person to fill the vacancy not
105 later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Section 8 of chapter 572, Statutes of
106 Nevada 1997, as last amended by chapter 517, Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page
107 3507) Section 21.7 of this bill removes the requirement for the Board of Directors
108 to fill the vacancy not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs.

– 5 –
1 submitted in proper form which contemplates the application of
2 water to beneficial use if:
3 (a) The application is accompanied by the prescribed fees;
4 (b) The proposed use or change, if within an irrigation district,
5 does not adversely affect the cost of water for other holders of water
6 rights in the district or lessen the efficiency of the district in its
7 delivery or use of water; and
8 (c) The applicant provides proof satisfactory to the State
9 Engineer of the applicant’s:
10 (1) Intention in good faith to construct any work necessary to
11 apply the water to the intended beneficial use with reasonable
12 diligence; and
13 (2) Financial ability and reasonable expectation actually to
14 construct the work and apply the water to the intended beneficial use
15 with reasonable diligence.
16 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 10, [where there]
17 the State Engineer shall reject an application and refuse to issue
18 the requested permit if:
19 (a) There is no unappropriated water in the proposed source of
20 supply [, where the] ;
21 (b) The groundwater that has not been committed for use has
22 been reserved pursuant to NRS 533.0241 ;
23 (c) The application requests a change to or reinstatement of
