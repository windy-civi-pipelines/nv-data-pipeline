AN ACT relating to animals; revising provisions governing acts
constituting torture or cruelty to animals; revising certain
penalties for acts of animal cruelty; revising certain
provisions governing the ownership and care of animals
treated cruelly; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, “torture” of or “cruelty” to an animal includes every act,
2 omission or neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is
3 caused or permitted. (NRS 574.050) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of
4 “torture” of or “cruelty” to animals to include every act, omission or neglect
5 whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused, allowed or
6 permitted. Section 1 of this bill provides that, for the purposes of determining
7 whether a person committed an act of torture or cruelty to an animal by allowing or
8 permitting the act to occur, the person: (1) allows the torture of or cruelty to occur
9 if the person does nothing to prevent or stop the torture or cruelty; and (2) permits
10 the torture or cruelty to occur if the person unreasonably approves, grants approval
11 or allows an act, omission or neglect to occur and which act, omission, or neglect
12 constitutes the torture of or cruelty to the animal.
13 Existing law requires certain officers to: (1) take possession of an animal which
14 is being treated cruelly; and (2) give to the owner a notice containing certain
15 information. Upon proof that proper notice has been given, existing law authorizes
16 a court of competent jurisdiction to order the animal sold at auction, humanely
17 destroyed or continued in the care of the officer. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 of this
18 bill removes the authorization for a court to order the animal sold at auction.

19 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the seizure and disposition
20 of an animal which an officer discovers is being treated cruelly does not apply to
21 any animal which is located on land being employed for an agricultural use. (NRS
22 574.055) Section 3 removes this exception.
23 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture or
24 cruelty to animals is guilty of a misdemeanor for a first offense, except if the
25 person: (1) willfully and maliciously engages in such an act, the person is guilty of
26 a category D felony; or (2) commits the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize
27 another person, the person is guilty of a category C felony. (NRS 574.100) Section
28 4 of this bill provides instead that: (1) a willful and malicious violation is a category
29 B felony if the act causes the death of the animal; (2) committing the act to
30 threaten, intimidate or terrorize another person is a category B felony; and (3) a
31 knowing or reckless violation is a category D violation.
32 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture of or
33 cruelty to a police animal is guilty of: (1) a category D felony if the police animal is
34 not totally disabled or killed; and (2) a category C felony if the police animal is
35 totally disabled or killed. (NRS 574.105) Section 5 of this bill increases these
36 penalties to a category C felony if the police animal is not totally disabled or killed
37 and a category B felony if the police animal is totally disabled or killed.
38 Existing law requires that if a person is lawfully arrested for certain crimes
39 against animals and an animal owned or possessed by the person is impounded by
40 the county, city or other local government in connection with the arrest, the person
41 must be notified of his or her right to request a hearing within 5 days. If the person
42 does not request a hearing, or if the owner of the animal has not been identified
43 within 5 days after the arrest, the county, city or other local government which
44 impounded the animal is required to transfer ownership of the animal to an animal
45 rescue organization, animal shelter or another person who is able to provide
46 adequate care and shelter to the animal. (NRS 574.203) Section 7 of this bill
47 provides instead that, if the arrested and detained person does not request a hearing,
48 or the owner of the animal has not been identified within 5 days after the arrest, the
49 animal must be forfeited to the county, city or other local government which took
50 possession of the animal, who must then transfer ownership of the animal to certain
51 entities which are able to provide adequate care and shelter to the animal.
