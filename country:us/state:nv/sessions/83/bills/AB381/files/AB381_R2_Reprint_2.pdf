EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to animals; revising provisions governing the
seizure of animals under certain circumstances; revising
certain penalties and remedies for acts of animal cruelty;
revising certain provisions governing the ownership and
care of animals treated cruelly; revising provisions
relating to immunity from civil liability for certain actions
taken to protect or remove a pet from a motor vehicle
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain officers to: (1) take possession of an animal which
2 is being treated cruelly and provide the animal with shelter and care or, with the
3 permission of the owner, humanely destroy the animal; and (2) give to the owner a
4 notice containing certain information. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 of this bill also
5 authorizes an officer that takes possession of an animal to destroy the animal in a
6 humane manner if: (1) the officer obtains an order from a court; or (2) a licensed
7 veterinarian, veterinarian technician or euthanasia technician examines the animal
8 and recommends that the animal be humanely destroyed.
9 Upon proof that proper notice has been given, existing law authorizes a court of
10 competent jurisdiction to order the animal sold at auction, humanely destroyed or
11 continued in the care of the officer. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 removes the
12 authorization for a court to order the animal sold at auction.

13 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the seizure and disposition
14 of an animal which an officer discovers is being treated cruelly does not apply to
15 any animal which is located on land being employed for an agricultural use. (NRS
16 574.055) Section 3 removes this exception.
17 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture or
18 cruelty to animals is guilty of a misdemeanor for a first offense, except if the
19 person: (1) willfully and maliciously engages in such an act, the person is guilty of
20 a category D felony; or (2) commits the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize
21 another person, the person is guilty of a category C felony. (NRS 574.100) Section
22 4 of this bill provides instead that a willful and malicious violation where the act
23 causes the death of the animal and committing the act to threaten, intimidate or
24 terrorize another person are both a category B felony, punishable by imprisonment
25 in the state prison for a minimum term of 1 year and a maximum term of 6 years.
26 Existing law prohibits the owner, possessor or person in charge or custody of a
27 maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal from abandoning the animal, leaving
28 the animal to die in certain public places or allowing the animal to lie in certain
29 public places for more than 3 hours after the person receives notice that the animal
30 is left disabled. A violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor. (NRS 574.110)
31 Existing law also prohibits a person from abandoning an animal in any other
32 circumstance, with certain exceptions for feral cats. A violation of this prohibition
33 is a misdemeanor that is subject to certain enhanced penalties under certain
34 circumstances. (NRS 574.100) Section 4 prohibits the abandonment of an animal in
35 all circumstances, with certain exceptions for feral cats. Section 15.5 of this bill
36 repeals the existing law relating to the abandonment of a maimed, diseased,
37 disabled or infirm animal. As a result of this change, the abandonment of an animal,
38 regardless of the health of the animal, is subject to the same penalties and penalty
39 enhancements.
40 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture of or
41 cruelty to a police animal is guilty of: (1) a category D felony if the police animal is
42 not totally disabled or killed; and (2) a category C felony if the police animal is
43 totally disabled or killed. (NRS 574.105) Section 5 of this bill increases these
44 penalties to a category B felony if the police animal is totally disabled or killed,
45 punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than
46 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 6 years.
47 Existing law sets forth the applicability of certain provisions relating to cruelty
48 to animals. (NRS 574.200) Section 6 of this bill provides that these provisions do
49 not prohibit providing humane relief to an animal to prevent the further suffering of
50 the animal when the animal is gravely injured.
51 Existing law requires that if a person is lawfully arrested for certain crimes
52 against animals and an animal owned or possessed by the person is impounded by
53 the county, city or other local government in connection with the arrest, the person
54 must be notified of his or her right to request a hearing within 5 days. If the person
55 does not request a hearing, or if the owner of the animal has not been identified
56 within 5 days after the arrest, the county, city or other local government which
57 impounded the animal is required to transfer ownership of the animal to an animal
58 rescue organization, animal shelter or another person who is able to provide
59 adequate care and shelter to the animal. (NRS 574.055, 574.203) Sections 3 and 7
60 of this bill require the owner to be notified of his or her right to request a hearing
61 within 7 calendar days after receiving the notice. Sections 3 and 7 also provide
62 that, if the arrested and detained person does not request a hearing, or the owner of
63 the animal has not been identified within 7 calendar days after the arrest, the animal
64 is forfeited to the county, city or other local government which took possession of
65 the animal, who must then dispose of the animal as the county, city or other local
66 government sees fit.

67 Existing law provides that the knowing, purposeful or reckless killing or
68 injuring of an animal may be an act that constitutes domestic violence. (NRS
69 33.018) Existing law authorizes a court, by a temporary order, to enjoin the adverse
70 party named in an application for an order for protection against domestic violence
71 from: (1) physically injuring, threatening to injure or taking possession of any
72 animal that is owned or kept by the applicant for the order or a minor child and any
73 animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party; and (2) physically injuring or
74 threatening to injure any animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party. Existing
75 law further authorizes the court, by extended order, to specify arrangements for the
76 possession and care of any animal owned or kept by the adverse party, applicant or
77 minor child. (NRS 33.030) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the court, by temporary
78 order, to enjoin the adverse party from taking possession of an animal that is owned
79 or kept by the adverse party.
80 Existing law requires, if a child is adjudicated delinquent for an unlawful act
81 that involves cruelty to or torture of an animal, the juvenile court to order the child
82 to participate in counseling or other psychological treatment. (NRS 62E.680)
83 Sections 1.9 and 9 of this bill require the juvenile court to order such a child to also
84 undergo a psychological evaluation.
85 Existing law provides that if a person is convicted for an unlawful act involving
86 animal cruelty, a court may order, as a condition of probation, the person to submit
87 to a psychiatric evaluation and participate in counseling or therapy. (NRS
88 176A.416) Sections 1.9 and 11 of this bill authorize a court to also order such a
89 person to participate in a rehabilitative or educational program.
90 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to
91 animal cruelty to the provisions of section 1.9.
92 Existing law prohibits a person from leaving a pet in a motor vehicle under
93 certain circumstances. (NRS 202.487) Existing law authorizes a peace officer, an
94 animal control officer, certain governmental officers and certain other persons to
95 use any reasonable means necessary to protect a pet left unattended in a motor
96 vehicle and to remove the pet from the motor vehicle without incurring civil
97 liability, under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.487) Section 14 of this bill
98 provides that a person who is immune from civil liability for taking such actions is
99 also immune from criminal liability. Section 14 also authorizes any other person to
100 whom existing law does not grant immunity from civil liability to use any
101 reasonable means necessary to protect a pet left unattended and to remove the pet
102 from the motor vehicle without incurring civil or criminal liability if the person: (1)
103 determines that the motor vehicle is locked or there is no other reasonable way to
104 protect the pet or remove the pet from the vehicle; (2) reports the violation to a law
105 enforcement agency or certain other governmental entities; (3) remains with the pet
106 until informed that his or her presence is no longer needed by such law enforcement
107 agency or other governmental entity; and (4) cooperates with certain persons who
108 respond to a request for assistance.
