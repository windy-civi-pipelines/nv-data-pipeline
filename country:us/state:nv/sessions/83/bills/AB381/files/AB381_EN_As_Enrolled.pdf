CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to animals; revising provisions governing the
seizure of animals under certain circumstances; revising
certain penalties and remedies for acts of animal cruelty;
revising certain provisions governing the ownership and care
of animals treated cruelly; revising provisions relating to
immunity from civil liability for certain actions taken to
protect or remove a pet from a motor vehicle under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain officers to: (1) take possession of an animal which
is being treated cruelly and provide the animal with shelter and care or, with the
permission of the owner, humanely destroy the animal; and (2) give to the owner a
notice containing certain information. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 of this bill also
authorizes an officer that takes possession of an animal to destroy the animal in a
humane manner if: (1) the officer obtains an order from a court; or (2) a licensed
veterinarian, veterinarian technician or euthanasia technician examines the animal
and recommends that the animal be humanely destroyed.
Upon proof that proper notice has been given, existing law authorizes a court of
competent jurisdiction to order the animal sold at auction, humanely destroyed or
continued in the care of the officer. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 removes the
authorization for a court to order the animal sold at auction.
Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the seizure and disposition
of an animal which an officer discovers is being treated cruelly does not apply to
any animal which is located on land being employed for an agricultural use. (NRS
574.055) Section 3 removes this exception.
Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture or
cruelty to animals is guilty of a misdemeanor for a first offense, except if the
person: (1) willfully and maliciously engages in such an act, the person is guilty of
a category D felony; or (2) commits the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize
another person, the person is guilty of a category C felony. (NRS 574.100) Section
4 of this bill provides instead that a willful and malicious violation where the act
causes the death of the animal and committing the act to threaten, intimidate or
terrorize another person are both a category B felony, punishable by imprisonment
in the state prison for a minimum term of 1 year and a maximum term of 6 years.
Existing law prohibits the owner, possessor or person in charge or custody of a
maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal from abandoning the animal, leaving
the animal to die in certain public places or allowing the animal to lie in certain
public places for more than 3 hours after the person receives notice that the animal
is left disabled. A violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor. (NRS 574.110)
Existing law also prohibits a person from abandoning an animal in any other
circumstance, with certain exceptions for feral cats. A violation of this prohibition
is a misdemeanor that is subject to certain enhanced penalties under certain
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
circumstances. (NRS 574.100) Section 4 prohibits the abandonment of an animal in
all circumstances, with certain exceptions for feral cats. Section 15.5 of this bill
repeals the existing law relating to the abandonment of a maimed, diseased,
disabled or infirm animal. As a result of this change, the abandonment of an animal,
regardless of the health of the animal, is subject to the same penalties and penalty
enhancements.
Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture of or
cruelty to a police animal is guilty of: (1) a category D felony if the police animal is
not totally disabled or killed; and (2) a category C felony if the police animal is
totally disabled or killed. (NRS 574.105) Section 5 of this bill increases these
penalties to a category B felony if the police animal is totally disabled or killed,
punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than
1 year and a maximum term of not more than 6 years.
Existing law sets forth the applicability of certain provisions relating to cruelty
to animals. (NRS 574.200) Section 6 of this bill provides that these provisions do
not prohibit providing humane relief to an animal to prevent the further suffering of
the animal when the animal is gravely injured.
Existing law requires that if a person is lawfully arrested for certain crimes
against animals and an animal owned or possessed by the person is impounded by
the county, city or other local government in connection with the arrest, the person
must be notified of his or her right to request a hearing within 5 days. If the person
does not request a hearing, or if the owner of the animal has not been identified
within 5 days after the arrest, the county, city or other local government which
impounded the animal is required to transfer ownership of the animal to an animal
rescue organization, animal shelter or another person who is able to provide
adequate care and shelter to the animal. (NRS 574.055, 574.203) Sections 3 and 7
of this bill require the owner to be notified of his or her right to request a hearing
within 7 calendar days after receiving the notice. Sections 3 and 7 also provide
that, if the arrested and detained person does not request a hearing, or the owner of
the animal has not been identified within 7 calendar days after the arrest, the animal
is forfeited to the county, city or other local government which took possession of
the animal, who must then dispose of the animal as the county, city or other local
government sees fit.
Existing law provides that the knowing, purposeful or reckless killing or
injuring of an animal may be an act that constitutes domestic violence. (NRS
33.018) Existing law authorizes a court, by a temporary order, to enjoin the adverse
party named in an application for an order for protection against domestic violence
from: (1) physically injuring, threatening to injure or taking possession of any
animal that is owned or kept by the applicant for the order or a minor child and any
animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party; and (2) physically injuring or
threatening to injure any animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party. Existing
law further authorizes the court, by extended order, to specify arrangements for the
possession and care of any animal owned or kept by the adverse party, applicant or
minor child. (NRS 33.030) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the court, by temporary
order, to enjoin the adverse party from taking possession of an animal that is owned
or kept by the adverse party.
Existing law requires, if a child is adjudicated delinquent for an unlawful act
that involves cruelty to or torture of an animal, the juvenile court to order the child
to participate in counseling or other psychological treatment. (NRS 62E.680)
Sections 1.9 and 9 of this bill require the juvenile court to order such a child to also
undergo a psychological evaluation.
Existing law provides that if a person is convicted for an unlawful act involving
animal cruelty, a court may order, as a condition of probation, the person to submit
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
to a psychiatric evaluation and participate in counseling or therapy. (NRS
176A.416) Sections 1.9 and 11 of this bill authorize a court to also order such a
person to participate in a rehabilitative or educational program.
Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to
animal cruelty to the provisions of section 1.9.
Existing law prohibits a person from leaving a pet in a motor vehicle under
certain circumstances. (NRS 202.487) Existing law authorizes a peace officer, an
animal control officer, certain governmental officers and certain other persons to
use any reasonable means necessary to protect a pet left unattended in a motor
vehicle and to remove the pet from the motor vehicle without incurring civil
liability, under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.487) Section 14 of this bill
provides that a person who is immune from civil liability for taking such actions is
also immune from criminal liability. Section 14 also authorizes any other person to
whom existing law does not grant immunity from civil liability to use any
reasonable means necessary to protect a pet left unattended and to remove the pet
from the motor vehicle without incurring civil or criminal liability if the person: (1)
determines that the motor vehicle is locked or there is no other reasonable way to
protect the pet or remove the pet from the vehicle; (2) reports the violation to a law
enforcement agency or certain other governmental entities; (3) remains with the pet
until informed that his or her presence is no longer needed by such law enforcement
agency or other governmental entity; and (4) cooperates with certain persons who
respond to a request for assistance.
