EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to animals; revising provisions governing the
seizure of animals under certain circumstances; revising
provisions governing acts constituting torture or cruelty to
animals; revising certain penalties and remedies for acts
of animal cruelty; authorizing a court to issue a temporary
restraining order against a person who commits certain
acts of animal cruelty; revising certain provisions
governing the ownership and care of animals treated

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, “torture” of or “cruelty” to an animal includes every act,
2 omission or neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is
3 caused or permitted. (NRS 574.050) Section 2 of this bill separates the definition of
4 “torture” of and “cruelty” to animals to provide that: (1) “cruelty” includes every
5 act, omission or neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death of
6 an animal is caused or permitted; and (2) “torture” means every act taken to inflict
7 on or prolong pain, suffering or death to an animal.
8 Section 1.6 of this bill authorizes a court to issue a temporary restraining order
9 against a person charged with committing certain unlawful acts of animal cruelty.
10 Existing law requires certain officers to: (1) take possession of an animal which
11 is being treated cruelly; and (2) give to the owner a notice containing certain
-
*AB381_R1*

– 2 –
12 information. Upon proof that proper notice has been given, existing law authorizes
13 a court of competent jurisdiction to order the animal sold at auction, humanely
14 destroyed or continued in the care of the officer. (NRS 574.055) Sections 1.2 and 3
15 of this bill reorganize these provisions. Section 1.2 further requires that, in a county
16 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), if an
17 officer takes possession of an animal being treated cruelly and determines that
18 immediate humane euthanasia of the animal may be necessary, a licensed
19 veterinarian must examine the animal and recommend the humane euthanasia of the
20 animal before the humane euthanasia may proceed. Section 14 of this bill makes a
21 conforming change to provide that a pet removed from a motor vehicle under
22 certain circumstances is an animal being treated cruelly for the purposes of taking
23 possession of the animal under section 1.2.
24 Section 3 removes the authorization for a court to order the animal sold at
25 auction.
26 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the seizure and disposition
27 of an animal which an officer discovers is being treated cruelly does not apply to
28 any animal which is located on land being employed for an agricultural use. (NRS
29 574.055) Section 3 removes this exception.
30 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture or
31 cruelty to animals is guilty of a misdemeanor for a first offense, except if the
32 person: (1) willfully and maliciously engages in such an act, the person is guilty of
33 a category D felony; or (2) commits the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize
34 another person, the person is guilty of a category C felony. (NRS 574.100) Section
35 1.4 of this bill provides instead that certain acts related to torture or the unjustifiable
36 maiming, mutilating or killing of certain animals is subject to enhanced penalties as
37 follows: (1) a knowing or reckless violation is a category D felony; (2) a willful and
38 malicious violation is a category C felony; (3) committing the act to threaten,
39 intimidate or terrorize another person is a category B felony, punishable by
40 imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of 1 year and a maximum
41 term of 6 years. Additionally, section 1.4 provides that the following willful and
42 malicious violations are subject to enhanced penalties: (1) restraining a dog in
43 certain manners is, with certain exceptions, a gross misdemeanor; (2) abandoning
44 an animal in certain circumstances is a category C felony; and (3) committing
45 certain acts of animal cruelty to an animal which causes the death of the animal is a
46 category B felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum
47 term of 1 year and a maximum term of 6 years and a fine of not more than $10,000.
48 Sections 10, 12, 13 and 15, respectively, of this bill provide that a person who
49 has received an enhanced sentence for such acts of animal cruelty: (1) may not
50 receive a deferred judgment from the court; (2) is subject to a maximum period of
51 probation or suspension of a sentence of 60 months; (3) is not eligible for the
52 Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety to petition a
53 court to recommend the early discharge of the person from probation; and (4) is not
54 eligible to have certain credits deducted from the minimum term or minimum
55 aggregate term imposed by his or her sentence of judgment.
56 Section 4 of this bill provides that it is an affirmative defense to a violation of
57 certain acts of animal cruelty if the person reasonably believes that the person was
58 engaging in the reasonable discipline of the animal.
59 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture of or
60 cruelty to a police animal is guilty of: (1) a category D felony if the police animal is
61 not totally disabled or killed; and (2) a category C felony if the police animal is
62 totally disabled or killed. (NRS 574.105) Section 5 of this bill increases these
63 penalties to a category C felony if the police animal is not totally disabled or killed
64 and a category B felony if the police animal is totally disabled or killed.
65 Existing law prohibits the owner, possessor or person in charge or custody of a
66 maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal from abandoning the animal, leaving
-
*AB381_R1*

– 3 –
67 the animal to die in certain public places or allowing the animal to lie in certain
68 public places for more than 3 hours after the person receives notice that the animal
69 is left disabled. A violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor. (NRS 574.110)
70 Section 5.5 of this bill instead prohibits the intentional abandonment or leaving to
71 die of any animal, including a maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal, by such
72 a person and makes a violation of this prohibition a gross misdemeanor.
73 Existing law sets forth the applicability of certain provisions relating to cruelty
74 to animals. (NRS 574.200) Section 6 of this bill provides that these provisions do
75 not prohibit the humane euthanasia of an animal by a veterinarian, veterinarian
76 technician or euthanasia technician if such a person determines that humane
77 euthanasia is necessary to end the intractable suffering of an animal.
78 Existing law requires that if a person is lawfully arrested for certain crimes
79 against animals and an animal owned or possessed by the person is impounded by
80 the county, city or other local government in connection with the arrest, the person
81 must be notified of his or her right to request a hearing within 5 days. If the person
82 does not request a hearing, or if the owner of the animal has not been identified
83 within 5 days after the arrest, the county, city or other local government which
84 impounded the animal is required to transfer ownership of the animal to an animal
85 rescue organization, animal shelter or another person who is able to provide
86 adequate care and shelter to the animal. (NRS 574.055, 574.203) Sections 3 and 7
87 of this bill require the owner to be notified of his or her right to request a hearing
88 within 5 business days after receiving the notice. Sections 3 and 7 also provide
89 that, if the arrested and detained person does not request a hearing, or the owner of
90 the animal has not been identified within 5 business days after the arrest, the animal
91 must be forfeited to the county, city or other local government which took
92 possession of the animal, who must then dispose of the animal as the county, city or
93 other local government sees fit.
94 Section 1.8 of this bill requires a court to order a person convicted of certain
95 unlawful acts of animal cruelty to pay restitution for all costs associated with the
96 care, impoundment and disposition of the animal of which a county, city or other
97 local government takes possession.
98 Existing law provides that the knowing, purposeful or reckless killing or
99 injuring of an animal may be an act that constitutes domestic violence. (NRS
100 33.018) Existing law authorizes a court, by a temporary order, to enjoin the adverse
101 party named in an application for an order for protection against domestic violence
102 from: (1) physically injuring, threatening to injure or taking possession of any
103 animal that is owned or kept by the applicant for the order or a minor child and any
104 animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party; and (2) physically injuring or
105 threatening to injure any animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party. Existing
106 law further authorizes the court, by extended order, to specify arrangements for the
107 possession and care of any animal owned or kept by the adverse party, applicant or
108 minor child. (NRS 33.030) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the court, by temporary
109 order, to enjoin the adverse party from taking possession of an animal that is owned
110 or kept by the adverse party.
111 Existing law requires, if a child is adjudicated delinquent for an unlawful act
112 that involves cruelty to or torture of an animal, the juvenile court to order the child
113 to participate in counseling or other psychological treatment. (NRS 62E.680)
114 Sections 1.9 and 9 of this bill require the juvenile court to order such a child to also
115 undergo a psychological evaluation.
116 Existing law provides that if a person is convicted for an unlawful act involving
117 animal cruelty, a court may order, as a condition of probation, the person to submit
118 to a psychiatric evaluation and participate in counseling or therapy. (NRS
119 176A.416) Sections 1.9 and 11 of this bill authorize a court to also order such a
120 person to participate in a rehabilitative or educational program.
