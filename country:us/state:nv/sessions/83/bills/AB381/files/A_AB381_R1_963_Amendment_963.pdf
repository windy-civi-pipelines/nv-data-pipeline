AN ACT relating to animals; revising provisions governing the seizure of animals
under certain circumstances; [revising provisions governing acts
constituting torture or cruelty to animals;] revising certain penalties
and remedies for acts of animal cruelty; [authorizing a court to issue a
temporary restraining order against a person who commits certain acts
of animal cruelty;] revising certain provisions governing the ownership
and care of animals treated cruelly; revising provisions relating to
immunity from civil liability for certain actions taken to protect or

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Under existing law, “torture” of or “cruelty” to an animal includes every act, omission or
2 neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted. (NRS
3 574.050) Section 2 of this bill separates the definition of “torture” of and “cruelty” to animals
4 to provide that: (1) “cruelty” includes every act, omission or neglect, whereby unjustifiable
5 physical pain, suffering or death of an animal is caused or permitted; and (2) “torture” means
6 every act taken to inflict on or prolong pain, suffering or death to an animal.
7 Section 1.6 of this bill authorizes a court to issue a temporary restraining order against a
8 person charged with committing certain unlawful acts of animal cruelty.]
9 Existing law requires certain officers to: (1) take possession of an animal which is being
10 treated cruelly [;] and provide the animal with shelter and care or, with the permission of
11 the owner, humanely destroy the animal; and (2) give to the owner a notice containing
12 certain information. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 of this bill also authorizes an officer that
13 takes possession of an animal to destroy the animal in a humane manner if: (1) the
14 officer obtains an order from a court; or (2) a licensed veterinarian, veterinarian
15 technician or euthanasia technician examines the animal and recommends that the
16 animal be humanely destroyed.

Senate Amendment No. 963 to Assembly Bill No. 381 First Reprint Page 4
17 Upon proof that proper notice has been given, existing law authorizes a court of
18 competent jurisdiction to order the animal sold at auction, humanely destroyed or continued in
19 the care of the officer. (NRS 574.055) [Sections 1.2 and] Section 3 [of this bill reorganize
20 these provisions. Section 1.2 further requires that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or
21 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), if an officer takes possession of an animal being
22 treated cruelly and determines that immediate humane euthanasia of the animal may be
23 necessary, a licensed veterinarian must examine the animal and recommend the humane
24 euthanasia of the animal before the humane euthanasia may proceed. Section 14 of this bill
25 makes a conforming change to provide that a pet removed from a motor vehicle under certain
26 circumstances is an animal being treated cruelly for the purposes of taking possession of the
27 animal under section 1.2.
28 Section 3] removes the authorization for a court to order the animal sold at auction.
29 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the seizure and disposition of an
30 animal which an officer discovers is being treated cruelly does not apply to any animal which
31 is located on land being employed for an agricultural use. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 removes
32 this exception.
33 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture or cruelty to
34 animals is guilty of a misdemeanor for a first offense, except if the person: (1) willfully and
35 maliciously engages in such an act, the person is guilty of a category D felony; or (2) commits
36 the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize another person, the person is guilty of a category C
37 felony. (NRS 574.100) Section [1.4] 4 of this bill provides instead that [certain acts related to
38 torture or the unjustifiable maiming, mutilating or killing of certain animals is subject to
39 enhanced penalties as follows: (1) a knowing or reckless violation is a category D felony; (2)]
40 a willful and malicious violation [is a category C felony ; (3)] where the act causes the death
41 of the animal and committing the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize another person [is]
42 are both a category B felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum
43 term of 1 year and a maximum term of 6 years. [Additionally, section 1.4 provides that the
44 following willful and malicious violations are subject to enhanced penalties: (1) restraining a
45 dog in certain manners is, with certain exceptions, a gross misdemeanor; (2) abandoning an
46 animal in certain circumstances is a category C felony; and (3) committing certain acts of
47 animal cruelty to an animal which causes the death of the animal is a category B felony,
48 punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of 1 year and a maximum
49 term of 6 years and a fine of not more than $10,000.
50 Sections 10, 12, 13 and 15, respectively, of this bill provide that a person who has
51 received an enhanced sentence for such acts of animal cruelty: (1) may not receive a deferred
52 judgment from the court; (2) is subject to a maximum period of probation or suspension of a
53 sentence of 60 months; (3) is not eligible for the Division of Parole and Probation of the
54 Department of Public Safety to petition a court to recommend the early discharge of the
55 person from probation; and (4) is not eligible to have certain credits deducted from the
56 minimum term or minimum aggregate term imposed by his or her sentence of judgment.]
57 Existing law prohibits the owner, possessor or person in charge or custody of a
58 maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal from abandoning the animal, leaving the
59 animal to die in certain public places or allowing the animal to lie in certain public
60 places for more than 3 hours after the person receives notice that the animal is left
61 disabled. A violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor. (NRS 574.110) Existing law
62 also prohibits a person from abandoning an animal in any other circumstance, with
63 certain exceptions for feral cats. A violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor that is
64 subject to certain enhanced penalties under certain circumstances. (NRS 574.100)
65 Section 4 [of this bill provides that it is an affirmative defense to a violation of certain acts of
66 animal cruelty if the person reasonably believes that the person was engaging in the
67 reasonable discipline of the animal.] prohibits the abandonment of an animal in all
68 circumstances, with certain exceptions for feral cats. Section 15.5 of this bill repeals the
69 existing law relating to the abandonment of a maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm
70 animal. As a result of this change, the abandonment of an animal, regardless of the
71 health of the animal, is subject to the same penalties and penalty enhancements.
72 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture of or cruelty to
73 a police animal is guilty of: (1) a category D felony if the police animal is not totally disabled
74 or killed; and (2) a category C felony if the police animal is totally disabled or killed. (NRS
75 574.105) Section 5 of this bill increases these penalties to a [category C felony if the police

Senate Amendment No. 963 to Assembly Bill No. 381 First Reprint Page 5
76 animal is not totally disabled or killed and a] category B felony if the police animal is totally
77 disabled or killed [.
78 Existing law prohibits the owner, possessor or person in charge or custody of a maimed,
79 diseased, disabled or infirm animal from abandoning the animal, leaving the animal to die in
80 certain public places or allowing the animal to lie in certain public places for more than 3
81 hours after the person receives notice that the animal is left disabled. A violation of this
82 prohibition is a misdemeanor. (NRS 574.110) Section 5.5 of this bill instead prohibits the
83 intentional abandonment or leaving to die of any animal, including a maimed, diseased,
84 disabled or infirm animal, by such a person and makes a violation of this prohibition a gross
85 misdemeanor.] , punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of
86 not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 6 years.
87 Existing law sets forth the applicability of certain provisions relating to cruelty to
88 animals. (NRS 574.200) Section 6 of this bill provides that these provisions do not prohibit
89 [the] providing humane [euthanasia of] relief to an animal [by a veterinarian, veterinarian
90 technician or euthanasia technician if such a person determines that humane euthanasia is
91 necessary to end the intractable] to prevent the further suffering of [an] the animal [.] when
92 the animal is gravely injured.
93 Existing law requires that if a person is lawfully arrested for certain crimes against
94 animals and an animal owned or possessed by the person is impounded by the county, city or
95 other local government in connection with the arrest, the person must be notified of his or her
96 right to request a hearing within 5 days. If the person does not request a hearing, or if the
97 owner of the animal has not been identified within 5 days after the arrest, the county, city or
98 other local government which impounded the animal is required to transfer ownership of the
99 animal to an animal rescue organization, animal shelter or another person who is able to
100 provide adequate care and shelter to the animal. (NRS 574.055, 574.203) Sections 3 and 7 of
101 this bill require the owner to be notified of his or her right to request a hearing within [5
102 business] 7 calendar days after receiving the notice. Sections 3 and 7 also provide that, if the
103 arrested and detained person does not request a hearing, or the owner of the animal has not
104 been identified within [5 business] 7 calendar days after the arrest, the animal [must be] is
105 forfeited to the county, city or other local government which took possession of the animal,
106 who must then dispose of the animal as the county, city or other local government sees fit.
107 [Section 1.8 of this bill requires a court to order a person convicted of certain unlawful
108 acts of animal cruelty to pay restitution for all costs associated with the care, impoundment
109 and disposition of the animal of which a county, city or other local government takes
110 possession.]
111 Existing law provides that the knowing, purposeful or reckless killing or injuring of an
112 animal may be an act that constitutes domestic violence. (NRS 33.018) Existing law
113 authorizes a court, by a temporary order, to enjoin the adverse party named in an application
114 for an order for protection against domestic violence from: (1) physically injuring, threatening
115 to injure or taking possession of any animal that is owned or kept by the applicant for the
116 order or a minor child and any animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party; and (2)
117 physically injuring or threatening to injure any animal that is owned or kept by the adverse
118 party. Existing law further authorizes the court, by extended order, to specify arrangements for
119 the possession and care of any animal owned or kept by the adverse party, applicant or minor
120 child. (NRS 33.030) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the court, by temporary order, to enjoin
121 the adverse party from taking possession of an animal that is owned or kept by the adverse
122 party.
123 Existing law requires, if a child is adjudicated delinquent for an unlawful act that involves
124 cruelty to or torture of an animal, the juvenile court to order the child to participate in
125 counseling or other psychological treatment. (NRS 62E.680) Sections 1.9 and 9 of this bill
126 require the juvenile court to order such a child to also undergo a psychological evaluation.
127 Existing law provides that if a person is convicted for an unlawful act involving animal
128 cruelty, a court may order, as a condition of probation, the person to submit to a psychiatric
129 evaluation and participate in counseling or therapy. (NRS 176A.416) Sections 1.9 and 11 of
130 this bill authorize a court to also order such a person to participate in a rehabilitative or
131 educational program.
132 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to animal
133 cruelty to the provisions of section 1.9.

Senate Amendment No. 963 to Assembly Bill No. 381 First Reprint Page 6
134 Existing law prohibits a person from leaving a pet in a motor vehicle under certain
135 circumstances. (NRS 202.487) Existing law authorizes a peace officer, an animal control
136 officer, certain governmental officers and certain other persons to use any reasonable
137 means necessary to protect a pet left unattended in a motor vehicle and to remove the
138 pet from the motor vehicle without incurring civil liability, under certain circumstances.
139 (NRS 202.487) Section 14 of this bill provides that a person who is immune from civil
140 liability for taking such actions is also immune from criminal liability. Section 14 also
141 authorizes any other person to whom existing law does not grant immunity from civil
142 liability to use any reasonable means necessary to protect a pet left unattended and to
143 remove the pet from the motor vehicle without incurring civil or criminal liability if the
144 person: (1) determines that the motor vehicle is locked or there is no other reasonable
145 way to protect the pet or remove the pet from the vehicle; (2) reports the violation to a
146 law enforcement agency or certain other governmental entities; (3) remains with the pet
147 until informed that his or her presence is no longer needed by such law enforcement
148 agency or other governmental entity; and (4) cooperates with certain persons who
149 respond to a request for assistance.
