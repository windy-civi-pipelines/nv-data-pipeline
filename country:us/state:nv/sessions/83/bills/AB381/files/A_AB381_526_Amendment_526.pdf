AN ACT relating to animals; revising provisions governing the seizure of
animals under certain circumstances; revising provisions governing
acts constituting torture or cruelty to animals; revising certain penalties
and remedies for acts of animal cruelty; authorizing a court to issue
a temporary restraining order against a person who commits
certain acts of animal cruelty; revising certain provisions governing
the ownership and care of animals treated cruelly; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, “torture” of or “cruelty” to an animal includes every act, omission or
2 neglect, whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted. (NRS
3 574.050) Section 2 of this bill [revises] separates the definition of “torture” of [or] and
4 “cruelty” to animals to [include] provide that: (1) “cruelty” includes every act, omission or
5 neglect , whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death of an animal is caused [,
6 allowed] or permitted [. Section 1 of this bill provides that, for the purposes of determining
7 whether a person committed an] ; and (2) “torture” means every act [of torture or cruelty]
8 taken to inflict on or prolong pain, suffering or death to an animal . [by allowing or
9 permitting the act to occur, the person: (1) allows the torture of or cruelty to occur if the
10 person does nothing to prevent or stop the torture or cruelty; and (2) permits the torture or
11 cruelty to occur if the person unreasonably approves, grants approval or allows an act,
12 omission or neglect to occur and which act, omission, or neglect constitutes the torture of or
13 cruelty to the animal.]
14 Section 1.6 of this bill authorizes a court to issue a temporary restraining order
15 against a person charged with committing certain unlawful acts of animal cruelty.
16 Existing law requires certain officers to: (1) take possession of an animal which is being
17 treated cruelly; and (2) give to the owner a notice containing certain information. Upon proof
18 that proper notice has been given, existing law authorizes a court of competent jurisdiction to
19 order the animal sold at auction, humanely destroyed or continued in the care of the officer.
20 (NRS 574.055) Sections 1.2 and 3 of this bill reorganize these provisions. Section 1.2

Assembly Amendment No. 526 to Assembly Bill No. 381 Page 4
21 further requires that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark
22 and Washoe Counties), if an officer takes possession of an animal being treated cruelly
23 and determines that immediate humane euthanasia of the animal may be necessary, a
24 licensed veterinarian must examine the animal and recommend the humane euthanasia
25 of the animal before the humane euthanasia may proceed. Section 14 of this bill makes a
26 conforming change to provide that a pet removed from a motor vehicle under certain
27 circumstances is an animal being treated cruelly for the purposes of taking possession of
28 the animal under section 1.2.
29 Section 3 [of this bill] removes the authorization for a court to order the animal sold at
30 auction.
31 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the seizure and disposition of an
32 animal which an officer discovers is being treated cruelly does not apply to any animal which
33 is located on land being employed for an agricultural use. (NRS 574.055) Section 3 removes
34 this exception.
35 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture or cruelty to
36 animals is guilty of a misdemeanor for a first offense, except if the person: (1) willfully and
37 maliciously engages in such an act, the person is guilty of a category D felony; or (2) commits
38 the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize another person, the person is guilty of a category C
39 felony. (NRS 574.100) Section [4] 1.4 of this bill provides instead that [:] certain acts
40 related to torture or the unjustifiable maiming, mutilating or killing of certain animals is
41 subject to enhanced penalties as follows: (1) a knowing or reckless violation is a category
42 D felony; (2) a willful and malicious violation is a category [B] C felony [if the act causes the
43 death of the animal; (2)] ; (3) committing the act to threaten, intimidate or terrorize another
44 person is a category B felony [; and (3) a knowing or reckless violation] , punishable by
45 imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of 1 year and a maximum term of
46 6 years. Additionally, section 1.4 provides that the following willful and malicious
47 violations are subject to enhanced penalties: (1) restraining a dog in certain manners is ,
48 with certain exceptions, a gross misdemeanor; (2) abandoning an animal in certain
49 circumstances is a category C felony; and (3) committing certain acts of animal cruelty
50 to an animal which causes the death of the animal is a category [D violation.] B felony,
51 punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of 1 year and a
52 maximum term of 6 years and a fine of not more than $10,000.
53 Sections 10, 12, 13 and 15, respectively, of this bill provide that a person who has
54 received an enhanced sentence for such acts of animal cruelty: (1) may not receive a
55 deferred judgment from the court; (2) is subject to a maximum period of probation or
56 suspension of a sentence of 60 months; (3) is not eligible for the Division of Parole and
57 Probation of the Department of Public Safety to petition a court to recommend the early
58 discharge of the person from probation; and (4) is not eligible to have certain credits
59 deducted from the minimum term or minimum aggregate term imposed by his or her
60 sentence of judgment.
61 Section 4 of this bill provides that it is an affirmative defense to a violation of certain
62 acts of animal cruelty if the person reasonably believes that the person was engaging in
63 the reasonable discipline of the animal.
64 Existing law provides that a person who engages in certain acts of torture of or cruelty to
65 a police animal is guilty of: (1) a category D felony if the police animal is not totally disabled
66 or killed; and (2) a category C felony if the police animal is totally disabled or killed. (NRS
67 574.105) Section 5 of this bill increases these penalties to a category C felony if the police
68 animal is not totally disabled or killed and a category B felony if the police animal is totally
69 disabled or killed.
70 Existing law prohibits the owner, possessor or person in charge or custody of a
71 maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal from abandoning the animal, leaving the
72 animal to die in certain public places or allowing the animal to lie in certain public
73 places for more than 3 hours after the person receives notice that the animal is left
74 disabled. A violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor. (NRS 574.110) Section 5.5 of
75 this bill instead prohibits the intentional abandonment or leaving to die of any animal,
76 including a maimed, diseased, disabled or infirm animal, by such a person and makes a
77 violation of this prohibition a gross misdemeanor.
78 Existing law sets forth the applicability of certain provisions relating to cruelty to
79 animals. (NRS 574.200) Section 6 of this bill provides that these provisions do not

Assembly Amendment No. 526 to Assembly Bill No. 381 Page 5
80 prohibit the humane euthanasia of an animal by a veterinarian, veterinarian technician
81 or euthanasia technician if such a person determines that humane euthanasia is
82 necessary to end the intractable suffering of an animal.
83 Existing law requires that if a person is lawfully arrested for certain crimes against
84 animals and an animal owned or possessed by the person is impounded by the county, city or
85 other local government in connection with the arrest, the person must be notified of his or her
86 right to request a hearing within 5 days. If the person does not request a hearing, or if the
87 owner of the animal has not been identified within 5 days after the arrest, the county, city or
88 other local government which impounded the animal is required to transfer ownership of the
89 animal to an animal rescue organization, animal shelter or another person who is able to
90 provide adequate care and shelter to the animal. (NRS 574.055, 574.203) [Section] Sections 3
91 and 7 of this bill require the owner to be notified of his or her right to request a hearing
92 within 5 business days after receiving the notice. Sections 3 and 7 [of this bill provides
93 instead] also provide that, if the arrested and detained person does not request a hearing, or
94 the owner of the animal has not been identified within 5 business days after the arrest, the
95 animal must be forfeited to the county, city or other local government which took possession
96 of the animal, who must then [transfer ownership] dispose of the animal [to certain entities
97 which are able to provide adequate care and shelter to the animal.] as the county, city or
98 other local government sees fit.
99 Section 1.8 of this bill requires a court to order a person convicted of certain
100 unlawful acts of animal cruelty to pay restitution for all costs associated with the care,
101 impoundment and disposition of the animal of which a county, city or other local
102 government takes possession.
103 Existing law provides that the knowing, purposeful or reckless killing or injuring of
104 an animal may be an act that constitutes domestic violence. (NRS 33.018) Existing law
105 authorizes a court, by a temporary order, to enjoin the adverse party named in an
106 application for an order for protection against domestic violence from: (1) physically
107 injuring, threatening to injure or taking possession of any animal that is owned or kept
108 by the applicant for the order or a minor child and any animal that is owned or kept by
109 the adverse party; and (2) physically injuring or threatening to injure any animal that is
110 owned or kept by the adverse party. Existing law further authorizes the court, by
111 extended order, to specify arrangements for the possession and care of any animal
112 owned or kept by the adverse party, applicant or minor child. (NRS 33.030) Section 8 of
113 this bill authorizes the court, by temporary order, to enjoin the adverse party from
114 taking possession of an animal that is owned or kept by the adverse party.
115 Existing law requires, if a child is adjudicated delinquent for an unlawful act that
116 involves cruelty to or torture of an animal, the juvenile court to order the child to
117 participate in counseling or other psychological treatment. (NRS 62E.680) Sections 1.9
118 and 9 of this bill require the juvenile court to order such a child to also undergo a
119 psychological evaluation.
120 Existing law provides that if a person is convicted for an unlawful act involving
121 animal cruelty, a court may order, as a condition of probation, the person to submit to a
122 psychiatric evaluation and participate in counseling or therapy. (NRS 176A.416)
123 Sections 1.9 and 11 of this bill authorize a court to also order such a person to
124 participate in a rehabilitative or educational program.

1 2. Permits the torture of or cruelty to an animal to occur if the person
2 approves, grants approval or allows an act, omission or neglect to occur in

22 injured or diseased to such an extent that it is probable the animal cannot
23 recover, a licensed veterinarian must examine the animal and recommend the
24 humane euthanasia of the animal before the humane euthanasia may proceed.
25 3. A county, city or other local government that takes possession of an
26 animal from an officer pursuant to this section has a lien on the animal for the

27 months for a violent or sexual offense as defined in NRS 202.876, a violation of
28 NRS 200.508 or a violation of NRS 574.100 or 574.110 that is punishable pursuant
29 to [subsection 6 of that] section [.] 1.4 of this act.
30 2. The court may extend the period of probation or suspension of sentence
31 ordered pursuant to subsection 1 for a period of not more than 12 months if such an
32 extension is necessary for the defendant to complete his or her participation in a
33 specialty court program.
34 3. At any time during probation or suspension of sentence, the court may
35 issue a warrant for violating any of the conditions of probation or suspension of
36 sentence and cause the defendant to be arrested. Except for the purpose of giving a
37 dishonorable discharge from probation, and except as otherwise provided in this
38 subsection, the time during which a warrant for violating any of the conditions of
39 probation is in effect is not part of the period of probation. If the warrant is
40 cancelled or probation is reinstated, the court may include any amount of that time
41 as part of the period of probation.
42 4. Any parole and probation officer or any peace officer with power to arrest
43 may arrest a probationer without a warrant, or may deputize any other officer with
44 power to arrest to do so by giving the probationer a written statement setting forth
45 that the probationer has, in the judgment of the parole and probation officer,
46 violated the conditions of probation. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5,
47 the parole and probation officer or the peace officer, after making an arrest, shall
48 present to the detaining authorities, if any, a statement of the charges against the
49 probationer. The parole and probation officer shall at once notify the court which
50 granted probation of the arrest and detention or residential confinement of the
51 probationer and shall submit a report in writing showing in what manner the
52 probationer has violated the conditions of probation.

Assembly Amendment No. 526 to Assembly Bill No. 381 Page 18
1 5. A parole and probation officer or a peace officer may immediately release
2 from custody without any further proceedings any person the officer arrests without
3 a warrant for violating a condition of probation if the parole and probation officer
4 or peace officer determines that there is no probable cause to believe that the person
5 violated the condition of probation.
6 6. A person who is sentenced to serve a period of probation for a felony or a
7 gross misdemeanor must be allowed for the period of the probation a deduction of:
8 (a) Ten days from that period for each month the person serves and is current
9 with any fee to defray the costs of his or her supervision charged by the Division of
10 Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety pursuant to NRS 213.1076
11 and with any payment of restitution ordered by the court, including, without
12 limitation, any payment of restitution required pursuant to NRS 176A.430. A
13 person shall be deemed to be current with any such fee and payment of restitution
14 for any given month if, during that month, the person makes at least the minimum
15 monthly payment established by the court or, if the court does not establish a
16 minimum monthly payment, by the Division.
17 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, 10 days from that period for
18 each month the person serves and is actively involved in employment or enrolled in
19 a program of education, rehabilitation or any other program approved by the
20 Division.
21 7. A person must be allowed a deduction pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of
22 subsection 6 regardless of whether the person has satisfied the requirements of the
23 other paragraph and must be allowed a deduction pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b)
24 of subsection 6 if the person has satisfied the requirements of both paragraphs of
25 that subsection.
26 8. A person who is sentenced to serve a period of probation for a felony or a
27 gross misdemeanor and who is a participant in a specialty court program must be
28 allowed a deduction from the period of probation for being actively involved in
29 employment or enrolled in a program of education, rehabilitation or any other
30 program approved by the Division only if the person successfully completes the
31 specialty court program. Such a deduction must not exceed the length of time
32 remaining on the person’s period of probation.
33 Sec. 13. NRS 176A.840 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 176A.840 1. The Division shall petition the court to recommend the early
35 discharge of a person from probation if the person:
36 (a) Has not violated any condition of probation during the immediately
37 preceding 12 months;
38 (b) Is current with any fee to defray the costs of his or her supervision charged
39 by the Division pursuant to NRS 213.1076;

48 574.110 that is punishable pursuant to [subsection 6 of that] section [.] 1.4 of this
49 act.
50 2. This section must not be construed to prohibit the court from allowing the
51 early discharge of a person from probation if the person does not meet the
52 requirements set forth in subsection 1.
53 Sec. 14. NRS 202.487 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Assembly Amendment No. 526 to Assembly Bill No. 381 Page 19

29 to take possession of a pet removed pursuant to this section may take any action
30 relating to the pet specified in section 1.2 of this act or NRS 574.055 and is entitled
31 to any lien or immunity from liability that is applicable pursuant to [that section.]
32 those sections.
33 5. The provisions of this section do not:
34 (a) Interfere with or prohibit any activity, law or right specified in NRS
35 574.200; or
36 (b) Apply to a person who unintentionally locks a motor vehicle with a pet in

8 serves.
9 2. In addition to the credits allowed pursuant to subsection 1, the Director

3 more than 58 percent for an offender who:
4 (a) Is serving a sentence for an offense committed on or after July 1, 2014; or
