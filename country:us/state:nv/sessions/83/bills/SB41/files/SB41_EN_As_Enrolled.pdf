Revenue and Economic Development
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring a cannabis tax permit issued
by the Department of Taxation to engage in or conduct the
business of selling cannabis or cannabis products; providing
for the issuance, revocation and suspension of a cannabis tax
permit; requiring the suspension of a cannabis license under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes an excise tax on the wholesale and retail sale of cannabis
by certain licensed cannabis establishments. (NRS 372A.290) Existing law also
requires any person engaged in the business of selling at retail tangible personal
property, including, without limitation, adult-use cannabis retail stores and cannabis
consumption lounges, to register or file an application for a permit for each place of
business from the Department of Taxation, which is referred to as a sales tax
permit. (NRS 360.5971)
Sections 3-5 of this bill define certain terms relating to the taxation of the sale
of cannabis. Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires that, in addition to any other permit
required by law, including, without limitation, a sales tax permit, every person who
desires to engage in the sale of cannabis or cannabis products must, before
obtaining a license from the Cannabis Compliance Board, apply for and obtain a
cannabis tax permit issued by the Department for each place of business; and (2)
establishes requirements for the application. Section 15 of this bill make this
requirement applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, and section 14 of this bill
establishes the manner in which persons engaging in the business of selling
cannabis or cannabis products before that date are required to comply with the
requirement to obtain a cannabis tax permit before that date.
Section 7 of this bill requires the Department, not later than 15 days after
receiving an application, to grant and issue to an applicant a separate cannabis tax
permit for each place of business and provide the applicant with a full written
explanation of the liability for the collection and payment of any applicable taxes.
Section 7 also provides that a cannabis tax permit is not assignable and is only
valid for the transaction of business at the place of business designated in the
permit.
Section 8 of this bill establishes procedures for the Department to revoke or
suspend a cannabis tax permit for failure to comply with certain requirements
relating to excise taxes imposed on the sale of cannabis and cannabis products.
Specifically, section 8: (1) requires the Department to provide to the holder of a
cannabis tax permit certain information concerning any alleged noncompliance, and
an opportunity to cure such noncompliance, before issuing a notice of a hearing for
the revocation or suspension of the cannabis tax permit; (2) authorizes the
Department to, after notice and a hearing, revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit
for such noncompliance; (3) provides for an appeal to the Nevada Tax
Commission; and (4) requires the Department to send a copy of a final decision to
revoke or suspend a permit to the Board.
Section 9 of this bill requires an aggrieved person to pay the amount of the tax
liability, or to enter into an agreement to pay the liability, before the person may
seek judicial review of a final decision of the Commission.

Section 9.5 of this bill establishes provisions for a holder of a license issued by
the Board who has requested to transfer the license to request and receive from the
Department a certificate of the amount of any delinquent excise taxes, and the
penalties and interest relating thereto.
Sections 10-12 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) indicate the proper
placement of sections 2-9.5 in the Nevada Revised Statutes; and (2) clarify that
certain provisions of existing law apply to sections 2-9.5.
Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in business as a cannabis
establishment, which includes the sale of cannabis or cannabis products, unless the
person holds a license from the Board. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678B.530)
Section 13 of this bill requires the Board, upon receipt of a copy of a final decision
to revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit or a sales and use tax permit, to suspend
the corresponding cannabis license of the cannabis establishment until the excise
tax liability is paid in full.

hearing of which the person was given prior notice of at least 10
days in writing specifying the time and place of the hearing and
requiring the person to show cause as to why his or her cannabis

6. Within 30 days after the date of service of a decision
pursuant to subsection 3, a person who is aggrieved by the
