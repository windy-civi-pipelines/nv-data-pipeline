SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the taxation of
cannabis establishments. (BDR 32-284)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; defining certain terms relating to the
taxation of the sale of cannabis; requiring a cannabis tax
permit to engage in the sale of cannabis; providing for the
revocation and suspension of a cannabis tax permit;
requiring the suspension of a cannabis license under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the wholesale and retail sale of cannabis
2 by certain licensed cannabis establishments. (NRS 372A.290) Existing law also
3 requires any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property,
4 which includes adult-use cannabis retail stores and cannabis consumption lounges,
5 to register or file an application for a permit for each place of business from the
6 Department of Taxation. (NRS 360.5971)
7 Sections 3-5 of this bill define certain terms relating to the taxation of the sale
8 of cannabis. Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires, in addition to any other permit
9 required by law, every person who holds a license from the Cannabis Compliance
10 Board who desires to engage in the sale of cannabis of any kind to apply for a
11 cannabis tax permit issued by the Department for each place of business; and (2)
12 establishes requirements for the application.
13 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department to grant and issue to an applicant
14 a separate cannabis tax permit for each place of business and provide the applicant
15 with a full written explanation of the liability for the collection and payment of any
16 applicable taxes. Section 7 also provides that a cannabis tax permit is not
-
*SB41*
– 2 –
17 assignable and is only valid for the transaction of business at the place of business
18 designated in the permit.
19 Section 8 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Department to, after notice and a
20 hearing, revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit for failure to comply with any
21 applicable provision of state law or regulation of the Department governing
22 taxation; (2) provides for an appeal to the Nevada Tax Commission; and (3)
23 requires the Department to send a copy of a final decision to revoke or suspend a
24 permit to the Cannabis Compliance Board.
25 Section 9 of this bill requires an aggrieved person to pay the amount of the tax
26 liability, or to enter into an agreement to pay the liability, before the person may
27 seek judicial review of a final decision of the Commission. Sections 10-12 of this
28 bill make conforming changes to: (1) indicate the proper placement of sections 2-9
29 in the Nevada Revised Statutes; and (2) clarify that certain provisions of existing
30 law apply to sections 2-9.
31 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in business as a cannabis
32 establishment, which includes the sale of cannabis or cannabis products, unless the
33 person holds a license from the Cannabis Compliance Board. (NRS 678B.210,
34 678B.250, 678B.530) Section 13 of this bill requires the Board, upon receipt of a
35 copy of a final decision provided pursuant to section 8, to suspend the
36 corresponding cannabis license of the cannabis establishment until the tax liability
37 is paid in full.
