EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; [defining certain terms relating to the taxation of the
sale of cannabis;] requiring a cannabis tax permit [to engage in the
sale] issued by the Department of Taxation to engage in or conduct
the business of selling cannabis [;] or cannabis products; providing
for the issuance, revocation and suspension of a cannabis tax permit;
requiring the suspension of a cannabis license under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the wholesale and retail sale of cannabis by certain
2 licensed cannabis establishments. (NRS 372A.290) Existing law also requires any person
3 engaged in the business of selling at retail tangible personal property, [which includes] ,
4 including, without limitation, adult-use cannabis retail stores and cannabis consumption
5 lounges, to register or file an application for a permit for each place of business from the
6 Department of Taxation [.] , which is referred to as a sales tax permit. (NRS 360.5971)
7 Sections 3-5 of this bill define certain terms relating to the taxation of the sale of
8 cannabis. Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires [,] that, in addition to any other permit required
9 by law, including, without limitation, a sales tax permit, every person who [holds a license
10 from the Cannabis Compliance Board who] desires to engage in the sale of cannabis [of any
11 kind to] or cannabis products must, before obtaining a license from the Cannabis
12 Compliance Board, apply for and obtain a cannabis tax permit issued by the Department for
13 each place of business; and (2) establishes requirements for the application. Section 15 of this
14 bill make this requirement applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, and section 14 of
15 this bill establishes the manner in which persons engaging in the business of selling
16 cannabis or cannabis products before that date are required to comply with the
17 requirement to obtain a cannabis tax permit before that date.
18 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department , not later than 15 days after receiving an
19 application, to grant and issue to an applicant a separate cannabis tax permit for each place of
20 business and provide the applicant with a full written explanation of the liability for the
21 collection and payment of any applicable taxes. Section 7 also provides that a cannabis tax

Senate Amendment No. 361 to Senate Bill No. 41 Page 4
22 permit is not assignable and is only valid for the transaction of business at the place of
23 business designated in the permit.
24 Section 8 of this bill [:] establishes procedures for the Department to revoke or
25 suspend a cannabis tax permit for failure to comply with certain requirements relating
26 to excise taxes imposed on the sale of cannabis and cannabis products. Specifically,
27 section 8: (1) requires the Department to provide to the holder of a cannabis tax permit
28 certain information concerning any alleged noncompliance, and an opportunity to cure
29 such noncompliance, before issuing a notice of a hearing for the revocation or
30 suspension of the cannabis tax permit; (2) authorizes the Department to, after notice and a
31 hearing, revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit [failure to comply with any applicable
32 provision of state law or regulation of the Department governing taxation; (2)] for such
33 noncompliance; (3) provides for an appeal to the Nevada Tax Commission; and [(3)] (4)
34 requires the Department to send a copy of a final decision to revoke or suspend a permit to the
35 [Cannabis Compliance] Board.
36 Section 9 of this bill requires an aggrieved person to pay the amount of the tax liability,
37 or to enter into an agreement to pay the liability, before the person may seek judicial review of
38 a final decision of the Commission.
39 Section 9.5 of this bill establishes provisions for a holder of a license issued by the
40 Board who has requested to transfer the license to request and receive from the
41 Department a certificate of the amount of any delinquent excise taxes, and the penalties
42 and interest relating thereto.
43 Sections 10-12 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) indicate the proper placement of
44 sections [2-9] 2-9.5 in the Nevada Revised Statutes; and (2) clarify that certain provisions of
45 existing law apply to sections [2-9.] 2-9.5.
46 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in business as a cannabis establishment,
47 which includes the sale of cannabis or cannabis products, unless the person holds a license
48 from the [Cannabis Compliance] Board. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678B.530) Section 13 of
49 this bill requires the Board, upon receipt of a copy of a final decision [provided pursuant to
50 section 8,] to revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit or a sales and use tax permit, to
51 suspend the corresponding cannabis license of the cannabis establishment until the excise tax
52 liability is paid in full.
