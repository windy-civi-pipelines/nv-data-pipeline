AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring a cannabis tax permit issued
by the Department of Taxation to engage in or conduct
the business of selling cannabis or cannabis products;
providing for the issuance, revocation and suspension of a
cannabis tax permit; requiring the suspension of a
cannabis license under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the wholesale and retail sale of cannabis
2 by certain licensed cannabis establishments. (NRS 372A.290) Existing law also
3 requires any person engaged in the business of selling at retail tangible personal
4 property, including, without limitation, adult-use cannabis retail stores and cannabis
5 consumption lounges, to register or file an application for a permit for each place of
6 business from the Department of Taxation, which is referred to as a sales tax
7 permit. (NRS 360.5971)
8 Sections 3-5 of this bill define certain terms relating to the taxation of the sale
9 of cannabis. Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires that, in addition to any other permit
10 required by law, including, without limitation, a sales tax permit, every person who
11 desires to engage in the sale of cannabis or cannabis products must, before
12 obtaining a license from the Cannabis Compliance Board, apply for and obtain a
13 cannabis tax permit issued by the Department for each place of business; and (2)
14 establishes requirements for the application. Section 15 of this bill make this
15 requirement applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, and section 14 of this bill
16 establishes the manner in which persons engaging in the business of selling
-
*SB41_R1*
– 2 –
17 cannabis or cannabis products before that date are required to comply with the
18 requirement to obtain a cannabis tax permit before that date.
19 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department, not later than 15 days after
20 receiving an application, to grant and issue to an applicant a separate cannabis tax
21 permit for each place of business and provide the applicant with a full written
22 explanation of the liability for the collection and payment of any applicable taxes.
23 Section 7 also provides that a cannabis tax permit is not assignable and is only
24 valid for the transaction of business at the place of business designated in the
25 permit.
26 Section 8 of this bill establishes procedures for the Department to revoke or
27 suspend a cannabis tax permit for failure to comply with certain requirements
28 relating to excise taxes imposed on the sale of cannabis and cannabis products.
29 Specifically, section 8: (1) requires the Department to provide to the holder of a
30 cannabis tax permit certain information concerning any alleged noncompliance, and
31 an opportunity to cure such noncompliance, before issuing a notice of a hearing for
32 the revocation or suspension of the cannabis tax permit; (2) authorizes the
33 Department to, after notice and a hearing, revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit
34 for such noncompliance; (3) provides for an appeal to the Nevada Tax
35 Commission; and (4) requires the Department to send a copy of a final decision to
36 revoke or suspend a permit to the Board.
37 Section 9 of this bill requires an aggrieved person to pay the amount of the tax
38 liability, or to enter into an agreement to pay the liability, before the person may
39 seek judicial review of a final decision of the Commission.
40 Section 9.5 of this bill establishes provisions for a holder of a license issued by
41 the Board who has requested to transfer the license to request and receive from the
42 Department a certificate of the amount of any delinquent excise taxes, and the
43 penalties and interest relating thereto.
44 Sections 10-12 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) indicate the proper
45 placement of sections 2-9.5 in the Nevada Revised Statutes; and (2) clarify that
46 certain provisions of existing law apply to sections 2-9.5.
47 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in business as a cannabis
48 establishment, which includes the sale of cannabis or cannabis products, unless the
49 person holds a license from the Board. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678B.530)
50 Section 13 of this bill requires the Board, upon receipt of a copy of a final decision
51 to revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit or a sales and use tax permit, to suspend
52 the corresponding cannabis license of the cannabis establishment until the excise
53 tax liability is paid in full.

FIRST REPRINT S.B. 41
SENATE BILL NO. 41–COMMITTEE ON
REVENUE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
(ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 18, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue and
Economic Development
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the taxation of
cannabis establishments. (BDR 32-284)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring a cannabis tax permit issued
by the Department of Taxation to engage in or conduct
the business of selling cannabis or cannabis products;
providing for the issuance, revocation and suspension of a
cannabis tax permit; requiring the suspension of a
cannabis license under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the wholesale and retail sale of cannabis
2 by certain licensed cannabis establishments. (NRS 372A.290) Existing law also
3 requires any person engaged in the business of selling at retail tangible personal
4 property, including, without limitation, adult-use cannabis retail stores and cannabis
5 consumption lounges, to register or file an application for a permit for each place of
6 business from the Department of Taxation, which is referred to as a sales tax
7 permit. (NRS 360.5971)
8 Sections 3-5 of this bill define certain terms relating to the taxation of the sale
9 of cannabis. Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires that, in addition to any other permit
10 required by law, including, without limitation, a sales tax permit, every person who
11 desires to engage in the sale of cannabis or cannabis products must, before
12 obtaining a license from the Cannabis Compliance Board, apply for and obtain a
13 cannabis tax permit issued by the Department for each place of business; and (2)
14 establishes requirements for the application. Section 15 of this bill make this
15 requirement applicable beginning on January 1, 2027, and section 14 of this bill
16 establishes the manner in which persons engaging in the business of selling

18 requirement to obtain a cannabis tax permit before that date.
19 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department, not later than 15 days after
20 receiving an application, to grant and issue to an applicant a separate cannabis tax
21 permit for each place of business and provide the applicant with a full written
22 explanation of the liability for the collection and payment of any applicable taxes.
23 Section 7 also provides that a cannabis tax permit is not assignable and is only
24 valid for the transaction of business at the place of business designated in the
25 permit.
26 Section 8 of this bill establishes procedures for the Department to revoke or
27 suspend a cannabis tax permit for failure to comply with certain requirements
28 relating to excise taxes imposed on the sale of cannabis and cannabis products.
29 Specifically, section 8: (1) requires the Department to provide to the holder of a
30 cannabis tax permit certain information concerning any alleged noncompliance, and
31 an opportunity to cure such noncompliance, before issuing a notice of a hearing for
32 the revocation or suspension of the cannabis tax permit; (2) authorizes the
33 Department to, after notice and a hearing, revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit
34 for such noncompliance; (3) provides for an appeal to the Nevada Tax
35 Commission; and (4) requires the Department to send a copy of a final decision to
36 revoke or suspend a permit to the Board.
37 Section 9 of this bill requires an aggrieved person to pay the amount of the tax
38 liability, or to enter into an agreement to pay the liability, before the person may
39 seek judicial review of a final decision of the Commission.
40 Section 9.5 of this bill establishes provisions for a holder of a license issued by
41 the Board who has requested to transfer the license to request and receive from the
42 Department a certificate of the amount of any delinquent excise taxes, and the
43 penalties and interest relating thereto.
44 Sections 10-12 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) indicate the proper
45 placement of sections 2-9.5 in the Nevada Revised Statutes; and (2) clarify that
46 certain provisions of existing law apply to sections 2-9.5.
47 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in business as a cannabis
48 establishment, which includes the sale of cannabis or cannabis products, unless the
49 person holds a license from the Board. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678B.530)
50 Section 13 of this bill requires the Board, upon receipt of a copy of a final decision
51 to revoke or suspend a cannabis tax permit or a sales and use tax permit, to suspend
52 the corresponding cannabis license of the cannabis establishment until the excise
53 tax liability is paid in full.
