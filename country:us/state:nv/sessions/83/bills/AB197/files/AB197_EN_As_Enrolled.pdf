Backus and Hafen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring, with
certain exceptions, a governmental entity to keep confidential
certain personal information regarding donors, members or
volunteers of a nonprofit organization; prohibiting, with
certain exceptions, a governmental entity from requesting or
releasing certain personal information regarding donors,
members or volunteers of a nonprofit organization; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes certain governmental agencies to collect certain
personal information. (Chapter 239B of NRS) Existing law also prohibits, with
certain exceptions, a governmental agency from requiring a person to include
certain personal information on any document submitted to the governmental
agency after a certain date. (NRS 239B.030) Section 2 of this bill requires, with
certain exceptions, a governmental entity to keep confidential any personal
information in the records of the governmental entity that identifies a person as a
donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit organization. Section 2 also prohibits,
with certain exceptions, a governmental entity from: (1) requiring that any person
or nonprofit organization provide the governmental entity with personal
information that identifies a person as a donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit
organization; (2) releasing, publicizing or otherwise publicly disclosing personal
information that identifies a person as a donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit
organization; or (3) requesting or requiring a current or prospective contractor or
grantee to provide a list of nonprofit organizations to which the contractor or
grantee has provided support or in-kind services or goods. Section 2 provides that
the personal information that identifies a person as a donor, member or volunteer of
a nonprofit organization includes any list, record, register, roster or other data of
any kind that includes a donation, name, address or telephone number that directly
or indirectly identifies a person as a donor of financial support or in-kind services
or goods, a member or a volunteer of any nonprofit organization.
Section 2 provides that a person who alleges that the person has been harmed
by a governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity that
has violated these provisions may bring a civil action to obtain certain relief. To
prevail, section 2 requires the person to prove that the governmental entity or
officer or employee thereof caused the person harm as a result of actions the entity,
officer or employee knew or should have known were a violation of these
provisions.
Section 1 of this bill provides that such personal information is not a public
record.
Section 3 of this bill prohibits the Secretary of State, when carrying out certain
requirements of existing law, from collecting or disclosing any information that
directly identifies a person as a donor of financial support to a nonprofit
organization.
Section 4 of this bill provides that any information collected by the Attorney
General in an audit, examination, review or investigation of a corporation for public
benefit or a corporation holding assets in charitable trust may only be used in
