AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring, with certain
exceptions, a governmental entity to keep confidential certain personal
information regarding donors, members or volunteers of a nonprofit
organization; prohibiting, with certain exceptions, a governmental
entity from requesting or releasing certain personal information
regarding donors, members or volunteers of a nonprofit organization;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain governmental agencies to collect certain personal
2 information. (Chapter 239B of NRS) Existing law also prohibits, with certain exceptions, a
3 governmental agency from requiring a person to include certain personal information on any
4 document submitted to the governmental agency after a certain date. (NRS 239B.030) Section
5 2 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a governmental entity to keep confidential any
6 personal information in the records of the governmental entity that identifies a person as a
7 donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit organization. Section 2 also prohibits, with certain
8 exceptions, a governmental entity from: (1) requiring that any person or nonprofit
9 organization provide the governmental entity with personal information that identifies a
10 person as a donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit organization; (2) releasing, publicizing
11 or otherwise publicly disclosing personal information that identifies a person as a donor,
12 member or volunteer of a nonprofit organization; or (3) requesting or requiring a current or
13 prospective contractor or grantee to provide a list of nonprofit organizations to which the
14 contractor or grantee has provided support [.] or in-kind services or goods. Section 2
15 provides that the personal information that identifies a person as a donor, member or volunteer
16 of a nonprofit organization includes any list, record, register, roster or other data of any kind
17 that includes a donation, name, address or telephone number that directly or indirectly
18 identifies a person as a donor of financial [or nonfinancial] support [,] or in-kind services or
19 goods, a member or a volunteer of any nonprofit organization.
20 Section 2 provides that a person who alleges that the person has been harmed by a
21 governmental entity or an officer or employee of a governmental entity that has violated these
22 provisions may bring a civil action to obtain certain relief. To prevail, section 2 requires the
23 person to prove that the governmental entity or officer or employee thereof caused the
24 person harm as a result of actions the entity, officer or employee knew or should have
25 known were a violation of these provisions.

Assembly Amendment No. 176 to Assembly Bill No. 197 Page 4
26 Section 1 of this bill provides that such personal information is not a public record.
27 Section 3 of this bill prohibits the Secretary of State, when carrying out certain
28 requirements of existing law, from collecting or disclosing any information that directly
29 identifies a person as a donor of financial support to a nonprofit organization.
30 Section 4 of this bill provides that any information collected by the Attorney General in
31 an audit, examination, review or investigation of a corporation for public benefit or a
32 corporation holding assets in charitable trust may only be used in connection with the audit,
33 examination, review or investigation and is otherwise subject to the requirements of section 2.

37 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
38 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
39 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
40 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
41 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
42 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,

48 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

Assembly Amendment No. 176 to Assembly Bill No. 197 Page 6

2 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
3 record that is not otherwise confidential.
4 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
5 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
6 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
7 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
8 (a) The public record:
9 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
10 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
11 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
12 electronic medium would:
13 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
14 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
15 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
16 otherwise confidential.
17 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
18 custody or control of a public record:
19 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
20 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
21 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
22 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
23 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
24 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
25 Sec. 2. Chapter 239B of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
26 section to read as follows:
27 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a governmental entity shall
28 maintain in a confidential manner any personal information that identifies a
29 person as a donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit organization.
30 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a governmental entity shall
31 not:
32 (a) Require any person or nonprofit organization to provide the
33 governmental entity with personal information that identifies a person as a
34 donor, member or volunteer of a nonprofit organization or otherwise compel the
35 release of such personal information;
36 (b) Release, publicize or otherwise publicly disclose personal information in
37 possession of the governmental entity that identifies a person as a donor, member
38 or volunteer of a nonprofit organization; or
