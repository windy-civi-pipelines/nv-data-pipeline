Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require the State to establish a Medicaid Advisory
2 Committee and a Beneficiary Advisory Council to advise the Director of the
3 Department of Health and Human Services concerning policy developments related
4 to and the effective administration of Medicaid. Existing federal regulations
5 prescribe requirements governing the membership of the Committee and Council,
6 including a requirement that a certain percentage of the voting members of the
7 Medicaid Advisory Committee concurrently serve on the Beneficiary Advisory
8 Council. (42 C.F.R. § 431.12)
9 To comply with these federal requirements, section 5 of this bill creates the
10 Beneficiary Advisory Council within the Division of Health Care Financing and
11 Policy of the Department to advise the Medicaid Advisory Committee on the
12 experience of persons who are recipients of Medicaid. Section 6 of this bill
-
*AB556*

– 2 –
13 prescribes the membership of the Council, which includes: (1) one member of the
14 executive leadership of the Division; and (2) at least four persons who currently are
15 or formerly were recipients of Medicaid or have direct experience supporting a
16 recipient of Medicaid. Section 7 of this bill requires the Council to meet at least
17 quarterly.
18 Existing state law creates the Medical Care Advisory Committee within the
19 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to advise the
20 Division on the provision of services relating to health and medical care to
21 recipients of welfare and participate in the development of policy and the
22 administration of programs of the Division. (NRS 422.151) Existing law: (1)
23 prescribes the membership of the Committee; (2) provides that the term of a
24 member of the Committee is 2 years; and (3) provides that members serve without
25 compensation, except for the per diem allowance and travel expenses provided for
26 state officers and employees. (NRS 422.153)
27 Sections 8-10 of this bill change the name of the Medical Care Advisory
28 Committee to the Medicaid Advisory Committee. Section 8 requires the Medicaid
29 Advisory Committee to advise the Division on the ability of persons to access
30 services provided by Medicaid. Section 9 adds certain voting members, including
31 requiring at least 25 percent of the members of the Committee to be persons who
32 also serve on the Council. Sections 6 and 9 additionally: (1) prohibit a member of
33 either the Council or Committee from serving two consecutive terms; and (2)
34 authorize members of either the Council or Committee who are recipients of
35 Medicaid to receive certain compensation while engaged in the business of the
36 Council or Committee. Section 10 increases the frequency with which the
37 Medicaid Advisory Committee meets from once to quarterly each calendar year.
38 Sections 12 and 13 of this bill require the Director of the Department of Health and
39 Human Services to appoint the members of the Council and Committee,
40 respectively, to staggered terms. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms
41 “Beneficiary Advisory Council” and “Medicaid Advisory Committee,”
42 respectively. Section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions.
43 Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to administer
44 sections 2-7 in the same manner as the provisions of law relating to Medicaid.
