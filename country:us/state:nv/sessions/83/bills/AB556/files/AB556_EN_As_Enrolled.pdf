CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; creating and prescribing the duties
of the Beneficiary Advisory Council of the Division of
Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of
Health and Human Services; prescribing requirements
governing the membership and procedures of the Council;
revising the name of the Medical Care Advisory Committee
of the Division to the Medicaid Advisory Committee; adding
certain members to the Committee; revising certain
requirements governing the operations of the Committee; and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations require the State to establish a Medicaid Advisory
Committee and a Beneficiary Advisory Council to advise the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services concerning policy developments related
to and the effective administration of Medicaid. Existing federal regulations
prescribe requirements governing the membership of the Committee and Council,
including a requirement that a certain percentage of the voting members of the
Medicaid Advisory Committee concurrently serve on the Beneficiary Advisory
Council. (42 C.F.R. § 431.12)
To comply with these federal requirements, section 5 of this bill creates the
Beneficiary Advisory Council within the Division of Health Care Financing and
Policy of the Department to advise the Medicaid Advisory Committee on the
experience of persons who are recipients of Medicaid. Section 6 of this bill
prescribes the membership of the Council, which includes: (1) one member of the
executive leadership of the Division; and (2) at least four persons who currently are
or formerly were recipients of Medicaid or have direct experience supporting a
recipient of Medicaid. Section 7 of this bill requires the Council to meet at least
quarterly.
Existing state law creates the Medical Care Advisory Committee within the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to advise the
Division on the provision of services relating to health and medical care to
recipients of welfare and participate in the development of policy and the
administration of programs of the Division. (NRS 422.151) Existing law: (1)
prescribes the membership of the Committee; (2) provides that the term of a
member of the Committee is 2 years; and (3) provides that members serve without
compensation, except for the per diem allowance and travel expenses provided for
state officers and employees. (NRS 422.153)
Sections 8-10 of this bill change the name of the Medical Care Advisory
Committee to the Medicaid Advisory Committee. Section 8 requires the Medicaid
Advisory Committee to advise the Division on the ability of persons to access
services provided by Medicaid. Section 9 adds certain voting members, including
requiring at least 25 percent of the members of the Committee to be persons who
also serve on the Council. Sections 6 and 9 additionally: (1) prohibit a member of
either the Council or Committee from serving two consecutive terms; and (2)
authorize members of either the Council or Committee who are recipients of
Medicaid to receive certain compensation while engaged in the business of the
Council or Committee. Section 10 increases the frequency with which the
-

– 2 –
Medicaid Advisory Committee meets from once to quarterly each calendar year.
Sections 12 and 13 of this bill require the Director of the Department of Health and
Human Services to appoint the members of the Council and Committee,
respectively, to staggered terms. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms
“Beneficiary Advisory Council” and “Medicaid Advisory Committee,”
respectively. Section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions.
Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to administer
sections 2-7 in the same manner as the provisions of law relating to Medicaid.
