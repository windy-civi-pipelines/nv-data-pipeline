ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Condemning the attack on
the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, including the assault
on law enforcement officers, and denouncing the use of
presidential pardons and commutations to absolve the
participants in the riot.
1 WHEREAS, On January 6, 2021, a mob violently overpowered
2 the U.S. Capitol Police and breached the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the
3 peaceful transfer of power; and

7 American Republic; and

1 WHEREAS, The U.S. Capitol Police, alongside other law
2 enforcement agencies, demonstrated heroism and unwavering
3 courage, professionalism and commitment to their duties while
4 protecting members of Congress and others within the U.S. Capitol
5 during the attack, which resulted in traumatic injuries to at least 140
6 law enforcement officers in the line of duty; and
7 WHEREAS, President Donald Trump’s granting of pardons and
8 commutations on January 20, 2025, to the roughly 1,500 criminals
9 involved in the attack is an act of betrayal not only to the law
10 enforcement officers who risked their lives on January 6, 2021, but
11 to all U.S. citizens; and
12 WHEREAS, Among those criminals was one who assaulted D.C.
13 Metropolitan Police Department Officer Noah Rathbun with a
14 flagpole, another who repeatedly pressed a stun gun into the neck of
15 D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Officer Michael Fanone and
16 another who sprayed multiple law enforcement officers with bear
17 spray; and
18 WHEREAS, The International Association of Chiefs of Police
19 and the Fraternal Order of Police jointly condemned these
20 presidential pardons and commutations, emphasizing that crimes
21 against law enforcement officers are attacks on society and
22 undermine the rule of law and that failure to hold perpetrators of
23 violent crimes against law enforcement officers accountable may
24 embolden others to commit similar acts of violence; now, therefore,
25 be it
26 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF
27 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd session of the
28 Nevada Legislature condemn the attack on the U.S. Capitol on
29 January 6, 2021, including the assault on law enforcement officers,
30 and denounce the use of presidential pardons and commutations to
31 absolve the participants in the riot; and be it further
32 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and
33 transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United
34 States, the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, the
35 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and the
36 members of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
37 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
38 passage.
