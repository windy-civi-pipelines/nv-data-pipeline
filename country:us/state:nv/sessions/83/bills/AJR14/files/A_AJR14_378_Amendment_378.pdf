ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Condemning the attack on the U.S. Capitol
on January 6, 2021, including the assault on law enforcement officers,
and denouncing the use of presidential pardons and commutations to
absolve the participants in the riot.
1 WHEREAS, On January 6, 2021, a mob violently overpowered the U.S. Capitol
2 Police and breached the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the peaceful transfer of power; and
3 WHEREAS, This insurrection was not only an attack on the U.S. Capitol, but on
4 the rule of law, the values of American democracy and the U.S. Constitution, which
5 are the very foundations of the American Republic; and
6 WHEREAS, The U.S. Capitol Police, alongside other law enforcement agencies,
7 demonstrated heroism and unwavering courage, professionalism and commitment
8 to their duties while protecting members of Congress and others within the U.S.
9 Capitol during the attack, which resulted in traumatic injuries to at least 140 law
10 enforcement officers in the line of duty; and
11 WHEREAS, President Donald Trump’s granting of pardons and commutations
12 on January 20, 2025, to the roughly 1,500 criminals involved in the attack is an act
13 of betrayal not only to the law enforcement officers who risked their lives on
14 January 6, 2021, but to all U.S. citizens; and
15 WHEREAS, Among those criminals was one who assaulted D.C. Metropolitan
16 Police Department Officer Noah Rathbun with a flagpole, another who repeatedly
17 pressed a stun gun into the neck of D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Officer

Assembly Amendment No. 378 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 14 Page 4
1 Michael Fanone and another who sprayed multiple law enforcement officers with
2 bear spray; and
3 WHEREAS, The International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal
4 Order of Police jointly condemned these presidential pardons and commutations,
5 emphasizing that crimes against law enforcement officers are attacks on society and
6 undermine the rule of law and that failure to hold perpetrators of violent crimes
7 against law enforcement officers accountable may embolden others to commit
8 similar acts of violence; now, therefore, be it
9 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
10 That the members of the 83rd session of the Nevada Legislature condemn the attack
11 on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, including the assault on law enforcement
12 officers, and denounce the use of presidential pardons and commutations to absolve
13 the participants in the riot; and be it further
14 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy
15 of this resolution to the President of the United States, the President Pro Tempore
16 of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
17 Representatives and the members of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be
18 it further
19 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage.
