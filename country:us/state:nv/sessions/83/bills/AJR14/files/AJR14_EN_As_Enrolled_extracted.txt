ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Condemning the attack on
the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, including the assault on
law enforcement officers, and denouncing the use of
presidential pardons and commutations to absolve the
participants in the riot.
WHEREAS, On January 6, 2021, a mob violently overpowered
the U.S. Capitol Police and breached the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the
peaceful transfer of power; and
WHEREAS, This insurrection was not only an attack on the U.S.
Capitol, but on the rule of law, the values of American democracy
and the U.S. Constitution, which are the very foundations of the
American Republic; and
WHEREAS, The U.S. Capitol Police, alongside other law
enforcement agencies, demonstrated heroism and unwavering
courage, professionalism and commitment to their duties while
protecting members of Congress and others within the U.S. Capitol
during the attack, which resulted in traumatic injuries to at least 140
law enforcement officers in the line of duty; and
WHEREAS, President Donald Trump’s granting of pardons and
commutations on January 20, 2025, to the roughly 1,500 criminals
involved in the attack is an act of betrayal not only to the law
enforcement officers who risked their lives on January 6, 2021, but
to all U.S. citizens; and
WHEREAS, Among those criminals was one who assaulted D.C.
Metropolitan Police Department Officer Noah Rathbun with a
flagpole, another who repeatedly pressed a stun gun into the neck of
D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Officer Michael Fanone and
another who sprayed multiple law enforcement officers with bear
spray; and
WHEREAS, The International Association of Chiefs of Police
and the Fraternal Order of Police jointly condemned these
presidential pardons and commutations, emphasizing that crimes

against law enforcement officers are attacks on society and
undermine the rule of law and that failure to hold perpetrators of
violent crimes against law enforcement officers accountable may
embolden others to commit similar acts of violence; now, therefore,
be it
RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF
NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd session of the
Nevada Legislature condemn the attack on the U.S. Capitol on
January 6, 2021, including the assault on law enforcement officers,
and denounce the use of presidential pardons and commutations to
absolve the participants in the riot; and be it further
RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and
transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United
States, the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate, the
Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and the
members of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
