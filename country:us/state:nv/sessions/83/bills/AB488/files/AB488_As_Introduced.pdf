AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions relating
to vacating a judgment of conviction and sealing certain
records of certain victims; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain victims convicted of certain offenses to petition
2 the court to vacate a judgment of conviction against the victim and seal all
3 documents relating to the case. Under existing law, such offenses include: (1) any
4 crime under the laws of this State, other than a crime of violence; or (2) a violation
5 of a county, city or town ordinance for loitering for the purposes of solicitation or
6 prostitution. (NRS 179.247) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of offenses under
7 which a victim of human trafficking may petition the court to vacate a judgment of
8 conviction and seal all documents relating to the case to include any crime under
9 the laws of this State and any violation of a county, city or town ordinance. Section
10 1 also revises the applicable criminal procedure, including, without limitation, by
11 requiring the court to appoint counsel for an indigent petitioner. Finally, section 1
12 requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to report to each regular session of
13 the Legislature certain information relating to such petitions. Section 3 of this bill
14 provides that the changes in section 1 apply retroactively to any conviction
15 obtained before, on or after the effective date of this bill.

11 subsection 1 [if the person was convicted of:
12 (a) A violation of NRS 201.353 or 201.354, for engaging in
13 prostitution or solicitation for prostitution, provided that the person
14 was not alleged to be a customer of a prostitute;
15 (b) A crime under the laws of this State, other than a crime of

21 prosecuting agency.
22 3. A petition filed pursuant to subsection 1 must satisfy the

25 petitioner is a victim of human trafficking; and
26 (b) Facts which support the petitioner’s grounds for relief.
27 4. [The court may grant a petition filed pursuant to subsection
28 1 if:
29 (a) The petitioner was convicted of a violation of an offense
30 described in subsection 2;
31 (b) The participation of the petitioner in the offense was the
32 result of the petitioner having been a victim of:
33 (1) Trafficking in persons as described in the Trafficking
34 Victims Protection Act of 2000, 22 U.S.C. §§ 7101 et seq.; or

2 attorney who prosecuted the petitioner for the crime and any person
3 to testify and present evidence on behalf of any such entity; and
4 (b) Take into consideration any reasonable concerns for the
5 safety of the defendant, family members of the defendant or other
6 victims that may be jeopardized by the granting of the petition.
7 6. If the prosecuting agency that prosecuted the petitioner for

9 sealing all documents, papers and exhibits related to the case, the
10 court shall apply the presumption set forth in NRS 179.2445, vacate
11 the judgment and seal all documents, papers and exhibits related to
12 the case. If the prosecuting agency does not stipulate to vacating the

16 court makes the findings set forth in subsection 4, the court may
17 vacate the judgment and seal all documents, papers and exhibits in
18 accordance with subsection 7 without a hearing.] Official

21 there is a rebuttable presumption that the petitioner is a victim of
22 human trafficking.
23 5. Upon the receipt of a petition filed pursuant to subsection
24 1, the court shall determine whether the petition sets forth a prima
25 facie case for granting the relief requested. If the court [does not
26 order the sealing of the records or the prosecuting agency files a
27 written objection,] determines that the petitioner has demonstrated
28 with prima facie evidence that grounds exist for granting the relief
29 requested, a hearing on the petition must be conducted. If the court
30 grants a hearing, the court shall appoint counsel for the petitioner
31 in accordance with NRS 34.750. At the hearing [, unless an
32 objecting party presents evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption
33 set forth in NRS 179.2445, the court shall vacate the judgment,
34 apply the presumption and seal all documents, papers and exhibits
35 related to the case.
36 7.] , the petitioner has the burden of proving by a
37 preponderance of the evidence that:
38 (a) At the time the offense for which the relief is requested was

41 direct result of the petitioner having been a victim of human
42 trafficking.
43 6. If the court [grants a petition filed pursuant to subsection 1,]
44 determines based on the evidence presented at the hearing that the
-

2 shall:
3 (a) Vacate the judgment and dismiss the accusatory pleading;
4 and
5 (b) Order sealed all documents, papers and exhibits in the
6 petitioner’s record, minute book entries and entries on dockets, and
7 other documents relating to the case in the custody of such other

9 [8.] 7. If a petition filed pursuant to subsection 1 does not
10 satisfy the requirements [of NRS 179.245] prescribed by subsection
11 3 or the court determines that the petition is otherwise deficient with
12 respect to the sealing of the petitioner’s record, the court may enter
13 an order to vacate the judgment and dismiss the accusatory pleading
14 if the petitioner satisfies all requirements necessary for the judgment
15 to be vacated.
16 [9.] 8. If the court enters an order pursuant to subsection [8,] 7,
17 the court shall also order sealed the records of the petitioner which
18 relate to the judgment being vacated in accordance with paragraph
19 (b) of subsection [7,] 6, regardless of whether any records relating to
20 other convictions are ineligible for sealing either by operation of law
