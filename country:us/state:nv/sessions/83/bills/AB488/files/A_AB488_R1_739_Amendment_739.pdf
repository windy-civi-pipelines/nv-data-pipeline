7 court to vacate a judgment of conviction and seal all documents relating to the case to include
8 any crime under the laws of this State and any violation of a county, city or town ordinance;
9 and (2) revises the applicable criminal procedure. Section 3 of this bill provides that the
10 changes in section 1 apply: (1) retroactively to any conviction obtained before the effective
11 date of this bill; (2) to any conviction obtained on or after the effective date of this bill; and
12 (3) to a petition filed on or after the effective date of this bill.
