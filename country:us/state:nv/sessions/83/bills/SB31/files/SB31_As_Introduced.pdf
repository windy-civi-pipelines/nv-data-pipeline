EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; providing that a federal agency that is a
claimant of a vested water right is not required to file
proof of the claim on or before a certain date; revising
requirements relating to a notice of pending adjudication
of certain water rights; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing federal law, the Federal Government has waived its sovereign
2 immunity and consented to be joined as a defendant in any suit for the general
3 adjudication of water rights in a stream system. (43 U.S.C. § 666) Under existing
4 state law, a claimant of a vested water right must submit proof of the claim to the
5 State Engineer on or before December 31, 2027. If a claimant fails to submit such
6 proof, the claim is deemed to be abandoned. (NRS 533.087) Upon entering an order
7 to adjudicate the vested water rights of a stream system, existing state law requires
8 the State Engineer to provide notice of the pending adjudication to all claimants. As
9 all claimants other than federal agencies, which are not subject to state law but have
10 consented under federal law to a general adjudication of water rights in a stream
11 system, are required to submit proof of such claims on or before December 31,
12 2027, existing state law requires that, beginning on January 1, 2028, such a notice
13 of pending adjudication must state that federal agencies are required to make proof
14 of claims of a reserved water right. (NRS 533.095) Section 1 of this bill clarifies
15 that a claimant that is a federal agency is not required to submit proof of a claim by
16 December 31, 2027. Section 2 of this bill revises the information that must be
17 included in a notice of pending adjudication beginning on January 1, 2028, to also
