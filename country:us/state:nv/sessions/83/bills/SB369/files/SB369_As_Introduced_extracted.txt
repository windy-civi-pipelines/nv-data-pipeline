AN ACT relating to financial institutions; requiring certain financial
institutions, credit unions, savings banks and thrift
companies to take certain actions relating to the use of an
emergency financial contact for certain accounts and
transactions which involve an older person or vulnerable
person; authorizing certain persons to temporarily delay
certain financial transactions involving the suspected
exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person;

vulnerable person; and providing other matters properly

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain financial institutions, credit unions, savings banks
2 and thrift companies to: (1) provide training concerning the identification and
3 reporting of the exploitation of older persons and vulnerable persons to certain
4 directors, officers and employees who may interact with or review information of
5 an older person or vulnerable person in providing financial services; and (2)
6 designate a person to whom a director, officer or employee must report known or
7 suspected exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person. (NRS 657.220-
8 657.290, 672.767-672.779, 673.773-673.807, 677.673-677.707) Existing law
9 requires a designated reporter, under certain circumstances, to report known or
-

– 2 –
10 suspected exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person to the Aging and
11 Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services, a
12 police department or sheriff’s office and any county office for protective services.
13 (NRS 657.290, 672.779, 673.807, 677.707)
14 Existing law also: (1) authorizes a designated reporter for certain financial
15 institutions to delay a requested disbursement or transaction involving an older
16 person or vulnerable person if the designated reporter knows or has reasonable
17 cause to believe that the older person or vulnerable person has been exploited; and
18 (2) sets forth procedures and requirements for the imposition of such a delay.
19 Additionally, existing law provides that a financial institution and its officers,
20 employees and designated reporters are immune from criminal, civil and
21 administrative liability for: (1) making a report concerning the known or suspected
22 exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person in good faith; (2) delaying a
23 requested disbursement or transaction involving such exploitation; and (3) taking
24 certain other actions relating to such exploitation. (NRS 657.290) Sections 20, 30
25 and 40 of this bill make those provisions similarly applicable to credit unions,
26 savings banks and thrift companies.
27 Sections 2, 12, 22 and 32 of this bill define “covered account” to mean an
28 account for which a financial institution, credit union, savings bank or thrift
29 company has actual knowledge is an account of an older person or vulnerable
30 person or to which an older person or vulnerable person is a beneficiary. Sections
31 5, 15, 25 and 35 of this bill require a financial institution, credit union, savings
32 bank and thrift company, before opening any covered account, to require the
33 prospective account holder to either complete a form designating a person to serve
34 as an emergency financial contact or complete a form declining to designate an
35 emergency financial contact. Sections 6, 16, 26 and 36 of this bill authorize the
36 account holder of a covered account that was opened in a financial institution,
37 credit union, savings bank or thrift company before October 1, 2025, to, upon
38 request of the account holder, designate an emergency financial contact. Sections 6,
39 16, 26 and 36 authorize a financial institution, credit union, savings bank or thrift
40 company to notify and provide information to account holders of covered accounts
41 that were opened before October 1, 2025, concerning the designation of an
42 emergency financial contact.
43 Sections 3, 13, 23 and 33 of this bill define “covered transaction” to mean a
44 requested disbursement from or a requested transaction involving a covered
45 account that exceeds $5,000. Sections 7, 17, 27 and 37 of this bill require a
46 financial institution, credit union, savings bank and thrift company to attempt to
47 contact a designated emergency financial contact within 24 hours after a covered
48 transaction is requested involving a covered account for which the account holder
49 has designated an emergency financial contact. Sections 7, 17, 27 and 37 prohibit
50 the entity from proceeding with the covered transaction until 24 hours after
51 attempting such contact or, if applicable, the expiration of any temporary delay,
52 whichever is later. Under sections 7, 17, 27 and 37, if a director, officer or
53 employee of such an entity, after attempting such contact, knows or suspects that
54 exploitation has occurred or is occurring, the director, officer or employee is
55 required to report the known or suspected exploitation to the designated reporter.
56 The designated reporter is required to proceed in accordance with the procedures
57 for handling other reports of known or suspected exploitation, except that, under
58 sections 10, 20, 30 and 40, the designated reporter is required, rather than
59 authorized, to temporarily delay the covered transaction.
60 Sections 10, 20, 30 and 40 provide immunity from criminal, civil and
61 administrative liability to a financial institution, credit union, savings bank and
62 thrift company for taking the actions required by sections 7, 17, 27 and 37.
63 However, if such an entity violates the provisions of sections 7, 17, 27 and 37, and
64 the violation results in the exploitation of an account holder, sections 8, 18, 28 and
-
*SB369*
– 3 –
65 38 of this bill authorize the account holder to bring an action against the entity, in
66 which the account holder is entitled to treble damages.
67 Sections 4, 14, 24 and 34 of this bill define “emergency financial contact.”
68 Sections 9, 19, 29 and 39 of this bill make a conforming change to apply the
69 definitions set forth in sections 2-4, 12-14, 22-24 and 32-34 to the provisions of
70 existing law requiring the identification and reporting of exploitation of older
71 persons and vulnerable persons by financial entities.
72 Existing law provides that a designated reporter for certain financial institutions
73 who delays a requested disbursement or transaction due to, or certain other persons
74 who make a report concerning, exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person
75 are not required to accept an acknowledged power of attorney under certain
76 circumstances. (NRS 162A.370) Section 41 of this bill makes those provisions
77 similarly applicable to designated reporters and certain persons who make such
78 reports for credit unions, savings banks and thrift companies.

SENATE BILL NO. 369–SENATORS STONE,
BUCK, HANSEN AND ELLISON
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to financial institutions.
(BDR 55-225)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to financial institutions; requiring certain financial
institutions, credit unions, savings banks and thrift
companies to take certain actions relating to the use of an
emergency financial contact for certain accounts and
transactions which involve an older person or vulnerable
person; authorizing certain persons to temporarily delay
certain financial transactions involving the suspected
exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person;
exempting certain persons from liability for certain
actions relating to the suspected exploitation of an older
person or vulnerable person; creating a civil cause of
action to recover damages for certain violations of certain
requirements relating to the use of an emergency financial
contact which result in exploitation of an older person or
vulnerable person; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain financial institutions, credit unions, savings banks
2 and thrift companies to: (1) provide training concerning the identification and
3 reporting of the exploitation of older persons and vulnerable persons to certain
4 directors, officers and employees who may interact with or review information of
5 an older person or vulnerable person in providing financial services; and (2)
6 designate a person to whom a director, officer or employee must report known or
7 suspected exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person. (NRS 657.220-
8 657.290, 672.767-672.779, 673.773-673.807, 677.673-677.707) Existing law
9 requires a designated reporter, under certain circumstances, to report known or
-
*SB369*

– 2 –
10 suspected exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person to the Aging and
11 Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human Services, a
12 police department or sheriff’s office and any county office for protective services.
13 (NRS 657.290, 672.779, 673.807, 677.707)
14 Existing law also: (1) authorizes a designated reporter for certain financial
15 institutions to delay a requested disbursement or transaction involving an older
16 person or vulnerable person if the designated reporter knows or has reasonable
17 cause to believe that the older person or vulnerable person has been exploited; and
18 (2) sets forth procedures and requirements for the imposition of such a delay.
19 Additionally, existing law provides that a financial institution and its officers,
20 employees and designated reporters are immune from criminal, civil and
21 administrative liability for: (1) making a report concerning the known or suspected
22 exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person in good faith; (2) delaying a
23 requested disbursement or transaction involving such exploitation; and (3) taking
24 certain other actions relating to such exploitation. (NRS 657.290) Sections 20, 30
25 and 40 of this bill make those provisions similarly applicable to credit unions,
26 savings banks and thrift companies.
27 Sections 2, 12, 22 and 32 of this bill define “covered account” to mean an
28 account for which a financial institution, credit union, savings bank or thrift
29 company has actual knowledge is an account of an older person or vulnerable
30 person or to which an older person or vulnerable person is a beneficiary. Sections
31 5, 15, 25 and 35 of this bill require a financial institution, credit union, savings
32 bank and thrift company, before opening any covered account, to require the
33 prospective account holder to either complete a form designating a person to serve
34 as an emergency financial contact or complete a form declining to designate an
35 emergency financial contact. Sections 6, 16, 26 and 36 of this bill authorize the
36 account holder of a covered account that was opened in a financial institution,
37 credit union, savings bank or thrift company before October 1, 2025, to, upon
38 request of the account holder, designate an emergency financial contact. Sections 6,
39 16, 26 and 36 authorize a financial institution, credit union, savings bank or thrift
40 company to notify and provide information to account holders of covered accounts
41 that were opened before October 1, 2025, concerning the designation of an
42 emergency financial contact.
43 Sections 3, 13, 23 and 33 of this bill define “covered transaction” to mean a
44 requested disbursement from or a requested transaction involving a covered
45 account that exceeds $5,000. Sections 7, 17, 27 and 37 of this bill require a
46 financial institution, credit union, savings bank and thrift company to attempt to
47 contact a designated emergency financial contact within 24 hours after a covered
48 transaction is requested involving a covered account for which the account holder
49 has designated an emergency financial contact. Sections 7, 17, 27 and 37 prohibit
50 the entity from proceeding with the covered transaction until 24 hours after
51 attempting such contact or, if applicable, the expiration of any temporary delay,
52 whichever is later. Under sections 7, 17, 27 and 37, if a director, officer or
53 employee of such an entity, after attempting such contact, knows or suspects that
54 exploitation has occurred or is occurring, the director, officer or employee is
55 required to report the known or suspected exploitation to the designated reporter.
56 The designated reporter is required to proceed in accordance with the procedures
57 for handling other reports of known or suspected exploitation, except that, under
58 sections 10, 20, 30 and 40, the designated reporter is required, rather than
59 authorized, to temporarily delay the covered transaction.
60 Sections 10, 20, 30 and 40 provide immunity from criminal, civil and
61 administrative liability to a financial institution, credit union, savings bank and
62 thrift company for taking the actions required by sections 7, 17, 27 and 37.
63 However, if such an entity violates the provisions of sections 7, 17, 27 and 37, and
64 the violation results in the exploitation of an account holder, sections 8, 18, 28 and
-
*SB369*

– 3 –
65 38 of this bill authorize the account holder to bring an action against the entity, in
66 which the account holder is entitled to treble damages.
67 Sections 4, 14, 24 and 34 of this bill define “emergency financial contact.”
68 Sections 9, 19, 29 and 39 of this bill make a conforming change to apply the
69 definitions set forth in sections 2-4, 12-14, 22-24 and 32-34 to the provisions of
70 existing law requiring the identification and reporting of exploitation of older
71 persons and vulnerable persons by financial entities.
72 Existing law provides that a designated reporter for certain financial institutions
73 who delays a requested disbursement or transaction due to, or certain other persons
74 who make a report concerning, exploitation of an older person or vulnerable person
75 are not required to accept an acknowledged power of attorney under certain
76 circumstances. (NRS 162A.370) Section 41 of this bill makes those provisions
77 similarly applicable to designated reporters and certain persons who make such
78 reports for credit unions, savings banks and thrift companies.
