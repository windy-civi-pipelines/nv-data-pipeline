Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education and
2 requires the Commission to develop a statewide vision and implementation plan to improve
3 the public education system in this State. (NRS 385.910, 385.920) Section 1 of this bill
4 creates the Subcommittee on Metrics of the Commission and requires the Subcommittee to
5 develop, in collaboration with the Department of Education, metrics for local educational
6 agencies and schools to measure the progress and success of pupils, schools and school
7 districts. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definition of the term
8 “Commission,” which is applicable to provisions governing the Commission on Innovation
9 and Excellence in Education, to the provisions of section 1. Section 2.5 of this bill revises the
10 membership of the Commission by adding: (1) the deans of the College of Education and
11 Human Development at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the College of Education at
12 the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and (2) the dean of the School of Education at Nevada
13 State University. Section 24 of this bill makes an appropriation of $68,910 for Fiscal Year
14 2025-2026 and $68,910 for Fiscal Year 2026-2027 for a staff position to oversee the
15 implementation of recommendations made by the Commission. Section 26 of this bill makes
16 an appropriation of $25,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $25,000 for the Fiscal Year
17 2026-2027 for the travel expenses of the members of the Commission and Subcommittee.
18 Existing law requires the Department to establish a pilot program to provide competency-
19 based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines “competency-based education” as a
Senate Amendment No. 874 to Senate Bill No. 403 First Reprint Page 4
20 system of instruction by which a pupil advances to a higher level of learning when the pupil
21 demonstrates mastery of a concept or skill, regardless of the time, place or pace at which the
22 pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200) Section 6 of this bill changes the term “competency-based
23 education” to “personalized, competency-based learning,” and revises the definition for that
24 term. Section 4.3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
25 body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, a committee to form
26 a charter school or a charter management organization to apply to the Department to provide a
27 program of personalized, competency-based learning and prescribes requirements for the
28 application process. Section 4.4 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school district or
29 the governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils to
30 ensure that the program is run in a manner that complies with any applicable statutes,
31 regulations or rules or policies of the school district, charter school or university school.
32 Section 4.5 of this bill authorizes a program of personalized, competency-based learning to be
33 provided on an alternative schedule. Section 4.6 of this bill requires the State Board of
34 Education to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5.
35 Section 4.2 of this bill requires the Department, not later than July 1, 2040, and at least
36 once every 5 years thereafter, to review and, as necessary, revise its Portrait of a Nevada
37 Learner to align with the educational needs of this State.
38 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts to schedule and provide a
39 minimum of 180 days of free school in the districts under their charge. (NRS 388.090)
40 Existing law authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to authorize a school district
41 to provide a program of instruction based on an alternative schedule, including a schedule
42 which involves the reduction of not more than 15 school days to provide a 12-month school
43 program. (NRS 388.090) Section 3 of this bill eliminates provisions authorizing the reduction
44 of up to 15 school days to provide for a 12-month school program and instead generally
45 authorizes an alternative schedule for a school to involve a reduction in the number of school
46 days.
47 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to establish a course of study in
48 occupational guidance and counseling and requires such instruction to be made available for
49 pupils in grades 7-12. Existing law requires the board of trustees in each school district to
50 organize and offer the curriculum within the limits of money made available for that purpose.
51 (NRS 389.041) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a local educational agency to develop,
52 maintain and publish on its Internet website recommendations for educational materials and
53 information regarding career exploration suitable for pupils in grades 1-5.
54 Existing law creates the Board of Economic Development, which, among other duties, is
55 required to make recommendations to the Executive Director of the Office of Economic
56 Development relating to the criteria to be used by the Office in providing development
57 resources and making allocations, grants and loans. (NRS 231.033, 231.037) Existing law
58 additionally requires the Board to review and evaluate all programs of economic development
59 in this State and make recommendations to the Legislature for legislation. (NRS 231.037)
60 Section 9 of this bill further requires such recommendations to include recommendations to
61 provide incentives for businesses, including small businesses, to provide opportunities for
62 career exploration to pupils enrolled in public high schools in this State. Section 9
63 additionally requires the Board to review and make recommendations to the Department
64 regarding technologies to facilitate the exploration by pupils of careers in industries in this
65 State.
66 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve transferable tax credits and abatements or
67 partial abatements of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain
68 businesses in certain circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application
69 for such credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria. (NRS 231.1555,
70 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections
71 10-23 of this bill authorize the Office to require an applicant for transferable tax credits or a
72 tax abatement to enter into an agreement with the Office that includes a plan by the applicant
73 to provide work-based learning opportunities to pupils enrolled in public high schools in this
74 State. Section 8.5 of this bill requires the Department to adopt a definition of “work-based
75 learning opportunity” for the purpose of such agreements.
76 Section 25 of this bill appropriates $2,250,000 to the Department to enter into a contract
77 with a qualified entity to provide professional development regarding personalized,
78 competency-based learning programs and assist the Commission on Innovation and
Senate Amendment No. 874 to Senate Bill No. 403 First Reprint Page 5
79 Excellence in Education in developing recommendations and the Department in implementing
80 such recommendations. Section 25.5 of this bill appropriates to the Department an
81 additional $222,763 for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $279,956 for Fiscal Year 2026-2027
82 for personnel and operating costs to carry out the provisions of this bill.

AN ACT relating to education; creating the Subcommittee on Metrics of the
Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education; revising
provisions governing competency-based learning; authorizing an
alternative schedule for public schools; authorizing local educational
agencies to develop, maintain and publish certain materials related to
career exploration; requiring the Board of Economic Development to

Development to require applicants for certain transferable tax credits
and certain tax abatements to agree to a plan to provide work-based
learning opportunities to pupils or instructors for career and technical
education courses; making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education and
2 requires the Commission to develop a statewide vision and implementation plan to improve
3 the public education system in this State. (NRS 385.910, 385.920) Section 1 of this bill
4 creates the Subcommittee on Metrics of the Commission and requires the Subcommittee to
5 develop, in collaboration with the Department of Education, metrics for local educational
6 agencies and schools to measure the progress and success of pupils, schools and school
7 districts. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definition of the term
8 “Commission,” which is applicable to provisions governing the Commission on Innovation
9 and Excellence in Education, to the provisions of section 1. Section 2.5 of this bill revises the
10 membership of the Commission by adding: (1) the deans of the College of Education and
11 Human Development at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the College of Education at
12 the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and (2) the dean of the School of Education at Nevada
13 State University. Section 24 of this bill makes an appropriation of $68,910 for Fiscal Year
14 2025-2026 and $68,910 for Fiscal Year 2026-2027 for a staff position to oversee the
15 implementation of recommendations made by the Commission. Section 26 of this bill makes
16 an appropriation of $25,000 for the Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $25,000 for the Fiscal Year
17 2026-2027 for the travel expenses of the members of the Commission and Subcommittee.
18 Existing law requires the Department to establish a pilot program to provide competency-
19 based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines “competency-based education” as a

Senate Amendment No. 874 to Senate Bill No. 403 First Reprint Page 4
20 system of instruction by which a pupil advances to a higher level of learning when the pupil
21 demonstrates mastery of a concept or skill, regardless of the time, place or pace at which the
22 pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200) Section 6 of this bill changes the term “competency-based
23 education” to “personalized, competency-based learning,” and revises the definition for that
24 term. Section 4.3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
25 body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, a committee to form
26 a charter school or a charter management organization to apply to the Department to provide a
27 program of personalized, competency-based learning and prescribes requirements for the
28 application process. Section 4.4 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school district or
29 the governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils to
30 ensure that the program is run in a manner that complies with any applicable statutes,
31 regulations or rules or policies of the school district, charter school or university school.
32 Section 4.5 of this bill authorizes a program of personalized, competency-based learning to be
33 provided on an alternative schedule. Section 4.6 of this bill requires the State Board of
34 Education to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5.
35 Section 4.2 of this bill requires the Department, not later than July 1, 2040, and at least
36 once every 5 years thereafter, to review and, as necessary, revise its Portrait of a Nevada
37 Learner to align with the educational needs of this State.
38 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts to schedule and provide a
39 minimum of 180 days of free school in the districts under their charge. (NRS 388.090)
40 Existing law authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to authorize a school district
41 to provide a program of instruction based on an alternative schedule, including a schedule
42 which involves the reduction of not more than 15 school days to provide a 12-month school
43 program. (NRS 388.090) Section 3 of this bill eliminates provisions authorizing the reduction
44 of up to 15 school days to provide for a 12-month school program and instead generally
45 authorizes an alternative schedule for a school to involve a reduction in the number of school
46 days.
47 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to establish a course of study in
48 occupational guidance and counseling and requires such instruction to be made available for
49 pupils in grades 7-12. Existing law requires the board of trustees in each school district to
50 organize and offer the curriculum within the limits of money made available for that purpose.
51 (NRS 389.041) Section 5 of this bill authorizes a local educational agency to develop,
52 maintain and publish on its Internet website recommendations for educational materials and
53 information regarding career exploration suitable for pupils in grades 1-5.
54 Existing law creates the Board of Economic Development, which, among other duties, is
55 required to make recommendations to the Executive Director of the Office of Economic
56 Development relating to the criteria to be used by the Office in providing development
57 resources and making allocations, grants and loans. (NRS 231.033, 231.037) Existing law
58 additionally requires the Board to review and evaluate all programs of economic development
59 in this State and make recommendations to the Legislature for legislation. (NRS 231.037)
60 Section 9 of this bill further requires such recommendations to include recommendations to
61 provide incentives for businesses, including small businesses, to provide opportunities for
62 career exploration to pupils enrolled in public high schools in this State. Section 9
63 additionally requires the Board to review and make recommendations to the Department
64 regarding technologies to facilitate the exploration by pupils of careers in industries in this
65 State.
66 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve transferable tax credits and abatements or
67 partial abatements of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain
68 businesses in certain circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application
69 for such credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria. (NRS 231.1555,
70 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections
71 10-23 of this bill authorize the Office to require an applicant for transferable tax credits or a
72 tax abatement to enter into an agreement with the Office that includes a plan by the applicant
73 to provide work-based learning opportunities to pupils enrolled in public high schools in this
74 State. Section 8.5 of this bill requires the Department to adopt a definition of “work-based
75 learning opportunity” for the purpose of such agreements.
76 Section 25 of this bill appropriates $2,250,000 to the Department to enter into a contract
77 with a qualified entity to provide professional development regarding personalized,
78 competency-based learning programs and assist the Commission on Innovation and

Senate Amendment No. 874 to Senate Bill No. 403 First Reprint Page 5
79 Excellence in Education in developing recommendations and the Department in implementing
80 such recommendations. Section 25.5 of this bill appropriates to the Department an
81 additional $222,763 for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $279,956 for Fiscal Year 2026-2027
82 for personnel and operating costs to carry out the provisions of this bill.

(d) Ensure that pupils receive timely and differentiated support based upon
their individual learning needs; and
(e) Ensure that pupils are able to apply knowledge learned, create new
knowledge and develop important skills and dispositions relating to such
knowledge.
4. If at least one application to participate in the pilot program is made on
behalf of a school that primarily serves pupils who are at risk or credit deficient, or
in need of credit retrieval, the Department must select at least one such school to

districts for the purpose of increasing:
(1) Understanding of competency-based education; and
(2) Interest in implementing a system of competency-based education.
2. To the extent that money is available for that purpose, the Department of
Education may, through a competitive grants program, distribute any money
appropriated to the Department to carry out the pilot program to provide
competency-based education established pursuant to NRS 389.210. Grants must be
awarded by the Department to schools selected to participate in the program based
upon money available for this purpose.
