Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
2 Education and requires the Commission to develop a statewide vision and
3 implementation plan to improve the public education system in this State. (NRS
4 385.910, 385.920) Section 1 of this bill creates the Subcommittee on Metrics of the
5 Commission and requires the Subcommittee to develop, in collaboration with the
6 Department of Education, metrics for local educational agencies and schools to
7 measure the progress and success of pupils, schools and school districts. Section 2
8 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definition of the term
-
*SB403_R1*
– 2 –
9 “Commission,” which is applicable to provisions governing the Commission on
10 Innovation and Excellence in Education, to the provisions of section 1. Section 2.5
11 of this bill revises the membership of the Commission by adding: (1) the deans of
12 the College of Education at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of
13 Nevada, Las Vegas; and (2) the dean of the School of Education at Nevada State
14 University. Section 24 of this bill makes an appropriation of $68,910 for a staff
15 position to oversee the implementation of recommendations made by the
16 Commission. Section 26 of this bill makes an appropriation of $25,000 for the
17 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $25,000 for the Fiscal Year 2026-2027 for the travel
18 expenses of the members of the Commission and Subcommittee.
19 Existing law requires the Department to establish a pilot program to provide
20 competency-based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines “competency-
21 based education” as a system of instruction by which a pupil advances to a higher
22 level of learning when the pupil demonstrates mastery of a concept or skill,
23 regardless of the time, place or pace at which the pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200)
24 Section 6 of this bill changes the term “competency-based education” to
25 “personalized, competency-based learning,” and revises the definition for that term.
26 Section 4.3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, the
27 governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
28 pupils, a committee to form a charter school or a charter management organization
29 to apply to the Department to provide a program of personalized, competency-
30 based learning and prescribes requirements for the application process. Section 4.4
31 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body
32 of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils to ensure that
33 the program is run in a manner that complies with any applicable statutes,
34 regulations or rules or policies of the school district, charter school or university
35 school. Section 4.5 of this bill authorizes a program of personalized, competency-
36 based learning to be provided on an alternative schedule. Section 4.6 of this bill
37 requires the State Board of Education to adopt regulations to carry out the
38 provisions of sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5.
39 Section 4.2 of this bill requires the Department, not later than July 1, 2040, and
40 at least once every 5 years thereafter, to review and, as necessary, revise its Portrait
41 of a Nevada Learner to align with the educational needs of this State.
42 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts to schedule and
43 provide a minimum of 180 days of free school in the districts under their charge.
44 (NRS 388.090) Existing law authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
45 authorize a school district to provide a program of instruction based on an
46 alternative schedule, including a schedule which involves the reduction of not more
47 than 15 school days to provide a 12-month school program. (NRS 388.090) Section
48 3 of this bill eliminates provisions authorizing the reduction of up to 15 school days
49 to provide for a 12-month school program and instead generally authorizes an
50 alternative schedule for a school to involve a reduction in the number of school
51 days.
52 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to establish a course of
53 study in occupational guidance and counseling and requires such instruction to be
54 made available for pupils in grades 7-12. Existing law requires the board of trustees
55 in each school district to organize and offer the curriculum within the limits of
56 money made available for that purpose. (NRS 389.041) Section 5 of this bill
57 authorizes a local educational agency to develop, maintain and publish on its
58 Internet website recommendations for educational materials and information
59 regarding career exploration suitable for pupils in grades 1-5.
60 Existing law creates the Board of Economic Development, which, among other
61 duties, is required to make recommendations to the Executive Director of the Office
62 of Economic Development relating to the criteria to be used by the Office in
63 providing development resources and making allocations, grants and loans.

64 (NRS 231.033, 231.037) Existing law additionally requires the Board to review and
65 evaluate all programs of economic development in this State and make
66 recommendations to the Legislature for legislation. (NRS 231.037) Section 9 of
67 this bill further requires such recommendations to include recommendations to
68 provide incentives for businesses, including small businesses, to provide
69 opportunities for career exploration to pupils enrolled in public high schools in this
70 State. Section 9 additionally requires the Board to review and make
71 recommendations to the Department regarding technologies to facilitate the
72 exploration by pupils of careers in industries in this State.
73 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve transferable tax credits and
74 abatements or partial abatements of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales
75 and use taxes for certain businesses in certain circumstances. The Office is
76 prohibited from approving an application for such credits or abatements unless the
77 applicant satisfies certain criteria. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330,
78 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections 10-23 of this bill
79 authorize the Office to require an applicant for transferable tax credits or a tax
80 abatement to enter into an agreement with the Office that includes a plan by the
81 applicant to provide work-based learning opportunities to pupils enrolled in public
82 high schools in this State. Section 8.5 of this bill requires the Department to adopt a
83 definition of “work-based learning opportunity” for the purpose of such
84 agreements.
85 Section 25 of this bill appropriates $2,250,000 to the Department to enter into a
86 contract with a qualified entity to provide professional development regarding
87 personalized, competency-based learning programs and assist the Commission on
88 Innovation and Excellence in Education in developing recommendations and the
89 Department in implementing such recommendations.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; creating the Subcommittee on
Metrics of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence
in Education; revising provisions governing competency-
based learning; authorizing an alternative schedule for
public schools; authorizing local educational agencies to
develop, maintain and publish certain materials related to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
2 Education and requires the Commission to develop a statewide vision and
3 implementation plan to improve the public education system in this State. (NRS
4 385.910, 385.920) Section 1 of this bill creates the Subcommittee on Metrics of the
5 Commission and requires the Subcommittee to develop, in collaboration with the
6 Department of Education, metrics for local educational agencies and schools to
7 measure the progress and success of pupils, schools and school districts. Section 2
8 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definition of the term
-
*SB403_R1*

– 2 –
9 “Commission,” which is applicable to provisions governing the Commission on
10 Innovation and Excellence in Education, to the provisions of section 1. Section 2.5
11 of this bill revises the membership of the Commission by adding: (1) the deans of
12 the College of Education at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of
13 Nevada, Las Vegas; and (2) the dean of the School of Education at Nevada State
14 University. Section 24 of this bill makes an appropriation of $68,910 for a staff
15 position to oversee the implementation of recommendations made by the
16 Commission. Section 26 of this bill makes an appropriation of $25,000 for the
17 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $25,000 for the Fiscal Year 2026-2027 for the travel
18 expenses of the members of the Commission and Subcommittee.
19 Existing law requires the Department to establish a pilot program to provide
20 competency-based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines “competency-
21 based education” as a system of instruction by which a pupil advances to a higher
22 level of learning when the pupil demonstrates mastery of a concept or skill,
23 regardless of the time, place or pace at which the pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200)
24 Section 6 of this bill changes the term “competency-based education” to
25 “personalized, competency-based learning,” and revises the definition for that term.
26 Section 4.3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, the
27 governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
28 pupils, a committee to form a charter school or a charter management organization
29 to apply to the Department to provide a program of personalized, competency-
30 based learning and prescribes requirements for the application process. Section 4.4
31 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body
32 of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils to ensure that
33 the program is run in a manner that complies with any applicable statutes,
34 regulations or rules or policies of the school district, charter school or university
35 school. Section 4.5 of this bill authorizes a program of personalized, competency-
36 based learning to be provided on an alternative schedule. Section 4.6 of this bill
37 requires the State Board of Education to adopt regulations to carry out the
