Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education and

5 develop , in collaboration with the Department of Education, metrics for [school districts]
6 local educational agencies and schools to measure the progress and success of pupils, schools
7 and school districts. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definition
8 of the term “Commission,” which is applicable to provisions governing the Commission on
9 Innovation and Excellence in Education, to the provisions of section 1. Section 2.5 of this bill
10 revises the membership of the Commission by adding: (1) the deans of the College of
11 Education at the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas;
12 and (2) the dean of the School of Education at Nevada State University. Section 24 of this

16 2026-2027 for the travel expenses of the members of the Commission and Subcommittee.
17 Existing law requires the Department [of Education] to establish a pilot program to
18 provide competency-based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines “competency-
19 based education” as a system of instruction by which a pupil advances to a higher level of
20 learning when the pupil demonstrates mastery of a concept or skill, regardless of the time,
21 place or pace at which the pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200) [Sections 6-8] Section 6 of this
22 bill [change] changes the term “competency-based education” to [“competency-based]
23 “personalized, competency-based learning,” [but otherwise retain the existing] and revises
24 the definition for that term. [Section 7 authorizes the Department: (1) to create a timeline and
25 action plan to implement alternatives to Carnegie Units or methods to enable the use of
26 Carnegie Units to coexist with the system of instruction used in competency-based learning;
27 and (2) submit recommendations to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education for
28 legislation necessary to implement such alternatives or methods or to authorize the
29 Department to revise or eliminate certain regulations.] Section 4.3 of this bill authorizes the
30 board of trustees of a school district, the governing body of a charter school or university
31 school for profoundly gifted pupils, a committee to form a charter school or a charter
32 management organization to apply to the Department to provide a program of
33 personalized, competency-based learning and prescribes requirements for the
34 application process. Section 4.4 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school
35 district or the governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly
36 gifted pupils to ensure that the program is run in a manner that complies with any
37 applicable statutes, regulations or rules or policies of the school district, charter school
38 or university school. Section 4.5 of this bill authorizes a program of personalized,

48 a school district to provide a program of instruction based on an alternative schedule,
49 including a schedule which involves the reduction of not more than 15 school days to
50 provide a 12-month school program. (NRS 388.090) Section 3 [and 7] of this bill [authorize
51 the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to apply to
52 the Superintendent of Public Instruction for approval of : (1)] eliminates provisions
53 authorizing the reduction of up to 15 school days to provide for a 12-month school
54 program and instead generally authorizes an alternative schedule for a school [which is
55 selected to participate in the pilot program to provide competency-based learning; and (2) an
56 alternative method in which the Superintendent of Public Instruction will count enrollment
57 and calculate the average daily attendance of pupils enrolled in such a school for the purposes
58 of apportionments and allowances from the State Education Fund.] to involve a reduction in
59 the number of school days.
60 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to establish a course of study in
61 occupational guidance and counseling and requires such instruction to be made available for
62 pupils in grades 7-12. Existing law requires the board of trustees in each school district to
63 organize and offer the curriculum within the limits of money made available for that purpose.
64 (NRS 389.041) [Sections 4 and 5 of this bill eliminate the provisions making such instruction
65 optional and instead require the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
66 body of each charter school to ensure that the course is provided to pupils enrolled in grades 6,
67 7 and 8.] Section 5 of this bill [requires the Department] authorizes a local educational
68 agency to develop, maintain and publish on [an] its Internet website [maintained by the
69 Department] recommendations for educational materials and information regarding career
70 exploration suitable for pupils in grades 1-5.

75 additionally requires the Board to review and evaluate all programs of economic development
76 in this State and make recommendations to the Legislature for legislation. (NRS 231.037)
77 Section 9 of this bill further requires such recommendations to include recommendations to
78 provide incentives for businesses, including small businesses, to provide opportunities for
79 career exploration to pupils enrolled in public high schools in this State. Section 9
80 additionally requires the Board to review and make recommendations to the Department
81 regarding technologies to facilitate the exploration by pupils of careers in industries in this
82 State.
83 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve transferable tax credits and abatements or
84 partial abatements of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain
85 businesses in certain circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application
86 for such credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria. (NRS 231.1555,
87 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections

89 tax abatement to enter into an agreement with the Office that includes a plan by the applicant
90 to provide work-based learning opportunities [for career exploration] to pupils enrolled in
91 public high schools in this State. Section 8.5 of this bill requires the Department to adopt a
92 definition of “work-based learning opportunity” for the purpose of such agreements.
93 Section 25 of this bill appropriates $2,250,000 to the Department to [: (1) make grants to

17 Existing law requires the Department [of Education] to establish a pilot program to
18 provide competency-based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines “competency-
19 based education” as a system of instruction by which a pupil advances to a higher level of
20 learning when the pupil demonstrates mastery of a concept or skill, regardless of the time,
21 place or pace at which the pupil progresses. (NRS 389.200) [Sections 6-8] Section 6 of this

53 authorizing the reduction of up to 15 school days to provide for a 12-month school
54 program and instead generally authorizes an alternative schedule for a school [which is
55 selected to participate in the pilot program to provide competency-based learning; and (2) an
56 alternative method in which the Superintendent of Public Instruction will count enrollment
57 and calculate the average daily attendance of pupils enrolled in such a school for the purposes
58 of apportionments and allowances from the State Education Fund.] to involve a reduction in
59 the number of school days.
60 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to establish a course of study in
61 occupational guidance and counseling and requires such instruction to be made available for

63 organize and offer the curriculum within the limits of money made available for that purpose.
64 (NRS 389.041) [Sections 4 and 5 of this bill eliminate the provisions making such instruction
65 optional and instead require the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
