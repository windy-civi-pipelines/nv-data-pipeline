Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
2 Education and requires the Commission to develop a statewide vision and
3 implementation plan to improve the public education system in this State. (NRS
4 385.910, 385.920) Section 1 of this bill creates the Subcommittee on Metrics of the
-
*SB403*

– 2 –
5 Commission and requires the Subcommittee to develop metrics for school districts
6 and schools to measure the progress and success of pupils, schools and school
7 districts. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definition of
8 the term “Commission,” which is applicable to provisions governing the
9 Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, to the provisions of
10 section 1. Section 24 of this bill makes an appropriation of $137,820 for a staff
11 position to oversee the implementation of recommendations made by the
12 Commission. Section 26 of this bill makes an appropriation of $25,000 for the
13 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $25,000 for the Fiscal Year 2026-2027 for the travel
14 expenses of the members of the Commission and Subcommittee.
15 Existing law requires the Department of Education to establish a pilot program
16 to provide competency-based education. (NRS 389.210) Existing law defines
17 “competency-based education” as a system of instruction by which a pupil
18 advances to a higher level of learning when the pupil demonstrates mastery of a
19 concept or skill, regardless of the time, place or pace at which the pupil progresses.
20 (NRS 389.200) Sections 6-8 of this bill change the term “competency-based
21 education” to “competency-based learning,” but otherwise retain the existing
22 definition for that term. Section 7 authorizes the Department: (1) to create a
23 timeline and action plan to implement alternatives to Carnegie Units or methods to
24 enable the use of Carnegie Units to coexist with the system of instruction used in
25 competency-based learning; and (2) submit recommendations to the Joint Interim
26 Standing Committee on Education for legislation necessary to implement such
27 alternatives or methods or to authorize the Department to revise or eliminate certain
28 regulations.
29 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts to schedule and
30 provide a minimum of 180 days of free school in the districts under their charge.
31 (NRS 388.090) Sections 3 and 7 of this bill authorize the board of trustees of a
32 school district or the governing body of a charter school to apply to the
33 Superintendent of Public Instruction for approval of: (1) an alternative schedule for
34 a school which is selected to participate in the pilot program to provide
35 competency-based learning; and (2) an alternative method in which the
36 Superintendent of Public Instruction will count enrollment and calculate the
37 average daily attendance of pupils enrolled in such a school for the purposes of
38 apportionments and allowances from the State Education Fund.
39 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to establish a course of
40 study in occupational guidance and counseling and requires such instruction to be
41 made available for pupils in grades 7-12. Existing law requires the board of trustees
42 in each school district to organize and offer the curriculum within the limits of
43 money made available for that purpose. (NRS 389.041) Sections 4 and 5 of this
44 bill eliminate the provisions making such instruction optional and instead require
45 the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body of each charter
46 school to ensure that the course is provided to pupils enrolled in grades 6, 7 and 8.
47 Section 5 of this bill requires the Department to develop, maintain and publish on
48 an Internet website maintained by the Department educational materials and
49 information regarding career exploration suitable for pupils in grades 1-5.
50 Existing law creates the Board of Economic Development, which, among other
51 duties, is required to make recommendations to the Executive Director of the Office
52 of Economic Development relating to the criteria to be used by the Office in
53 providing development resources and making allocations, grants and loans. (NRS
54 231.033, 231.037) Existing law additionally requires the Board to review and
55 evaluate all programs of economic development in this State and make
56 recommendations to the Legislature for legislation. (NRS 231.037) Section 9 of
57 this bill further requires such recommendations to include recommendations to
58 provide incentives for businesses, including small businesses, to provide
59 opportunities for career exploration to pupils enrolled in public schools in this
-
*SB403*

– 3 –
60 State. Section 9 additionally requires the Board to review and make
61 recommendations to the Department regarding technologies to facilitate the
62 exploration by pupils of careers in industries in this State.
63 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve transferable tax credits and
64 abatements or partial abatements of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales
65 and use taxes for certain businesses in certain circumstances. The Office is
66 prohibited from approving an application for such credits or abatements unless the
67 applicant satisfies certain criteria. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330,
68 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections 10-23 of this bill
69 authorize the Office to require an applicant for transferable tax credits or a tax
70 abatement to enter into an agreement with the Office that includes a plan by the
71 applicant to provide opportunities for career exploration to pupils enrolled in public
72 schools in this State.
73 Section 25 of this bill appropriates $2,250,000 to the Department to: (1) make
74 grants to school districts to assist schools in participating in the pilot program to
75 provide competency-based learning; and (2) enter into a contract with a qualified
76 entity to provide professional development regarding competency-based learning
77 programs and assist the Department in implementing the recommendations made
78 by the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.
