AN ACT relating to dentistry; enacting the Dentist and Dental
Hygienist Compact; providing dentists and dental
hygienists practicing in this State under the Compact with
the same legal status as persons who are licensed to
practice those professions in this State; authorizing the
sharing of certain information with a data system created
by the Compact; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists and dental
2 hygienists in this State by the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada. (Chapter 631
3 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill enacts the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact,
4 which allows a person who is licensed as a dentist or a dental hygienist in a state
5 that is participating in the Compact to practice in other states that are participating
6 in the Compact.
7 In order to practice as a dentist or dental hygienist under the Compact, the
8 Compact requires a person to: (1) hold an unencumbered license in a state that is
9 participating in the Compact; (2) meet any requirement in the state in which he or
10 she seeks to practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her
11 knowledge of the applicable laws and rules of that state; (3) submit to an
12 application process and pay any applicable fees; (4) have passed certain
13 examinations; (5) have graduated from certain programs for the education of
14 dentists or dental hygienists; (6) have completed a clinical assessment for licensure;
15 (7) report any adverse action taken against him or her within 30 days after the date
16 the adverse action is taken; (8) function within the scope of practice authorized by
17 each state in which he or she seeks to practice; and (9) meet certain other
18 requirements for eligibility. The Compact authorizes a participating state to take
19 adverse action against a dentist or dental hygienist who is practicing in the
20 participating state under the Compact.

*AB143*
– 2 –
21 The Compact requires participating states to create a joint government agency
22 called the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact Commission. The Compact sets
23 forth the powers of the Commission which include, among other powers, the power
24 to adopt rules and bylaws and to hold meetings, which may be closed under certain
25 circumstances. The Compact additionally authorizes the Commission to levy and
26 collect an annual assessment from participating states and impose fees upon
27 persons seeking to practice under the Compact to cover the cost of its operations.
28 The Compact requires the Commission to create a data system to facilitate the
29 sharing of information among participating states. Section 2 of this bill, in general,
30 authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to disclose information to that
31 data system when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill provides for the
32 confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data system.
33 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
34 including providing procedures for the taking of adverse actions against licensees,
35 provisions for rulemaking by the Commission, provisions for oversight, dispute
36 resolution and enforcement and procedures for amendments and withdrawals.
37 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a dentist or dental hygienist under the
38 Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a license issued by the Board, thereby
39 providing such persons with the same authority, duties and legal protections as a
40 licensee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 631 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 The Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact is hereby ratified
4 and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining the

9 SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
10
11 This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental
12 Hygienist Compact. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate
13 the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve
14 public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
15 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State
16 the ability to practice in Participating States in which they are not
17 licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
18 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to
19 obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in
20 another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
21 Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health
22 and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
23 Hygienists, through the State’s authority to regulate the practice
24 of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
-

6 through each Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact
7 Privilege to practice in that State;
8 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and
9 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway
10 for Licensees to practice in Participating States;
11 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
12 public’s health and safety;
13 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established
14 by a Participating State;
15 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary
16 information among Participating States;
17 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
18 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice
19 within the Scope of Practice authorized in that State;
20 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate
21 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to
22 Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a
23 Compact Privilege;
24 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
25 regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within

24 Hygienist holds a License or Compact Privilege.
25 E. A Remote State shall have the authority to:
26 1. Take Adverse Actions as set forth in Section 4.D against
27 a Licensee’s Compact Privilege in the State;
28 2. In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the
29 Compact and the Commission’s Rules issue subpoenas for both
30 hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
31 testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. Subpoenas
32 issued by a State Licensing Authority in a Participating State for
33 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of
34 evidence from another Participating State, shall be enforced in the
35 latter State by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to
36 the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas
37 issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority
38 shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees
39 required by the service statutes of the State where the witnesses or

28 responsibilities, or as determined by the Commission that the
29 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
30 believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment,
31 duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be
32 construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel

9 otherwise abrogate a Participating State’s state action immunity or
10 state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims
11 under the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other State or federal

16
17 SECTION 8. DATA SYSTEM
18

20 maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated database

22 SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
23
24 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
25 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
26 purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall
27 be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent
28 jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission
29 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
30 scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
31 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
32 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law
33 in each Participating State, provided however that where the Rules
34 of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State
35 that establish the Participating State’s Scope of Practice as held by
36 a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission
37 shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
38 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers
39 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules
40 adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the date
41 specified by the Commission for each Rule.

43 rejects a Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by
44 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
45 adopt the Compact, within four (4) years of the date of adoption of
-
*AB143*
– 20 –
1 the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in
2 any Participating State or to any State applying to participate in
3 the Compact.
4 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
5 the Commission.
6 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission
7 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and

10 and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the
11 Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the
12 Commission shall provide a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
13 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly
14 accessible platform;
15 2. To persons who have requested notice of the
16 Commission’s notices of proposed rulemaking, and

18 specify.
19 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
20 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at
21 which the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed
22 Rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting
23 where the Commission will consider and vote on the proposed
24 Rule;
25 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
26 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
27 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of
28 Proposed Rulemaking;
29 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
30 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any

35 all written comments and documents received by the Commission
36 in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
37 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
38 separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be
39 grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings
40 required by this section.
41 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all
42 Commissioners, take final action on the proposed Rule based on
43 the rulemaking record.
-
*AB143*
– 21 –

2 Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of
3 the proposed Rule.
4 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the
5 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well
6 as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
7 recommended by commenters.
8 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective
9 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in
10 subsection L of this section, the effective date of the Rule shall be
11 no sooner than thirty (30) days after the Commission issuing the
12 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
13 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the
14 Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24
15 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the
16 usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this
17 section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as
18 reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
19 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision,
20 an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in

23 welfare;
24 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State
25 funds;
26 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
27 established by federal law or rule; or

29 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the
30 Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for
31 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
32 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
33 revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
34 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of
35 thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
36 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a
37 Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
38 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge
39 is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
40 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
41 approval of the Commission.
42 N. No Participating State’s rulemaking requirements shall
43 apply under this Compact.

1 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND
2 ENFORCEMENT
3
4 A. Oversight
5 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government
6 in each Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all
7 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
8 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against
9 the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court
10 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the
11 Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and
12 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
13 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
14 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
15 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice,
16 misconduct or any such similar matter.
17 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
18 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
19 interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall have
20 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.
21 Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render
22 a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or
23 promulgated Rules.
24 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
25 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State
26 has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or
27 responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the
28 Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State.
29 The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed
30 means of curing the default, and any other action that the
31 Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific
32 technical assistance regarding the default.
33 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
34 default to the other Participating States.
35 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
36 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
37 vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges
38 and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
39 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
40 default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or
41 liabilities incurred during the period of default.
42 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be
43 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
44 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
45 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
-
*AB143*
– 23 –
1 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
2 defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as

10 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
11 Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other Participating
12 States issued a Compact Privilege to practice within that State, of
13 such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize
14 all Compact Privileges then in effect in that State for a minimum
15 of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
16 termination.
17 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
18 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
19 Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission
20 and the defaulting State.
21 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
22 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
23 of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
24 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
25 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
26 I. Dispute Resolution
27 1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission
28 shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
29 among Participating States and between Participating States and
30 non-Participating States.
31 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
32 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
33 appropriate.
34 J. Enforcement
35 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
36 discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the
37 Commission’s Rules.
38 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal
39 action against a Participating State in default in the United States
40 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
41 where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce
42 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
43 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
44 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
45 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
-
*AB143*
– 24 –
1 including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
2 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission
3 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
4 defaulting Participating State’s law.
5 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
6 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
7 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
8 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact
9 and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
10 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
11 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
12 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State
14 may enforce this Compact against the Commission.

17 AMENDMENT
18
19 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which

41 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
42 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
43 prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission
44 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the
45 Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
-
*AB143*
– 25 –
1 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
2 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
3 subject to the Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the
4 date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule
5 that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the
6 full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in
7 that State.
8 B. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact
9 by enacting a statute repealing that State’s enactment of the

A.B. 143
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 143–ASSEMBLYMEMBER MARZOLA
PREFILED JANUARY 29, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Enacts the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact.
(BDR 54-877)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to dentistry; enacting the Dentist and Dental
Hygienist Compact; providing dentists and dental
hygienists practicing in this State under the Compact with
the same legal status as persons who are licensed to
practice those professions in this State; authorizing the
sharing of certain information with a data system created
by the Compact; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists and dental
2 hygienists in this State by the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada. (Chapter 631
3 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill enacts the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact,
4 which allows a person who is licensed as a dentist or a dental hygienist in a state
5 that is participating in the Compact to practice in other states that are participating
6 in the Compact.
7 In order to practice as a dentist or dental hygienist under the Compact, the
8 Compact requires a person to: (1) hold an unencumbered license in a state that is
9 participating in the Compact; (2) meet any requirement in the state in which he or
10 she seeks to practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her
11 knowledge of the applicable laws and rules of that state; (3) submit to an
12 application process and pay any applicable fees; (4) have passed certain
13 examinations; (5) have graduated from certain programs for the education of
14 dentists or dental hygienists; (6) have completed a clinical assessment for licensure;
15 (7) report any adverse action taken against him or her within 30 days after the date
16 the adverse action is taken; (8) function within the scope of practice authorized by
17 each state in which he or she seeks to practice; and (9) meet certain other
18 requirements for eligibility. The Compact authorizes a participating state to take
19 adverse action against a dentist or dental hygienist who is practicing in the
20 participating state under the Compact.
-
*AB143*

– 2 –
21 The Compact requires participating states to create a joint government agency
22 called the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact Commission. The Compact sets
23 forth the powers of the Commission which include, among other powers, the power
24 to adopt rules and bylaws and to hold meetings, which may be closed under certain
25 circumstances. The Compact additionally authorizes the Commission to levy and
26 collect an annual assessment from participating states and impose fees upon
27 persons seeking to practice under the Compact to cover the cost of its operations.
28 The Compact requires the Commission to create a data system to facilitate the
29 sharing of information among participating states. Section 2 of this bill, in general,
30 authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to disclose information to that
31 data system when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill provides for the
32 confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data system.
33 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
34 including providing procedures for the taking of adverse actions against licensees,
35 provisions for rulemaking by the Commission, provisions for oversight, dispute
36 resolution and enforcement and procedures for amendments and withdrawals.
37 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a dentist or dental hygienist under the
38 Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a license issued by the Board, thereby
39 providing such persons with the same authority, duties and legal protections as a
40 licensee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 631 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 The Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact is hereby ratified
4 and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining the
5 Compact, in substantially the form set forth in this section:

7 DENTIST AND DENTAL HYGIENIST COMPACT
8
9 SECTION 1. TITLE AND PURPOSE
10
11 This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental
12 Hygienist Compact. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate
13 the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve
14 public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing
15 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State
16 the ability to practice in Participating States in which they are not
17 licensed. The Compact does this by establishing a pathway for
18 Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a Participating State to
19 obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to practice in
20 another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
21 Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health
22 and safety with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental
23 Hygienists, through the State’s authority to regulate the practice
24 of dentistry and dental hygiene in the State. The Compact:
-

2 Compact Privilege to practice in other Participating States without
3 satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated

5 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages
6 through each Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact
7 Privilege to practice in that State;
8 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and
9 Dental Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway
10 for Licensees to practice in Participating States;
11 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
12 public’s health and safety;
13 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established
14 by a Participating State;
15 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary
16 information among Participating States;
17 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
18 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice
19 within the Scope of Practice authorized in that State;
20 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate
21 the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to
22 Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a
23 Compact Privilege;
24 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in
25 regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within
26 those States; and

26 1. Take Adverse Actions as set forth in Section 4.D against
27 a Licensee’s Compact Privilege in the State;
28 2. In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the
29 Compact and the Commission’s Rules issue subpoenas for both
30 hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
31 testimony of witnesses, and the production of evidence. Subpoenas
32 issued by a State Licensing Authority in a Participating State for
33 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of
34 evidence from another Participating State, shall be enforced in the
35 latter State by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to
36 the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas
37 issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority

17 report the presence of such information to the Data System as
18 required by Section 8.B.6 as if it was Significant Investigative
19 Information.

20 maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated database
21 and reporting system containing licensure, Adverse Action, and
22 the presence of Significant Investigative Information on all
23 Licensees and applicants for a License in Participating States.
24 B. Notwithstanding any other provision of State law to the
25 contrary, a Participating State shall submit a uniform data set to
26 the Data System on all individuals to whom this Compact is
27 applicable as required by the Rules of the Commission, including:
28 1. Identifying information;
29 2. Licensure data;
30 3. Adverse Actions against a Licensee, License applicant or

21
22 SECTION 9. RULEMAKING
23
24 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
25 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
26 purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule shall
27 be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent
28 jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission
29 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
30 scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
31 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
32 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law
33 in each Participating State, provided however that where the Rules
34 of the Commission conflict with the laws of the Participating State
35 that establish the Participating State’s Scope of Practice as held by
36 a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission
37 shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
38 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers
39 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the Rules
40 adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the date
41 specified by the Commission for each Rule.
42 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States
43 rejects a Commission Rule or portion of a Commission Rule, by
44 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
45 adopt the Compact, within four (4) years of the date of adoption of
-
*AB143*

– 20 –
1 the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect in
2 any Participating State or to any State applying to participate in
3 the Compact.
4 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
5 the Commission.
6 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission
7 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and
8 written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
9 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission,
10 and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the
11 Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the
12 Commission shall provide a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
13 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly
14 accessible platform;
15 2. To persons who have requested notice of the
16 Commission’s notices of proposed rulemaking, and
17 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule
18 specify.
19 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
20 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at
21 which the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed
22 Rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting
23 where the Commission will consider and vote on the proposed
24 Rule;
25 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
26 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
27 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of
28 Proposed Rulemaking;
29 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
30 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
31 interested person; and
32 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit
33 written comments.
34 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and
35 all written comments and documents received by the Commission
36 in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
37 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
38 separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be
39 grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings
40 required by this section.
41 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all
42 Commissioners, take final action on the proposed Rule based on
43 the rulemaking record.
-
*AB143*

– 21 –
1 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed
2 Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of
3 the proposed Rule.
4 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the
5 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well
6 as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
7 recommended by commenters.
8 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective
9 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in
10 subsection L of this section, the effective date of the Rule shall be
11 no sooner than thirty (30) days after the Commission issuing the
12 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
13 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the
14 Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24
15 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the
16 usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this
17 section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as
18 reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
19 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision,
20 an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in
21 order to:
22 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
23 welfare;
24 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State
25 funds;
26 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
27 established by federal law or rule; or
28 4. Protect public health and safety.
29 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the
30 Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for
31 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
32 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
33 revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
34 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of
35 thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
36 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a
37 Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
38 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge
39 is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
40 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
41 approval of the Commission.
42 N. No Participating State’s rulemaking requirements shall
43 apply under this Compact.

1 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND
2 ENFORCEMENT
3
4 A. Oversight
5 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government
6 in each Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all
7 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
8 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against
9 the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court
10 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the
11 Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and
12 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
13 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
14 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
15 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice,
16 misconduct or any such similar matter.
17 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
18 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
19 interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall have
20 standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.
21 Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render
22 a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or
23 promulgated Rules.
24 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
25 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State
26 has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or
27 responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the
28 Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State.
29 The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed
30 means of curing the default, and any other action that the
31 Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific
32 technical assistance regarding the default.
33 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
34 default to the other Participating States.
35 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
36 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
37 vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges
38 and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be
39 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
40 default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or
41 liabilities incurred during the period of default.
42 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be
43 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
44 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
45 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
-
*AB143*

– 23 –
1 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
2 defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority or Authorities, as
3 applicable, and each of the Participating States’ State Licensing
4 Authority or Authorities, as applicable.
5 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
6 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
7 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
8 beyond the effective date of termination.
9 F. Upon the termination of a State’s participation in this
10 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
11 Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other Participating
12 States issued a Compact Privilege to practice within that State, of
13 such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize
14 all Compact Privileges then in effect in that State for a minimum
15 of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
16 termination.
17 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
18 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
19 Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission
20 and the defaulting State.
21 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
22 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
23 of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
24 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
25 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
26 I. Dispute Resolution
27 1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission
28 shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
29 among Participating States and between Participating States and
30 non-Participating States.
31 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
32 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
33 appropriate.
34 J. Enforcement
35 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
36 discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the
37 Commission’s Rules.
38 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal
39 action against a Participating State in default in the United States
40 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
41 where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce
42 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
43 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
44 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
45 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
-
*AB143*

– 24 –
1 including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
2 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission
3 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
4 defaulting Participating State’s law.
5 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
6 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
7 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
8 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact
9 and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
10 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
11 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
12 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 4. No individual or entity other than a Participating State
14 may enforce this Compact against the Commission.
15
16 SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND
17 AMENDMENT
18
19 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which
20 the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh
21 Participating State.
22 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the
23 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of
24 the States that enacted the Compact prior to the Commission
25 convening (“Charter Participating States”) to determine if the
26 statute enacted by each such Charter Participating State is
27 materially different than the Model Compact.
28 a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is
29 found to be materially different from the Model Compact shall be
30 entitled to the default process set forth in Section 10.
31 b. If any Participating State is later found to be in
32 default, or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the
33 Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact shall
34 remain in effect even if the number of Participating States should
35 be less than seven (7).
36 2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to
37 the Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set
38 forth in Section 7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are
39 materially different from the Model Compact and whether they
40 qualify for participation in the Compact.
41 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
42 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
43 prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission
44 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the
45 Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
-
*AB143*

– 25 –
1 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
2 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
3 subject to the Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the
4 date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule
5 that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the
6 full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in
7 that State.
8 B. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact
9 by enacting a statute repealing that State’s enactment of the
10 Compact.
11 1. A Participating State’s withdrawal shall not take effect
12 until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the
13 repealing statute.
14 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement
15 of the withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority or Authorities to
16 comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
17 requirements of this Compact prior to the effective date of
18 withdrawal.
19 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
20 Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice of such
21 withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any
22 subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
23 State shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges to practice
24 within that State granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum
25 of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of
26 withdrawal.
27 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
28 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
29 arrangement between a Participating State and a non-
30 Participating State that does not conflict with the provisions of this
31 Compact.
32 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States.
33 No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and
34 binding upon any Participating State until it is enacted into the
35 laws of all Participating States.
36
37 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
38
39 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority
40 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and
41 the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions
42 of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
43 promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the
44 Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
-
*AB143*

– 26 –
1 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if
2 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held
3 by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
4 constitution of any Participating State, a State seeking
5 participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the
6 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
7 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
8 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this
9 Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
10 agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
11 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the
12 Commission may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or,
13 in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a
14 Participating State’s participation in the Compact, if it determines
15 that a constitutional requirement of a Participating State is a
16 material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact
17 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Participating
18 State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the
19 remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as to
20 the Participating State affected as to all severable matters.
21
22 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
23 OTHER STATE LAWS
24
25 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
26 any other law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with
27 the Compact.
28 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
29 in a Participating State in conflict with the Compact are
30 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
31 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and
32 the Participating States are binding in accordance with their
33 terms.

13 of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
14 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
15 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
16 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum

25 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

27 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
28 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
29 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
30 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

33 electronically, the confidential information from the information
34 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
35 confidential.

37 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
38 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
39 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
40 means of an electronic medium if:
41 (a) The public record:
42 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
43 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
44 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
45 means of an electronic medium would:

5 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
6 has legal custody or control of a public record:
7 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

9 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
10 medium.
11 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
12 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
