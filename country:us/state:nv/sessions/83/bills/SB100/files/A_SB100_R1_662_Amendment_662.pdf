Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a public officer or other person, upon whom any duty is imposed
2 under the provisions governing the election laws of this State, who willfully neglects his or
3 her duty or willfully performs the duty in such a way as to hinder the objects and purposes of
4 the election laws is guilty of a category E felony, which is punishable by a minimum term of
5 imprisonment of 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 4 years and may be subject to a
6 fine of not more than $5,000. If the person is a public officer and is convicted of this offense,
7 his or her office is forfeited. (NRS 293.800) [Section 2 of this bill provides that a public
8 officer or other person who is charged with certain duties relating to an election who willfully
9 fails to perform his or her duties in a timely manner by the applicable deadline set forth in
10 statute or regulation is also guilty of a category E felony and subject to these penalties.]
11 Section 1 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations to ensure certain
12 duties relating to an election are completed and carried out in a timely manner. Section 1
13 requires a public officer or other person to notify the Secretary of State and the Attorney
14 General whether he or she will be able to perform such a duty by the deadline. Section 1 also
15 provides that if a public officer or other person who represents or is employed by a county or
16 city, upon whom a duty set forth in the regulations adopted by the Secretary of State, fails to
17 perform his or her duty in a timely manner by the deadline, the Secretary of State must: (1)
18 notify the governing body of the county or city that employs or oversees the public officer or
19 other person or the public officer, if the public officer is not employed or overseen by the
20 governing body of the county or city; and (2) offer to assist the public officer or other person
21 in carrying out the duty. Section 1 further provides that after providing notice: (1) if the
22 governing body or public officer fails to initiate action, the Secretary of State is required to
23 refer a complaint for prosecution to the Attorney General; and (2) the Secretary of State may
24 seek a writ of mandamus to compel the public officer or other person to perform the duty if
25 the public officer or other person fails to initiate action to perform the duty not more than 72
26 hours after receiving notice from the Secretary of State.
