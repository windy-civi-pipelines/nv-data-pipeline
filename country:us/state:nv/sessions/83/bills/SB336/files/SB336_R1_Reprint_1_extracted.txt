MARCH 12, 2025

Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Establishes provisions relating to portable benefit
accounts. (BDR 53-621)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to compensation; authorizing a sole proprietor or
independent contractor to open a portable benefit account
under certain circumstances; authorizing certain
contributions to and disbursements from a portable
benefit account under certain circumstances; setting forth
certain restrictions on the consideration by the Labor
Commissioner of a contribution to a portable benefit
account in determining whether the holder of the account
should be classified as an employee; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill authorizes a natural person who is a sole proprietor or an
2 independent contractor to open and contribute to a portable benefit account, under
3 certain circumstances, which may be used for the benefit of the account holder or a
4 spouse, domestic partner, child or other dependent of the account holder. Section 3
5 of this bill authorizes the money in a portable benefit account to be used for the
6 payment of costs for: (1) maintaining health insurance coverage; (2) coverage for or
7 the purchase of prescription drugs; (3) any agreement or arrangement for the
8 payment of medical expenses; (4) other out-of-pocket medical expenses; or (5)
9 other benefits, including income replacement insurance, life insurance or an
10 individual retirement account.
11 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts for the services of a sole
12 proprietor or an independent contractor to contribute money to a portable benefit
13 account which is held by the sole proprietor or independent contractor. Section 4
14 authorizes, under certain circumstances, such a contribution to be based on
15 withholding a percentage of payment otherwise owed to the sole proprietor or
16 independent contractor.
17 Existing law requires the Labor Commissioner, the Attorney General and
18 certain state agencies to share certain information relating to suspected or actual

19 employee misclassification. (NRS 607.217) Existing law also authorizes the Labor
20 Commissioner to impose various administrative penalties against an employer who
21 misclassifies a person as an independent contractor or otherwise fails to properly
22 classify a person as an employee. (NRS 608.400, 608.410) Section 4 provides that
23 the fact that a contribution is made to a portable benefit account is, in and of itself,
24 insufficient to support any determination by the Labor Commissioner as to whether
25 or not the holder of the account should be classified as an employee. If the Labor
26 Commissioner considers such a contribution in any proceeding or determination
27 relating to the classification of the holder of the account, section 4 requires the
28 Labor Commissioner to make at least three additional findings of fact in support of
29 any determination that a person was not properly classified.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 608 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. A natural person who is a resident of this State

5 proprietor or an independent contractor during the calendar year
6 in which the person opens the account.
7 2. The holder of a portable benefit account may make
8 contributions to the portable benefit account during any calendar
9 year in which the holder works as a sole proprietor or independent
10 contractor.
11 3. Distributions from a portable benefit account that are
12 made in compliance with the requirements of section 3 of this act
13 may be used for the benefit of the holder of the account or a
14 spouse, domestic partner, child or other dependent of the holder of
15 the account.
16 4. As used in this section, “portable benefit account” means
17 an account that meets the requirements of section 3 of this act.
18 Sec. 3. 1. A portable benefit account must be offered
19 through and administered by a bank, credit union, investment
20 manager or other provider or program that offers services through
21 a bank, credit union or investment manager.
22 2. Distributions from a portable benefit account may only be
23 made for the:

26 without limitation, premiums, copays, deductibles or coinsurance;
27 (2) Coverage for or the purchase of prescription drugs;

– 3 –
1 (b) Payment of costs relating to or an investment in other
2 benefits, including, without limitation, income replacement
3 insurance, life insurance or an individual retirement account.
4 3. As used in this section:
5 (a) “Bank” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 657.016.
6 (b) “Credit union” has the meaning ascribed to it in
7 NRS 672.070.
8 Sec. 4. 1. A person who contracts for the services of a sole
9 proprietor or an independent contractor may contribute money to

13 based on withholding a percentage of payment otherwise owed to
14 the sole proprietor or independent contractor, if:
15 (a) In the contract for services or a notice accompanying the
16 contract, an explanation of the optional withholding is clear,
17 unambiguous and prominently displayed;
18 (b) The contract for services or a notice accompanying the
19 contract requires the sole proprietor or independent contractor to
20 indicate his or her intention to opt in or opt out of the
21 withholding;
22 (c) The sole proprietor or independent contractor expressly
23 agrees in writing to opt in to the withholding; and
24 (d) The sole proprietor or independent contractor has the right
25 to opt out of the withholding at any time without penalty.
26 3. The fact that a contribution is made to a portable benefit
27 account pursuant to this section is, in and of itself, insufficient to
28 support any determination by the Labor Commissioner as to
29 whether or not the holder of the account should be classified as an
30 employee. If the Labor Commissioner considers any such
31 contribution in any proceeding or determination relating to such
32 classification, including, without limitation, pursuant to NRS
33 607.217, 608.0155, 608.400 or 608.410, the Labor Commissioner
34 shall not make a determination that a person was not properly
35 classified unless the Labor Commissioner makes at least three
36 other findings of fact in support of the determination.
37 4. As used in this section, “portable benefit account” means
38 an account that meets the requirements of section 3 of this act.
39 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
