AN ACT relating to compensation; authorizing a sole proprietor or independent
contractor to open a portable benefit account under certain
circumstances; authorizing certain contributions to and disbursements
from a portable benefit account under certain circumstances;
[providing that any] setting forth certain restrictions on the
consideration by the Labor Commissioner of a contribution to a
portable benefit account [must not be construed to affect any
determination as to] in determining whether the holder of the account
should be classified as an employee; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill authorizes a natural person who is a sole proprietor or an
2 independent contractor to open and contribute to a portable benefit account, under certain
3 circumstances, which may be used for the benefit of the account holder or a spouse, domestic
4 partner, child or other dependent of the account holder. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the
5 money in a portable benefit account to be used for the payment of costs for: (1) maintaining
6 health insurance coverage; (2) coverage for or the purchase of prescription drugs; (3) any
7 agreement or arrangement for the payment of medical expenses; (4) other out-of-pocket
8 medical expenses; or (5) other benefits, including income replacement insurance, life
9 insurance or an individual retirement account.
10 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts for the services of a sole
11 proprietor or an independent contractor to contribute money to a portable benefit account
12 which is held by the sole proprietor or independent contractor. Section 4 authorizes, under
13 certain circumstances, such a contribution to be based on withholding a percentage of
14 payment otherwise owed to the sole proprietor or independent contractor.
15 Existing law requires the Labor Commissioner, the Attorney General and certain state
16 agencies to share certain information relating to suspected or actual employee
17 misclassification. (NRS 607.217) Existing law also authorizes the Labor Commissioner to
18 impose various administrative penalties against an employer who misclassifies a person as an
19 independent contractor or otherwise fails to properly classify a person as an employee. (NRS
20 608.400, 608.410) Section 4 [: (1)] provides that the fact that a contribution is made to a
21 portable benefit account [must not be construed to affect] is, in and of itself, insufficient to
22 support any determination by the Labor Commissioner as to whether or not the holder of

Senate Amendment No. 414 to Senate Bill No. 336 Page 4
23 the account should be classified as an employee . [; and (2) prohibits the consideration of
24 information or evidence relating to] If the Labor Commissioner considers such a
25 contribution [made to a portable benefit account] in any proceeding or determination relating
26 to the classification of the holder of the account [.] , section 4 requires the Labor
27 Commissioner to make at least three additional findings of fact in support of any
28 determination that a person was not properly classified.
