11 Fund in the State Treasury and requires that money in the Fund be used to carry out
12 the supportive housing grant program. (NRS 319.610)
13 Section 2 of this bill changes the designation of the Nevada Supportive
14 Housing Development Fund from a special revenue fund in the State Treasury to an
15 account in the State General Fund. Section 2 also provides that the money in the
16 redesignated Nevada Supportive Housing Development Account does not revert to
17 the State General Fund at the end of any fiscal year. Section 1 of this bill makes a
18 conforming change to reflect the change in designation of the Fund.
