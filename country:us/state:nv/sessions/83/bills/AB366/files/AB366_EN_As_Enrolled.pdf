Assembly Bill No. 366–Assemblymember Monroe-Moreno
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to housing; revising provisions relating to the
Nevada Supportive Housing Development Fund; making an
appropriation; requiring, under certain circumstances, the
Governor to submit a statement to the Legislature relating to
supportive housing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
Industry, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such a purpose, to
develop and implement a grant program for the purpose of awarding grants for the
development of subsidized housing and the provision of services to assist eligible
persons by reducing barriers to their retention of housing. The program is required
to include a process for applying for a grant to: (1) procure and develop such
supportive housing; (2) train and build the capacity of a supportive housing
partnership; (3) fund the operation of a supportive housing partnership; and (4)
analyze the progress of supportive housing in this State. (NRS 319.600)
Additionally, existing law creates the Nevada Supportive Housing Development
Fund in the State Treasury and requires that money in the Fund be used to carry out
the supportive housing grant program. (NRS 319.610)
Section 1 of this bill removes the provision that the development and
implementation of such a grant program by the Housing Division is subject to the
availability of funds appropriated for such a purpose.
Section 2 of this bill changes the designation of the Nevada Supportive
Housing Development Fund from a special revenue fund in the State Treasury to an
account in the State General Fund. Section 2 also provides that the money in the
redesignated Nevada Supportive Housing Development Account does not revert to
the State General Fund at the end of any fiscal year. Section 1 makes a conforming
change to reflect the change in designation of the Fund.
Section 3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada Supportive Housing
Development Account to carry out the supportive housing grant program. Section
3.5 of this bill requires, beginning with the executive budget for the 2027-2029
biennium, that if the Governor does not include a budgetary request for any amount
of money for the Account to carry out the program, the Governor must submit a
statement with the proposed executive budget outlining the reasons that the
Governor has not included a budgetary request for that purpose.
