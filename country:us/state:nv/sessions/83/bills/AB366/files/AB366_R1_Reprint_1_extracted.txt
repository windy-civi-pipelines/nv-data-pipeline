EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; revising provisions relating to the
Nevada Supportive Housing Development Fund; making
an appropriation; requiring, under certain circumstances,
the Governor to submit a statement to the Legislature
relating to supportive housing; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
2 Industry, subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such a purpose, to
3 develop and implement a grant program for the purpose of awarding grants for the
4 development of subsidized housing and the provision of services to assist eligible
5 persons by reducing barriers to their retention of housing. The program is required
6 to include a process for applying for a grant to: (1) procure and develop such
7 supportive housing; (2) train and build the capacity of a supportive housing
8 partnership; (3) fund the operation of a supportive housing partnership; and (4)
9 analyze the progress of supportive housing in this State. (NRS 319.600)
10 Additionally, existing law creates the Nevada Supportive Housing Development
11 Fund in the State Treasury and requires that money in the Fund be used to carry out
12 the supportive housing grant program. (NRS 319.610)
13 Section 1 of this bill removes the provision that the development and
14 implementation of such a grant program by the Housing Division is subject to the
15 availability of funds appropriated for such a purpose.
16 Section 2 of this bill changes the designation of the Nevada Supportive
17 Housing Development Fund from a special revenue fund in the State Treasury to an
18 account in the State General Fund. Section 2 also provides that the money in the
19 redesignated Nevada Supportive Housing Development Account does not revert to
20 the State General Fund at the end of any fiscal year. Section 1 makes a conforming
21 change to reflect the change in designation of the Fund.
