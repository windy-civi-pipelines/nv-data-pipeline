SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to housing. (BDR 25-814)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included in
Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; [changing the designation of] revising provisions
relating to the Nevada Supportive Housing Development Fund;
making an appropriation; requiring, under certain circumstances,
the Governor to submit a statement to the Legislature relating to
supportive housing; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry,
2 subject to the availability of funds appropriated for such a purpose, to develop and implement
3 a grant program for the purpose of awarding grants for the development of subsidized housing
4 and the provision of services to assist eligible persons by reducing barriers to their retention of
5 housing. The program is required to include a process for applying for a grant to: (1) procure
6 and develop such supportive housing; (2) train and build the capacity of a supportive housing
7 partnership; (3) fund the operation of a supportive housing partnership; and (4) analyze the
8 progress of supportive housing in this State. (NRS 319.600) Additionally, existing law creates
9 the Nevada Supportive Housing Development Fund in the State Treasury and requires that
10 money in the Fund be used to carry out the supportive housing grant program. (NRS 319.610)
11 Section 1 of this bill removes the provision that the development and
12 implementation of such a grant program by the Housing Division is subject to the
13 availability of funds appropriated for such a purpose.
14 Section 2 of this bill changes the designation of the Nevada Supportive Housing
15 Development Fund from a special revenue fund in the State Treasury to an account in the
16 State General Fund. Section 2 also provides that the money in the redesignated Nevada
17 Supportive Housing Development Account does not revert to the State General Fund at the
18 end of any fiscal year. Section 1 [of this bill] makes a conforming change to reflect the change
19 in designation of the Fund.
20 Section 3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada Supportive Housing
21 Development Account to carry out the supportive housing grant program. Section 3.5 of this
22 bill requires, beginning with the executive budget for the 2027-2029 biennium, that if the
23 Governor does not include a budgetary request for any amount of money for the
24 Account to carry out the program, the Governor must submit a statement with the
25 proposed executive budget outlining the reasons that the Governor has not included a
26 budgetary request for that purpose.
