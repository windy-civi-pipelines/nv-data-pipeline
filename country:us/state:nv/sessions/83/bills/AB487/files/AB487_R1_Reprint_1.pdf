AN ACT relating to animals; prohibiting a retail pet store from

transferring ownership of any dog or cat; providing that
an operator of a retail pet store that commits such an act is
guilty of a misdemeanor; revising provisions governing
the sale of dogs and cats; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for retailers and dealers who sell
2 dogs or cats. (NRS 574.450-574.510) Section 8 of this bill revises the term
3 “retailer” to “retail pet store” and revises the definition for purposes of such
4 requirements to mean a commercial establishment in the business of acquiring
5 animals for resale that sells or offers to sell such animals to consumers on the
6 premises of the business. Section 6 of this bill provides that the definition of
7 “dealer” does not include a “retail pet store.”
8 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a retail pet store from selling, offering to sell,
9 bartering, auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any dog or cat. Section
10 2 further: (1) provides that an operator of a retail pet store that violates this
11 prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) authorizes the court to prohibit such
12 a person from selling any dogs or cats that he or she is otherwise authorized to sell
13 as a breeder or dealer for not more than 1 year. Finally, section 2 provides that, for
14 purposes of prosecuting a violation of section 2, each act that constitutes a violation
15 is a separate offense.
16 Section 7.5 of this bill revises the definition of “operator” to specifically
17 include a person responsible for the operation of a retail pet store. Section 4 of this
18 bill applies certain definitions concerning the care of animals to the provisions of
19 section 2. Sections 5, 7 and 10-17 of this bill make conforming changes to remove

– 2 –
20 references to retailers from certain provisions governing requirements for entities
21 who sell dogs or cats. Section 9 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 2
22 do not apply to certain activities.
23 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that a person who sells or
24 attempts to sell, offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a live animal at a
25 swap meet is guilty of a misdemeanor. Existing law, as an exception to such a
26 prohibition, authorizes a person to perform such acts at a swap meet if it is
27 conducted in a county or incorporated city in this State that has authorized, by an
28 ordinance which meets certain requirements, such a sale and the person performs
29 such acts in accordance with the ordinance. (NRS 574.550) Section 18 of this bill
30 instead prohibits a person from selling, attempting to sell or offering for adoption or
31 transferring ownership of a dog or cat at a swap meet, without exception.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 574 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. A retail pet store shall not sell, offer to sell,
4 barter, auction or otherwise transfer ownership of any dog or cat.
5 2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a
6 retail pet store from collaborating with an animal shelter or
7 animal rescue organization for the purpose of adoption to provide
8 space to showcase dogs or cats under the care of the animal
9 shelter or animal rescue organization. A retail pet store that
10 provides space to an animal shelter or animal rescue organization
11 in such a manner must not receive any compensation for
12 showcasing the dog or cat or any portion of the fees that result
13 from the adoption of the dog or cat.
14 3. An operator of a retail pet store that violates the provisions
15 of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
16 4. For the purposes of prosecuting a violation of this section,
17 each act that constitutes a violation of this section is a separate
18 offense. In addition to any other penalty that may be imposed, the
19 court may prohibit a person who is guilty of a misdemeanor
20 pursuant to subsection 3 from selling any dogs or cats that he or
21 she is otherwise authorized to sell as a breeder or dealer, if
22 applicable, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for not more
23 than 1 year.
24 5. As used in this section, “animal rescue organization” has
25 the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 574.205. The term does not
26 include a dealer, a breeder or any organization that is located on
