Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law sets forth certain requirements for retailers and dealers who sell dogs or
2 cats. (NRS 574.450-574.510) Section 8 of this bill revises the term “retailer” to “retail pet
3 store” and revises the definition for purposes of such requirements to mean a commercial
4 establishment in the business of acquiring animals for resale that sells or offers to sell such
5 animals to consumers on the premises of the business. Section 6 of this bill provides that the
6 definition of “dealer” does not include a “retail pet store.”
7 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a retail pet store from selling, offering to sell, bartering,
8 auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any dog or cat. Section 2 further: (1)
9 provides that an operator of a retail pet store that violates this prohibition is guilty of a
10 misdemeanor; and (2) authorizes the court to prohibit such a person from selling any dogs or
11 cats that he or she is otherwise authorized to sell as a breeder or dealer for not more than 1
12 year. Finally, section 2 provides that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of section 2, each
13 act that constitutes a violation is a separate offense.
14 Section 7.5 of this bill revises the definition of “operator” to specifically include a person
15 responsible for the operation of a retail pet store. Section 4 of this bill applies certain
16 definitions concerning the care of animals to the provisions of section 2. Sections 5, 7 and 10-
17 17 of this bill make conforming changes to remove

18 references to retailers from certain provisions governing requirements for entities who sell
19 dogs or cats. Section 9 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 2 do not apply to
20 certain activities.
21 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that a person who sells or attempts to sell,
22 offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a live animal at a swap meet is guilty of a
23 misdemeanor. Existing law, as an exception to such a prohibition, authorizes a person to
24 perform such acts at a swap meet if it is conducted in a county or incorporated city in this
25 State that has authorized, by an ordinance which meets certain requirements, such a sale and
26 the person performs such acts in accordance with the ordinance. (NRS 574.550) Section 18 of
27 this bill instead prohibits a person from selling, attempting to sell or offering for adoption or
28 transferring ownership of a dog or cat at a swap meet, without exception.]
29 Existing law creates the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources.
30 (NRS 218E.320) Existing law authorizes the Committee to: (1) evaluate and review issues
31 related to natural resources in this State; (2) conduct investigations and hold hearings;
32 and (3) conduct studies as directed by the Legislature or Legislative Commission.
33 Existing law requires the Committee to make certain reports to the Legislature. (NRS
34 218E.330) This bill directs the Committee to conduct a study during the 2025-2026
35 interim concerning the sale of cats and dogs by retail pet stores in this State.
