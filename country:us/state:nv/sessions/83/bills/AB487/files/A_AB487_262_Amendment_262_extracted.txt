EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to animals; prohibiting a retail pet store from selling, offering to
sell, bartering, auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any
dog or cat; providing that [a person who is responsible for the
operation] an operator of a retail pet store that [knowingly] commits
such an act is guilty of a misdemeanor; [providing, with certain
exceptions, that a person who sells or attempts to sell, offers for
adoption or transfers ownership of a dog or cat in certain locations is
guilty of a misdemeanor;] revising provisions governing the sale of
dogs and cats; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for retailers and dealers who sell dogs or cats.
2 (NRS 574.450-574.510) Section 8 of this bill revises the term “retailer” to “retail pet store”
3 and revises the definition for purposes of such requirements to mean a commercial
4 establishment in the business of acquiring animals for resale that sells or [selling food,
5 supplies and other items for] offers to sell such animals to consumers on the premises of the
6 business. Section 6 of this bill provides that the definition of “dealer” does not include a
7 “retail pet store.”
8 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a retail pet store from selling, offering to sell, bartering,
9 auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any dog or cat. Section 2 further: (1)
10 provides that [a person who is responsible for the operation] an operator of a retail pet store
11 [who knowingly] that violates this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) authorizes
12 the court to prohibit such a person from selling any dogs or cats that he or she is otherwise
13 authorized to sell as a breeder or dealer for not more than 1 year. Finally, section 2 provides
14 that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of section 2, each act that constitutes a violation
15 is a separate offense.
16 Section 7.5 of this bill revises the definition of “operator” to specifically include a
17 person responsible for the operation of a retail pet store. Section 4 of this bill applies
18 certain definitions concerning the care of animals to the provisions of [sections] section 2 .
19 [and 3 of this bill.] Sections 5, 7 and 10-17 of this bill make conforming changes to remove
20 references to retailers from certain provisions governing requirements for entities who sell
Assembly Amendment No. 262 to Assembly Bill No. 487 Page 4
21 dogs or cats. Section 9 of this bill provides that the provisions of [sections] section 2 [and 3]
22 do not apply to certain activities.
23 [Section 3 provides that, with certain exceptions, a person who sells or attempts to sell,
24 offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a dog or cat on any street, road or public place is
25 guilty of a misdemeanor.]
26 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that a person who sells or attempts to sell,
27 offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a live animal at a swap meet is guilty of a
28 misdemeanor. Existing law, as an exception to such a prohibition, authorizes a person to
29 perform such acts at a swap meet if it is conducted in a county or incorporated city in this
30 State that has authorized, by an ordinance which meets certain requirements, such a sale and
31 the person performs such acts in accordance with the ordinance. (NRS 574.550) Section 18 of
32 this bill instead prohibits a person from selling, attempting to sell or offering for adoption or
33 transferring ownership of a dog or cat at a swap meet, without exception.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to animals; prohibiting a retail pet store from selling, offering to
sell, bartering, auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any
dog or cat; providing that [a person who is responsible for the
operation] an operator of a retail pet store that [knowingly] commits
such an act is guilty of a misdemeanor; [providing, with certain
exceptions, that a person who sells or attempts to sell, offers for
adoption or transfers ownership of a dog or cat in certain locations is
guilty of a misdemeanor;] revising provisions governing the sale of
dogs and cats; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for retailers and dealers who sell dogs or cats.
2 (NRS 574.450-574.510) Section 8 of this bill revises the term “retailer” to “retail pet store”
3 and revises the definition for purposes of such requirements to mean a commercial
4 establishment in the business of acquiring animals for resale that sells or [selling food,
5 supplies and other items for] offers to sell such animals to consumers on the premises of the
6 business. Section 6 of this bill provides that the definition of “dealer” does not include a
7 “retail pet store.”
8 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a retail pet store from selling, offering to sell, bartering,
9 auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any dog or cat. Section 2 further: (1)
10 provides that [a person who is responsible for the operation] an operator of a retail pet store
11 [who knowingly] that violates this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) authorizes
12 the court to prohibit such a person from selling any dogs or cats that he or she is otherwise
13 authorized to sell as a breeder or dealer for not more than 1 year. Finally, section 2 provides
14 that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of section 2, each act that constitutes a violation
15 is a separate offense.
16 Section 7.5 of this bill revises the definition of “operator” to specifically include a
17 person responsible for the operation of a retail pet store. Section 4 of this bill applies
18 certain definitions concerning the care of animals to the provisions of [sections] section 2 .
19 [and 3 of this bill.] Sections 5, 7 and 10-17 of this bill make conforming changes to remove
20 references to retailers from certain provisions governing requirements for entities who sell

Assembly Amendment No. 262 to Assembly Bill No. 487 Page 4
21 dogs or cats. Section 9 of this bill provides that the provisions of [sections] section 2 [and 3]
22 do not apply to certain activities.
23 [Section 3 provides that, with certain exceptions, a person who sells or attempts to sell,
24 offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a dog or cat on any street, road or public place is
25 guilty of a misdemeanor.]
26 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that a person who sells or attempts to sell,
27 offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a live animal at a swap meet is guilty of a
28 misdemeanor. Existing law, as an exception to such a prohibition, authorizes a person to
29 perform such acts at a swap meet if it is conducted in a county or incorporated city in this
30 State that has authorized, by an ordinance which meets certain requirements, such a sale and
31 the person performs such acts in accordance with the ordinance. (NRS 574.550) Section 18 of
32 this bill instead prohibits a person from selling, attempting to sell or offering for adoption or
33 transferring ownership of a dog or cat at a swap meet, without exception.
