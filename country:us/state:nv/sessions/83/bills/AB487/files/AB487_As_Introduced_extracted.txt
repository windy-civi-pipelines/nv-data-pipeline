Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for retailers and dealers who sell
2 dogs or cats. (NRS 574.450-574.510) Section 8 of this bill revises the term
3 “retailer” to “retail pet store” and revises the definition for purposes of such
4 requirements to mean a commercial establishment in the business of acquiring
5 animals for resale or selling food, supplies and other items for animals to
6 consumers on the premises of the business. Section 6 of this bill provides that the
7 definition of “dealer” does not include a “retail pet store.”
8 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a retail pet store from selling, offering to sell,
9 bartering, auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any dog or cat. Section
10 2 further: (1) provides that a person who is responsible for the operation of a retail
11 pet store who knowingly violates this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor; and
12 (2) authorizes the court to prohibit such a person from selling any dogs or cats that
13 he or she is otherwise authorized to sell as a breeder or dealer for not more than 1
14 year. Finally, section 2 provides that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of
15 section 2, each act that constitutes a violation is a separate offense. Section 4 of
-

– 2 –
16 this bill applies certain definitions concerning the care of animals to the provisions
17 of sections 2 and 3 of this bill. Sections 5, 7 and 10-17 of this bill make
18 conforming changes to remove references to retailers from certain provisions
19 governing requirements for entities who sell dogs or cats. Section 9 of this bill
20 provides that the provisions of sections 2 and 3 do not apply to certain activities.
21 Section 3 provides that, with certain exceptions, a person who sells or attempts
22 to sell, offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a dog or cat on any street, road
23 or public place is guilty of a misdemeanor.
24 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that a person who sells or
25 attempts to sell, offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a live animal at a
26 swap meet is guilty of a misdemeanor. Existing law, as an exception to such a
27 prohibition, authorizes a person to perform such acts at a swap meet if it is
28 conducted in a county or incorporated city in this State that has authorized, by an
29 ordinance which meets certain requirements, such a sale and the person performs
30 such acts in accordance with the ordinance. (NRS 574.550) Section 18 of this bill
31 instead prohibits a person from selling, attempting to sell or offering for adoption or
32 transferring ownership of a dog or cat at a swap meet, without exception.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to animals; prohibiting a retail pet store from
selling, offering to sell, bartering, auctioning or otherwise
transferring ownership of any dog or cat; providing that a
person who is responsible for the operation of a retail pet
store that knowingly commits such an act is guilty of a
misdemeanor; providing, with certain exceptions, that a
person who sells or attempts to sell, offers for adoption or
transfers ownership of a dog or cat in certain locations is
guilty of a misdemeanor; revising provisions governing
the sale of dogs and cats; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for retailers and dealers who sell
2 dogs or cats. (NRS 574.450-574.510) Section 8 of this bill revises the term
3 “retailer” to “retail pet store” and revises the definition for purposes of such
4 requirements to mean a commercial establishment in the business of acquiring
5 animals for resale or selling food, supplies and other items for animals to
6 consumers on the premises of the business. Section 6 of this bill provides that the
7 definition of “dealer” does not include a “retail pet store.”
8 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a retail pet store from selling, offering to sell,
9 bartering, auctioning or otherwise transferring ownership of any dog or cat. Section
10 2 further: (1) provides that a person who is responsible for the operation of a retail
11 pet store who knowingly violates this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor; and
12 (2) authorizes the court to prohibit such a person from selling any dogs or cats that
13 he or she is otherwise authorized to sell as a breeder or dealer for not more than 1
14 year. Finally, section 2 provides that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of
15 section 2, each act that constitutes a violation is a separate offense. Section 4 of
-

– 2 –
16 this bill applies certain definitions concerning the care of animals to the provisions
17 of sections 2 and 3 of this bill. Sections 5, 7 and 10-17 of this bill make
18 conforming changes to remove references to retailers from certain provisions
19 governing requirements for entities who sell dogs or cats. Section 9 of this bill
20 provides that the provisions of sections 2 and 3 do not apply to certain activities.
21 Section 3 provides that, with certain exceptions, a person who sells or attempts
22 to sell, offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a dog or cat on any street, road
23 or public place is guilty of a misdemeanor.
24 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that a person who sells or
25 attempts to sell, offers for adoption or transfers ownership of a live animal at a
26 swap meet is guilty of a misdemeanor. Existing law, as an exception to such a
27 prohibition, authorizes a person to perform such acts at a swap meet if it is
28 conducted in a county or incorporated city in this State that has authorized, by an
29 ordinance which meets certain requirements, such a sale and the person performs
30 such acts in accordance with the ordinance. (NRS 574.550) Section 18 of this bill
31 instead prohibits a person from selling, attempting to sell or offering for adoption or
32 transferring ownership of a dog or cat at a swap meet, without exception.
