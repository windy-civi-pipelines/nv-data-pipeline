Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is
2 current and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g.,
3 NRS 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842,
4 293.5847, 293C.26314) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “current and valid”
5 for such purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to
6 certain provisions relating to elections.
7 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
8 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
9 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
10 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
11 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
12 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
13 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
14 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
15 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
16 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
17 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
18 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
19 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
20 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
21 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
22 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card; (2) revises the description
23 of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
24 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
25 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
26 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
27 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
28 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
29 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
30 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
31 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
32 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
33 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
34 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
35 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
36 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
37 election. (NRS 298.670)
38 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
39 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
40 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
41 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
42 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
-
*SB74_R2*
– 3 –
43 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
44 application to preregister or register to vote.
45 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training
46 course to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and
47 requires the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as
48 applicable, for the cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county
49 clerk or city clerk for attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the
50 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such
51 costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city clerk who
52 attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
53 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary
54 of State and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section
55 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain
56 other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the training course.
57 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
58 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
59 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
60 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.
61 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
62 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
63 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
64 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
65 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
66 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
67 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
68 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
69 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
70 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
71 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
72 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
73 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
74 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
75 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
76 select “None of these candidates.”
77 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
78 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
79 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
80 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
81 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
82 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
83 polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7 a.m. on the
84 day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
85 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper
86 ballots.
87 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
88 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
89 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
90 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
91 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a vote must be counted if: (1) a portion
92 of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking
93 cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there is some
94 indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
95 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
96 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
97 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
-
*SB74_R2*
– 4 –
98 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
99 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
100 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
101 accuracy audit.
102 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
103 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
104 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
105 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
106 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
107 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
108 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
109 automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to vote after
110 this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
111 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
112 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or
113 an elector at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party
114 affiliation or that he or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or
115 elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a political party or fails to
116 indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s or elector’s
117 political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
118 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
119 political party as “no political party.”
120 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for
121 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this
122 bill requires an application to preregister or register to vote to include an option for
123 a voter to elect not to receive a mail ballot.
124 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
125 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
126 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
127 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
128 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
129 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
130 Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and conduct
131 any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
132 law.
133 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
134 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
135 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
136 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
137 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
138 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
139 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
140 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
141 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
142 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
143 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
144 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
145 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
146 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
147 for the election.
148 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from performing
149 certain election-related actions in certain locations, including within 100 feet from
150 the entrance to a building or other structure in which a polling place is located.
151 (NRS 293.740) Section 24.3 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100
152 feet of the entrance to a voting area.
-
*SB74_R2*
– 5 –
153 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same
154 election. (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a
155 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a
156 time. (NRS 293.810) Section 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more
157 than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more than once in certain
158 elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or general election in this State
159 and at least one other state.
160 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
161 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
162 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
163 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
164 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
165 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
166 official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the Legislative
167 Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of an
168 information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in
169 accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
170 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
171 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
172 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
173 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
174 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person
175 to request that such information be kept confidential.
176 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
177 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24
178 hours after the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24
179 hours after the official count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of
180 the final ballot.
181 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
182 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
183 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
184 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
185 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
186 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.
187 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
188 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
189 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
190 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
191 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
192 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
193 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
194 election to recall a public officer.
195 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
196 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
197 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
198 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
199 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
200 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
201 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
202 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
203 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
204 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
205 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
206 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
-
*SB74_R2*
– 6 –
207 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
208 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
209 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
210 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a
211 recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the
212 number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation to the
213 Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that
214 deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter registration to
215 retain their prior residence.

20 which must be written the reason for their rejection. The envelope
21 must be signed by the counting board officers and placed in the
22 container or ballot box after the count is completed.
23 (b) If the ballots in the container or box are found to exceed in

26 counting board officer, with his or her back turned to the container
27 or box, shall draw out a number of ballots equal to the excess. The

31 with the other ballots rejected for any cause.

33 agrees with the number of names of registered voters shown to have
34 voted, the board shall proceed to count. If there is a discrepancy

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is
2 current and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g.,
3 NRS 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842,
4 293.5847, 293C.26314) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “current and valid”
5 for such purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to
6 certain provisions relating to elections.
7 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
8 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
9 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
10 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
11 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
12 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
13 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
14 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
15 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
16 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
17 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
18 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
19 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
20 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
21 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
22 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card; (2) revises the description
23 of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
24 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
25 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
26 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
27 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
28 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
29 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
30 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
31 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
32 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
33 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
34 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
35 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
36 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
37 election. (NRS 298.670)
38 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
39 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
40 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
41 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
42 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
-
*SB74_R2*

– 3 –
43 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
44 application to preregister or register to vote.
45 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training
46 course to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and
47 requires the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as
48 applicable, for the cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county
49 clerk or city clerk for attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the
50 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such
51 costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city clerk who
52 attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
53 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary
54 of State and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section
55 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain
56 other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the training course.
57 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
58 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
59 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
60 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.
61 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
62 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
63 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
64 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
65 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
66 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
67 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
68 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
69 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
70 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
71 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
72 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
73 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
74 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
75 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
76 select “None of these candidates.”
77 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
78 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
79 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
80 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
81 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
82 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
83 polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7 a.m. on the
84 day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
85 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper
86 ballots.
87 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
88 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
89 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
90 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
91 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a vote must be counted if: (1) a portion
92 of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking
93 cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there is some
94 indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
95 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
96 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
97 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
-
*SB74_R2*

– 4 –
98 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
99 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
100 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
101 accuracy audit.
102 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
103 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
104 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
105 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
106 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
107 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
108 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
109 automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to vote after
110 this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
111 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
112 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or
113 an elector at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party
114 affiliation or that he or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or
115 elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a political party or fails to
116 indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s or elector’s
117 political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
118 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
119 political party as “no political party.”
120 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for
121 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this
122 bill requires an application to preregister or register to vote to include an option for
123 a voter to elect not to receive a mail ballot.
124 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
125 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
126 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
127 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
128 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
129 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
130 Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and conduct
131 any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
132 law.
133 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
134 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
135 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
136 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
137 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
138 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
139 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
140 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
141 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
142 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
143 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
144 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
145 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
146 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
147 for the election.
148 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from performing
149 certain election-related actions in certain locations, including within 100 feet from
150 the entrance to a building or other structure in which a polling place is located.
151 (NRS 293.740) Section 24.3 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100
152 feet of the entrance to a voting area.
-
*SB74_R2*

– 5 –
153 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same
154 election. (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a
155 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a
156 time. (NRS 293.810) Section 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more
157 than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more than once in certain
158 elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or general election in this State
159 and at least one other state.
160 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
161 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
162 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
163 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
164 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
165 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
166 official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the Legislative
167 Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of an
168 information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in
169 accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
170 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
171 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
172 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
173 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
174 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person
175 to request that such information be kept confidential.
176 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
177 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24
178 hours after the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24
179 hours after the official count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of
180 the final ballot.
181 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
182 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
183 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
184 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
185 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
186 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.
187 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
188 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
189 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
190 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
191 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
192 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
193 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
194 election to recall a public officer.
195 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
196 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
197 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
198 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
199 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
200 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
201 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
202 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
203 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
204 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
205 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
206 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
-
*SB74_R2*

– 6 –
207 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
208 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
209 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
210 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a
211 recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the
212 number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation to the
213 Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that
214 deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter registration to
215 retain their prior residence.
