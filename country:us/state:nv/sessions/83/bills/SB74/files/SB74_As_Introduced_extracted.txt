Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved
2 electronic transmission through which: (1) certain military and overseas electors
3 and voters; (2) certain electors and registered voters with a disability; or (3) certain
4 electors and registered voters who are tribal members may register to vote, request
5 a ballot and cast a ballot. (NRS 293.269951, 293D.200) Sections 1 and 28 of this
6 bill require the Secretary of State to allow any registered voter to use the system of
7 approved electronic transmission to apply for and cast a ballot if the registered
8 voter: (1) does not have access to his or her mail ballot; and (2) is unable to go to
9 the polls because of an illness or disability resulting in confinement, hospitalization,
10 serious illness or is suddenly called away from home. Sections 16 and 35 of this
11 bill authorize the county and city clerks to notify the public of the provisions of
12 sections 1 and 28.
13 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
14 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
15 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
16 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
17 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
18 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
19 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
20 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
21 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
22 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
23 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
24 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
25 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
26 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
27 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
28 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card; (2) revises the description
29 of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
30 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
31 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
32 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
33 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
34 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
35 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
36 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
37 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
38 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
39 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
40 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
41 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
42 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
43 election. (NRS 298.670)
44 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
45 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
46 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
47 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
48 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
49 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
50 application to preregister or register to vote.
51 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
52 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
53 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
54 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.

55 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
56 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
57 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
58 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
59 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
60 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
61 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
62 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
63 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
64 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
65 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
66 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
67 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
68 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
69 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
70 select “None of these candidates.”
71 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
72 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
73 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
74 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
75 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
76 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
77 polls are closed; and (2) remove requirements for counting paper ballots.
78 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
79 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
80 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
81 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
82 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State to establish uniform
83 thresholds for determining whether writing or a mark must be counted as a vote.
84 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
85 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
86 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
87 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
88 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
89 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
90 accuracy audit.
91 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
92 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
93 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
94 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
95 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
96 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
97 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
98 automatic voter registration agency to notify a voter who registers to vote after this
99 deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the voter must register to
100 vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
101 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or
102 an elector at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party
103 affiliation or that he or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or
104 elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a political party or fails to
105 indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s or elector’s
106 political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
107 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
108 political party as “no political party.”

109 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for
110 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this
111 bill requires an application to preregister or register to vote to include an option for
112 a voter to elect not to receive a mail ballot. Sections 11 and 32 of this bill make
113 conforming changes to provide that a county clerk and city clerk shall not distribute
114 a mail ballot to a person who has elected not to receive a mail ballot.
115 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
116 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
117 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
118 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
119 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
120 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
121 Sections 20, 21 and 25 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and
122 conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing
123 federal law.
124 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
125 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
126 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
127 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
128 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
129 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
130 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
131 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
132 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
133 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
134 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
135 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
136 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
137 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
138 for the election.
139 Existing law prohibits a person from being preregistered or registered to vote in
140 more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section 25 instead prohibits a
141 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one state at a
142 time.
143 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
144 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
145 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
146 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
147 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
148 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
149 official to notify the Secretary of State of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-
150 incident on the security of an information system used by the county or city clerk or
151 other election official in accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
152 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
153 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
154 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
155 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
156 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly dependent of such a
157 person to request that such information be kept confidential.
158 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
159 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
160 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
161 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
162 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
163 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.

164 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
165 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
166 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
167 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
168 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
169 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
170 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
171 election to recall a public officer.
172 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
173 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
174 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
175 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
176 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
177 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
178 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
179 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
180 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
181 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
182 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
183 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
184 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
185 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
186 Section 48 of this bill repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting
187 board from commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2)
188 provide for a recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to
189 transmit the number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation
190 to the Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a
191 provision that deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter
192 registration to retain their prior residence.

42 voted, the board shall proceed to count. If there is a discrepancy
43 between the number of ballots and the number of voters, a record of
44 the discrepancy must be made.]

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved
2 electronic transmission through which: (1) certain military and overseas electors
3 and voters; (2) certain electors and registered voters with a disability; or (3) certain
4 electors and registered voters who are tribal members may register to vote, request
5 a ballot and cast a ballot. (NRS 293.269951, 293D.200) Sections 1 and 28 of this
6 bill require the Secretary of State to allow any registered voter to use the system of
7 approved electronic transmission to apply for and cast a ballot if the registered
8 voter: (1) does not have access to his or her mail ballot; and (2) is unable to go to
9 the polls because of an illness or disability resulting in confinement, hospitalization,
10 serious illness or is suddenly called away from home. Sections 16 and 35 of this
11 bill authorize the county and city clerks to notify the public of the provisions of
12 sections 1 and 28.
13 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
14 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
15 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
16 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
17 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
18 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
19 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
20 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
21 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
22 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
23 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
24 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
25 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
26 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
27 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
28 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card; (2) revises the description
29 of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
30 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
31 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
32 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
33 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
34 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
35 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
36 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
37 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
38 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
39 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
40 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
41 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
42 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
43 election. (NRS 298.670)
44 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
45 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
46 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
47 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
48 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
49 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
50 application to preregister or register to vote.
51 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
52 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
53 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
54 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.

55 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
56 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
57 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
58 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
59 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
60 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
61 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
62 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
63 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
64 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
65 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
66 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
67 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
68 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
69 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
70 select “None of these candidates.”
71 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
72 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
73 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
74 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
75 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
76 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
77 polls are closed; and (2) remove requirements for counting paper ballots.
78 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
79 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
80 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
81 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
82 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State to establish uniform
83 thresholds for determining whether writing or a mark must be counted as a vote.
84 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
85 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
86 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
87 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
88 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
89 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
90 accuracy audit.
91 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
92 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
93 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
94 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
95 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
96 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
97 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
98 automatic voter registration agency to notify a voter who registers to vote after this
99 deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the voter must register to
100 vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
101 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or
102 an elector at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party
103 affiliation or that he or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or
104 elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a political party or fails to
105 indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s or elector’s
106 political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
107 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
108 political party as “no political party.”

109 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for
110 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this
111 bill requires an application to preregister or register to vote to include an option for
112 a voter to elect not to receive a mail ballot. Sections 11 and 32 of this bill make
113 conforming changes to provide that a county clerk and city clerk shall not distribute
114 a mail ballot to a person who has elected not to receive a mail ballot.
115 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
116 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
117 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
118 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
119 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
120 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
121 Sections 20, 21 and 25 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and
122 conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing
123 federal law.
124 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
125 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
126 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
127 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
128 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
129 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
130 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
131 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
132 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
133 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
134 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
135 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
136 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
137 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
138 for the election.
139 Existing law prohibits a person from being preregistered or registered to vote in
140 more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section 25 instead prohibits a
141 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one state at a
142 time.
143 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
144 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
145 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
146 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
147 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
148 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
149 official to notify the Secretary of State of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-
150 incident on the security of an information system used by the county or city clerk or
151 other election official in accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
152 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
153 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
154 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
155 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
156 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly dependent of such a
157 person to request that such information be kept confidential.
158 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
159 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
160 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
161 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
162 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
163 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.

164 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
165 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
166 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
167 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
168 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
169 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
170 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
171 election to recall a public officer.
172 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
173 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
174 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
175 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
176 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
177 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
178 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
179 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
180 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
181 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
182 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
183 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
184 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
185 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
186 Section 48 of this bill repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting
187 board from commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2)
188 provide for a recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to
189 transmit the number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation
190 to the Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a
191 provision that deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter
192 registration to retain their prior residence.

28 a valid choice for one or more candidates for that office
29 shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election
30 for that office.
