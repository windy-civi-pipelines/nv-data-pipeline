Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is current and
2 valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g., NRS 293.269915,
3 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842, 293.5847, 293C.26314)
4 Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “current and valid” for such purposes and section 1.7
5 of this bill makes that definition applicable to certain provisions relating to elections.
6 [Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved electronic
7 transmission through which: (1) certain military and overseas electors and voters; (2) certain
8 electors and registered voters with a disability; or (3) certain electors and registered voters
9 who are tribal members may register to vote, request a ballot and cast a ballot. (NRS
10 293.269951, 293D.200) Sections 1.5 and 28 of this bill require the Secretary of State to allow
11 any registered voter to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply for and
12 cast a ballot if the registered voter: (1) does not have access to his or her mail ballot; or (2) is
13 unable to go to the polls because of an illness or disability resulting in confinement,
14 hospitalization, serious illness or is suddenly called away from home. Sections 16 and 35 of
15 this bill authorize the county and city clerks to notify the public of the provisions of sections
16 1.5 and 28, respectively.]
17 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a major
18 political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain information on an
19 application to register to vote in a state other than this State during the time beginning on
20 December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an election and ending on the date of the
21 election. (NRS 293.176)
22 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a declaration of
23 candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form for a declaration of
24 candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177) Section 3 of this bill sets forth
25 the form for the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan office.
26 Section 5 of this bill makes conforming changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy
27 for an independent candidate must be in the form set forth in section 3.
28 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and provides that
29 the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash, cashier’s check or certified
30 check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1) provides that such a fee may also be paid by
31 credit card; (2) revises the description of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set
32 forth in other provisions of existing law in to this schedule of fees.
33 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified list of
34 candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary election or
35 general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once a week for 2
36 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of the election; (2) the
37 location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which the polling places will be open
38 for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill requires such notice to additionally contain:
39 (1) the names of the candidates; and (2) the office for which each candidate is running and, if
40 the office is partisan, the party under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill
41 similarly requires the names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the
42 presidential preference primary election and the major political party with which each
43 candidate is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
44 election. (NRS 298.670)
45 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the position of
46 election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an appointment, including a
47 requirement that the pupil is appointed without party affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222)
48 Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of
49 his or her affiliation with a political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the
50 pupil’s application to preregister or register to vote.
51 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training course to
52 each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and requires the Secretary of
53 State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, for the cost of the per diem
54 allowance and travel expenses of the county clerk or city clerk for attending such a course.
55 Existing law further authorizes the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or

Senate Amendment No. 785 to Senate Bill No. 74 First Reprint Page 5
56 city, as applicable, such costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city
57 clerk who attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
58 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary of State
59 and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section 8.5 of this bill instead
60 requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain other costs for a county or city
61 clerk relating to the training course.
62 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as such from the
63 day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of the election has expired.
64 (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that members continue to serve as such
65 from the day of appointment.
66 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a majority
67 of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the candidate must be
68 declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on the ballot. (NRS 293.260,
69 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City
70 Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter § 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections
71 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide that for the purposes of determining the majority of the
72 votes cast in the primary election for an office for which voters may select more than one
73 candidate, each ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates
74 for that office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
75 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of candidates for
76 any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United States must contain an
77 additional line with a square in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.” (NRS
78 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead that the additional line on such a ballot must
79 contain a space in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.”
80 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin counting mail
81 ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the counting board to prepare to
82 count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3) establishes certain requirements for
83 counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931, 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and
84 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail
85 ballots before the polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7
86 a.m. on the day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
87 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper ballots.
88 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the Secretary
89 of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for counting a vote; and
90 (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing additional uniform
91 statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a
92 vote must be counted if: (1) a portion of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the
93 voter; (2) such a marking cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there
94 is some indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
95 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
96 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
97 audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials, including the voted, rejected and
98 spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391)
99 Section 14 of this bill provides that such election materials are subject to inspection for the
100 purposes of an election accuracy audit.
101 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration agency,
102 the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration agency is the last day to
103 register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county clerk to accept any application which
104 is completed by the last day to register to vote by mail if the county clerk receives the
105 application not later than 5 days after that date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688)
106 Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill require a voter registration agency, the Department of
107 Motor Vehicles and an automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to
108 vote after this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
109 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
110 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or an elector
111 at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party affiliation or that he
112 or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not
113 affiliated with a political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to
114 list the person’s or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this

Senate Amendment No. 785 to Senate Bill No. 74 First Reprint Page 6
115 bill instead requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
116 political party as “no political party.”
117 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for applications to
118 preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this bill requires an application
119 to preregister or register to vote to include an option for a voter to elect not to receive a mail
120 ballot.
121 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter from the
122 official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the name of a registered
123 voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction
124 in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice sent to his or her residence and has not voted or
125 appeared to vote for a period of time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52
126 U.S.C. § 20507) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and
127 conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
128 law.
129 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration information
130 after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the county or city clerk to
131 authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration information by the use of a paper
132 application or the computer system established by the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832)
133 Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county or city clerk to also authorize an additional
134 method for updating such voter registration information at a polling place during early voting
135 by personal appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
136 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or more days
137 before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates information less than 14 days
138 before the election may vote only in person in that election only at a polling place. Finally,
139 section 24 clarifies that all other provisions of law relating to voting in person or by mail still
140 apply to a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration information after the close
141 of voter registration for the election.
142 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from performing certain
143 election-related actions in certain locations, including within 100 feet from the entrance to a
144 building or other structure in which a polling place is located. (NRS 293.740) Section 24.3 of
145 this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100 feet of the entrance to a voting area.
146 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same election. (NRS
147 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a person from being
148 preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section
149 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more than once at the same election if he or she
150 votes: (1) more than once in certain elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or
151 general election in this State and at least one other state.
152 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to immediately
153 notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is informed of a confirmed
154 attack or attempted attack on the security of an information system used by the clerk or
155 official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by
156 regulation a cyber-incident response plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or
157 city clerk or other election official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the
158 Legislative Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of
159 an information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in accordance
160 with the cyber-incident response plan.
161 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or minor
162 child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the records of the
163 Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a county assessor be kept
164 confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 27, 40 and 41 of this bill
165 additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person to request that such information be
166 kept confidential.
167 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
168 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24 hours after
169 the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24 hours after the official
170 count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of the final ballot.
171 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for a
172 candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing for
173 candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days after the last day

Senate Amendment No. 785 to Senate Bill No. 74 First Reprint Page 7
174 for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill requires a withdrawal of candidacy
175 by a candidate for a city office to be presented within 7 days, consistent with the requirement
176 for all other candidates.
177 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any contributions
178 to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that no contribution made,
179 committed or accepted for a primary election or general election affects the limitation on
180 contributions for a special election to recall a public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of
181 this bill also provides that no contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election
182 other than a special election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for
183 a special election to recall a public officer.
184 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of presidential
185 electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United States not later than 6 days
186 before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, which is the first Tuesday after the
187 second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§ 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the
188 Secretary of State to transmit the certificate of ascertainment to the Archivist.
189 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major political party’s
190 nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on the ballot for a presidential
191 preference primary election to file with the Secretary of State a declaration of candidacy in the
192 form prescribed by the Secretary of State. (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the
193 form for the declaration of candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who
194 knowingly and willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
195 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
196 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
197 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a recount at
198 a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the number of registered
199 voters in the county and their political affiliation to the Secretary of State before certain
200 elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that deems certain registered voters who move
201 after the close of voter registration to retain their prior residence.

3 where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in accordance
4 with NRS 281.050, if one has been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not
5 be accepted for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following provisions

18 stating that the candidate is unable to present to the filing officer the proof of
19 residency required by subsection 3 because a street address has not been assigned to
20 the candidate’s residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
21 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency required by
22 subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing officer:
23 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a governmental
24 agency that contains a photograph of the candidate; and
25 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that the filing
26 officer determines is sufficient to verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to
27 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State

31 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency
32 provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or 4. Such a copy:

40 candidate in the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at that

42 filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The filing officer shall immediately
43 send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies to the candidate at the
44 specified address, unless the candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer
45 a different address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail the
46 copy to the last address so designated.
47 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that a candidate
48 has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her civil rights restored, the
49 filing officer:
50 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the candidate has been
51 convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the candidate has had his or her civil rights
52 restored; and

1 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from such
2 investigation to the Attorney General, if the filing officer is the Secretary of State,
3 or to the district attorney, if the filing officer is a person other than the Secretary of

6 pursuant to subsection 7 must be treated as a challenge of a candidate pursuant to
7 subsections 4 and 5 of NRS 293.182 to which the provisions of NRS 293.2045
8 apply.
9 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration of candidacy
10 which contains a false statement in violation of this section is guilty of a gross
11 misdemeanor.
