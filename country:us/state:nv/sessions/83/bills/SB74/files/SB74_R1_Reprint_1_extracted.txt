Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is
2 current and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g.,
3 NRS 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842,
4 293.5847, 293C.26314) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “current and valid”
5 for such purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to
6 certain provisions relating to elections.
7 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved
8 electronic transmission through which: (1) certain military and overseas electors
9 and voters; (2) certain electors and registered voters with a disability; or (3) certain
10 electors and registered voters who are tribal members may register to vote, request
11 a ballot and cast a ballot. (NRS 293.269951, 293D.200) Sections 1.5 and 28 of this
12 bill require the Secretary of State to allow any registered voter to use the system of
13 approved electronic transmission to apply for and cast a ballot if the registered
14 voter: (1) does not have access to his or her mail ballot; or (2) is unable to go to the
15 polls because of an illness or disability resulting in confinement, hospitalization,
16 serious illness or is suddenly called away from home. Sections 16 and 35 of this
17 bill authorize the county and city clerks to notify the public of the provisions of
18 sections 1.5 and 28, respectively.
19 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
20 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
21 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
22 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
23 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
24 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
25 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
26 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
27 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
28 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
29 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
30 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
31 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
32 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
33 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
34 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card; (2) revises the description
35 of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
36 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
37 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
38 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
39 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
40 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
41 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
-
*SB74_R1*
– 3 –
42 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
43 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
44 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
45 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
46 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
47 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
48 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
49 election. (NRS 298.670)
50 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
51 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
52 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
53 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
54 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
55 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
56 application to preregister or register to vote.
57 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training
58 course to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and
59 requires the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as
60 applicable, for the cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county
61 clerk or city clerk for attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the
62 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such
63 costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city clerk who
64 attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
65 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary
66 of State and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section
67 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain
68 other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the training course.
69 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
70 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
71 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
72 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.
73 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
74 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
75 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
76 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
77 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
78 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
79 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
80 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
81 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
82 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
83 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
84 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
85 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
86 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
87 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
88 select “None of these candidates.”
89 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
90 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
91 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
92 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
93 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
94 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
95 polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7 a.m. on the
96 day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
-
*SB74_R1*
– 4 –
97 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper
98 ballots.
99 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
100 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
101 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
102 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
103 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a vote must be counted if: (1) a portion
104 of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking
105 cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there is some
106 indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
107 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
108 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
109 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
110 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
111 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
112 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
113 accuracy audit.
114 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
115 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
116 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
117 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
118 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
119 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
120 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
121 automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to vote after
122 this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
123 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
124 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or
125 an elector at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party
126 affiliation or that he or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or
127 elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a political party or fails to
128 indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s or elector’s
129 political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
130 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
131 political party as “no political party.”
132 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for
133 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this
134 bill requires an application to preregister or register to vote to include an option for
135 a voter to elect not to receive a mail ballot.
136 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
137 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
138 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
139 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
140 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
141 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
142 Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and conduct
143 any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
144 law.
145 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
146 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
147 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
148 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
149 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
150 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
151 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
-
*SB74_R1*
– 5 –
152 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
153 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
154 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
155 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
156 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
157 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
158 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
159 for the election.
160 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from performing
161 certain election-related actions in certain locations, including within 100 feet from
162 the entrance to a building or other structure in which a polling place is located.
163 (NRS 293.740) Section 24.3 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100
164 feet of the entrance to a voting area.
165 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same
166 election. (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a
167 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a
168 time. (NRS 293.810) Section 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more
169 than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more than once in certain
170 elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or general election in this State
171 and at least one other state.
172 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
173 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
174 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
175 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
176 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
177 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
178 official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the Legislative
179 Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of an
180 information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in
181 accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
182 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
183 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
184 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
185 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
186 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person
187 to request that such information be kept confidential.
188 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
189 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24
190 hours after the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24
191 hours after the official count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of
192 the final ballot.
193 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
194 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
195 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
196 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
197 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
198 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.
199 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
200 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
201 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
202 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
203 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
204 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
205 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
206 election to recall a public officer.

207 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
208 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
209 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
210 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
211 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
212 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
213 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
214 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
215 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
216 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
217 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
218 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
219 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
220 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
221 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
222 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a
223 recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the
224 number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation to the
225 Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that
226 deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter registration to
227 retain their prior residence.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is
2 current and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g.,
3 NRS 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842,
4 293.5847, 293C.26314) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “current and valid”
5 for such purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to
6 certain provisions relating to elections.
7 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved
8 electronic transmission through which: (1) certain military and overseas electors
9 and voters; (2) certain electors and registered voters with a disability; or (3) certain
10 electors and registered voters who are tribal members may register to vote, request
11 a ballot and cast a ballot. (NRS 293.269951, 293D.200) Sections 1.5 and 28 of this
12 bill require the Secretary of State to allow any registered voter to use the system of
13 approved electronic transmission to apply for and cast a ballot if the registered
14 voter: (1) does not have access to his or her mail ballot; or (2) is unable to go to the
15 polls because of an illness or disability resulting in confinement, hospitalization,
16 serious illness or is suddenly called away from home. Sections 16 and 35 of this
17 bill authorize the county and city clerks to notify the public of the provisions of
18 sections 1.5 and 28, respectively.
19 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
20 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
21 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
22 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
23 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
24 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
25 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
26 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
27 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
28 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
29 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
30 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
31 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
32 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
33 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
34 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card; (2) revises the description
35 of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
36 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
37 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
38 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
39 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
40 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
41 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
-
*SB74_R1*

– 3 –
42 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
43 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
44 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
45 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
46 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
47 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
48 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
49 election. (NRS 298.670)
50 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
51 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
52 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
53 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
54 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
55 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
56 application to preregister or register to vote.
57 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training
58 course to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and
59 requires the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as
60 applicable, for the cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county
61 clerk or city clerk for attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the
62 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such
63 costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city clerk who
64 attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
65 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary
66 of State and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section
67 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain
68 other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the training course.
69 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
70 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
71 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
72 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.
73 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
74 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
75 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
76 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
77 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
78 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
79 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
80 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
81 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
82 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
83 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
84 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
85 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
86 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
87 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
88 select “None of these candidates.”
89 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
90 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
91 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
92 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
93 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
94 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
95 polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7 a.m. on the
96 day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
-
*SB74_R1*

– 4 –
97 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper
98 ballots.
99 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
100 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
101 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
102 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
103 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a vote must be counted if: (1) a portion
104 of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking
105 cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there is some
106 indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
107 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
108 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
109 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
110 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
111 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
112 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
113 accuracy audit.
114 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
115 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
116 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
117 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
118 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
119 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
120 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
121 automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to vote after
122 this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
123 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
124 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or
125 an elector at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party
126 affiliation or that he or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or
127 elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a political party or fails to
128 indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s or elector’s
129 political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
130 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
131 political party as “no political party.”
132 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for
133 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this
134 bill requires an application to preregister or register to vote to include an option for
135 a voter to elect not to receive a mail ballot.
136 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
137 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
138 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
139 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
140 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
141 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
142 Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and conduct
143 any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
144 law.
145 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
146 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
147 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
148 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
149 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
150 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
151 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
-
*SB74_R1*

– 5 –
152 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
153 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
154 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
155 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
156 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
157 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
158 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
159 for the election.
160 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from performing
161 certain election-related actions in certain locations, including within 100 feet from
162 the entrance to a building or other structure in which a polling place is located.
163 (NRS 293.740) Section 24.3 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100
164 feet of the entrance to a voting area.
165 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same
166 election. (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a
167 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a
168 time. (NRS 293.810) Section 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more
169 than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more than once in certain
170 elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or general election in this State
171 and at least one other state.
172 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
173 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
174 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
175 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
176 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
177 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
178 official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the Legislative

185 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections

25 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
