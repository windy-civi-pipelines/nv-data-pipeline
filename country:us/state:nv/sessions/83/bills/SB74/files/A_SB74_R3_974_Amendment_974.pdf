Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is current and
2 valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g., NRS 293.269915,
3 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842, 293.5847, 293C.26314)
4 Section 1.4 of this bill defines the term “current and valid” for such purposes and section 1.7
5 of this bill makes that definition applicable to certain provisions relating to elections.
6 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the preparation, distribution and casting of
7 mail ballots and requires a county or city clerk, as applicable, to prepare and distribute to each
8 active registered voter in the county or city and certain other persons who register to vote a
9 mail ballot for every election. (NRS 293.269911-293.269937, 293C.263-293C.26337)
10 Sections 1.6, 11.3, 28.3 and 32.3 of this bill authorize an active registered voter who is
11 eligible to receive a mail ballot to submit a request to the county or city clerk, as applicable, to
12 receive a mail ballot if he or she is unable to access his or her mail ballot or appear in person
13 at the polls due to an emergency. Sections 1.6 and 28.3 further require a county or city clerk
14 to distribute a mail ballot to such a voter after verifying the voter’s eligibility and that he or
15 she has not already voted. Sections 1.9, 11.5, 28.7 and 32.7 of this bill make certain
16 provisions relating to mail ballots, including the definition of “mail ballot” and provisions
17 concerning the marking and signing the mail ballot of another voter, applicable to ballots
18 requested pursuant to sections 1.6 and 28.3.
19 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a major
20 political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain information on an
21 application to register to vote in a state other than this State during the time beginning on
22 December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an election and ending on the date of the
23 election. (NRS 293.176)
24 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a declaration of
25 candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form for a declaration of
26 candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177) Section 3 of this bill sets forth
27 the form for the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan office.
28 Section 5 of this bill makes conforming changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy
29 for an independent candidate must be in the form set forth in section 3.
30 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and provides that
31 the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash, cashier’s check or certified
32 check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1) provides that such a fee may also be paid by
33 credit card if the filing officer accepts such a method of payment; (2) revises the description of
34 certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of existing law in
35 to this schedule of fees.
36 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified list of
37 candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary election or
38 general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once a week for 2
39 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of the election; (2) the
40 location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which the polling places will be open
41 for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill requires such notice to additionally contain:
42 (1) the names of the candidates; and (2) the office for which each candidate is running and, if
43 the office is partisan, the party under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill
44 similarly requires the names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the
45 presidential preference primary election and the major political party with which each
46 candidate is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
47 election. (NRS 298.670)
48 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the position of
49 election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an appointment, including a
50 requirement that the pupil is appointed without party affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222)
51 Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of
52 his or her affiliation with a political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the
53 pupil’s application to preregister or register to vote.
54 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training course to
55 each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and requires the Secretary of

Assembly Amendment No. 974 to Senate Bill No. 74 Third Reprint Page 5
56 State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, for the cost of the per diem
57 allowance and travel expenses of the county clerk or city clerk for attending such a course.
58 Existing law further authorizes the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or
59 city, as applicable, such costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city
60 clerk who attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
61 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary of State
62 and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section 8.5 of this bill instead
63 requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain other costs for a county or city
64 clerk relating to the training course. Section 46.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the
65 Contingency Account for allocation to the Secretary of State by the Interim Finance
66 Committee for certain expenses relating to the training course.
67 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as such from the
68 day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of the election has expired.
69 (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that members continue to serve as such
70 from the day of appointment.
71 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a majority
72 of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the candidate must be
73 declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on the ballot. (NRS 293.260,
74 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City
75 Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter § 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections
76 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide that for the purposes of determining the majority of the
77 votes cast in the primary election for an office for which voters may select more than one
78 candidate, each ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates
79 for that office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
80 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of candidates for
81 any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United States must contain an
82 additional line with a square in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.” (NRS
83 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead that the additional line on such a ballot must
84 contain a space in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.”
85 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin counting mail
86 ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the counting board to prepare to
87 count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3) establishes certain requirements for
88 counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931, 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and
89 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail
90 ballots before the polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7
91 a.m. on the day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
92 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper ballots.
93 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the Secretary
94 of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for counting a vote; and
95 (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing additional uniform
96 statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a
97 vote must be counted if: (1) a portion of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the
98 voter; (2) such a marking cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there
99 is some indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
100 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
101 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
102 audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials, including the voted, rejected and
103 spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391)
104 Section 14 of this bill provides that such election materials are subject to inspection for the
105 purposes of an election accuracy audit.
106 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration agency,
107 the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration agency is the last day to
108 register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county clerk to accept any application which
109 is completed by the last day to register to vote by mail if the county clerk receives the
110 application not later than 5 days after that date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688)
111 Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill require a voter registration agency, the Department of
112 Motor Vehicles and an automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to
113 vote after this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
114 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.

Assembly Amendment No. 974 to Senate Bill No. 74 Third Reprint Page 6
115 Existing law requires if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not affiliated with a
116 political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to list the person’s
117 or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead
118 requires the county clerk or field registrar to list the political party of a person or elector who
119 fails to indicate whether he or she is affiliated with a political party or not affiliated as “no
120 political party.”
121 Section 9.5 of this bill revises the manner in which certain candidates that appear under
122 existing law on a ballot as “no political party” or “NPP” to instead be shown on such a ballot:
123 (1) for a candidate for partisan office, as “Independent Candidate” or “INC”; and (2) for a
124 candidate for a nonpartisan office, as “nonpartisan” or “NPR.” (NRS 293.267)
125 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter from the
126 official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the name of a registered
127 voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction
128 in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice sent to his or her residence and has not voted or
129 appeared to vote for a period of time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52
130 U.S.C. § 20507) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and
131 conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
132 law.
133 Sections 20 and 23.5 of this bill provide that certain notifications that a county clerk is
134 required to mail to the current residence of a person are required instead to be mailed to the
135 current mailing address of the person. (NRS 293.530, 293.57693)
136 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration information
137 after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the county or city clerk to
138 authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration information by the use of a paper
139 application or the computer system established by the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832)
140 Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county or city clerk to also authorize an additional
141 method for updating such voter registration information at a polling place during early voting
142 by personal appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
143 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or more days
144 before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates information less than 14 days
145 before the election may vote only in person in that election only at a polling place. Finally,
146 section 24 clarifies that all other provisions of law relating to voting in person or by mail still
147 apply to a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration information after the close
148 of voter registration for the election.
149 Existing law prohibits a person from electioneering during the time a polling place for
150 early voting is open for voting in or within 100 feet from the entrance to the voting area. (NRS
151 293.361) Section 11.7 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100 feet of the entrance
152 to a building, other structure or jail in which a polling place is located.
153 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same election. (NRS
154 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a person from being
155 preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section
156 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more than once at the same election if he or she
157 votes: (1) more than once in certain elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or
158 general election in this State and at least one other state.
159 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to immediately
160 notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is informed of a confirmed
161 attack or attempted attack on the security of an information system used by the clerk or
162 official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by
163 regulation a cyber-incident response plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or
164 city clerk or other election official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the
165 Legislative Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of
166 an information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in accordance
167 with the cyber-incident response plan.
168 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or minor
169 child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the records of the
170 Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a county assessor be kept
171 confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 27, 40 and 41 of this bill
172 additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person to request that such information be
173 kept confidential.

Assembly Amendment No. 974 to Senate Bill No. 74 Third Reprint Page 7
174 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
175 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24 hours after
176 the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24 hours after the official
177 count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of the final ballot.
178 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for a
179 candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing for
180 candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days after the last day
181 for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill requires a withdrawal of candidacy
182 by a candidate for a city office to be presented within 7 days, consistent with the requirement
183 for all other candidates.
184 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any contributions
185 to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that no contribution made,
186 committed or accepted for a primary election or general election affects the limitation on
187 contributions for a special election to recall a public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of
188 this bill also provides that no contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election
189 other than a special election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for
190 a special election to recall a public officer.
191 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of presidential
192 electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United States not later than 6 days
193 before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, which is the first Tuesday after the
194 second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§ 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the
195 Secretary of State to transmit the certificate of ascertainment to the Archivist.
196 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major political party’s
197 nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on the ballot for a presidential
198 preference primary election to file with the Secretary of State a declaration of candidacy in the
199 form prescribed by the Secretary of State. (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the
200 form for the declaration of candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who
201 knowingly and willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
202 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
203 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
204 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a recount at
205 a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the number of registered
206 voters in the county and their political affiliation to the Secretary of State before certain
207 elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that deems certain registered voters who move
208 after the close of voter registration to retain their prior residence.

13 residency required by subsection 3 because a street address has not been assigned to
14 the candidate’s residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
15 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency required by
16 subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing officer:
17 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a governmental
18 agency that contains a photograph of the candidate; and
19 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that the filing

34 candidate in the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at that

36 filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The filing officer shall immediately
37 send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies to the candidate at the

39 a different address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail the
40 copy to the last address so designated.
41 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that a candidate
42 has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her civil rights restored, the
43 filing officer:
44 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the candidate has been
45 convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the candidate has had his or her civil rights
46 restored; and
47 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from such
