elections; providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is current and
2 valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g., NRS 293.269915,
3 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842, 293.5847, 293C.26314)
4 Section [1.3] 1.4 of this bill defines the term “current and valid” for such purposes and
5 section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to certain provisions relating to
6 elections.
7 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the preparation, distribution and
8 casting of mail ballots and requires a county or city clerk, as applicable, to prepare and
9 distribute to each active registered voter in the county or city and certain other persons
10 who register to vote a mail ballot for every election. (NRS 293.269911-293.269937,
11 293C.263-293C.26337) Sections 1.6, 11.3, 28.3 and 32.3 of this bill authorize an active
12 registered voter who is eligible to receive a mail ballot to submit a request to the county
13 or city clerk, as applicable, to receive a mail ballot if he or she is unable to access his or
14 her mail ballot or appear in person at the polls due to an emergency. Sections 1.6 and
15 28.3 further require a county or city clerk to distribute a mail ballot to such a voter after
16 verifying the voter’s eligibility and that he or she has not already voted. Sections 1.9,
17 11.5, 28.7 and 32.7 of this bill make certain provisions relating to mail ballots, including
18 the definition of “mail ballot” and provisions concerning the marking and signing the
19 mail ballot of another voter, applicable to ballots requested pursuant to sections 1.6 and
20 28.3.
21 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a major
22 political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain information on an
23 application to register to vote in a state other than this State during the time beginning on
24 December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an election and ending on the date of the
25 election. (NRS 293.176)
26 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a declaration of
27 candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form for a declaration of
28 candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177) Section 3 of this bill sets forth
29 the form for the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan office.
30 Section 5 of this bill makes conforming changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy
31 for an independent candidate must be in the form set forth in section 3.
32 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and provides that
33 the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash, cashier’s check or certified
34 check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1) provides that such a fee may also be paid by
35 credit card [;] if the filing officer accepts such a method of payment; (2) revises the
36 description of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of
37 existing law in to this schedule of fees.
38 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified list of
39 candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary election or
40 general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once a week for 2
41 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of the election; (2) the
42 location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which the polling places will be open
43 for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill requires such notice to additionally contain:
44 (1) the names of the candidates; and (2) the office for which each candidate is running and, if
45 the office is partisan, the party under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill
46 similarly requires the names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the
47 presidential preference primary election and the major political party with which each
48 candidate is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
49 election. (NRS 298.670)
50 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the position of
51 election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an appointment, including a
52 requirement that the pupil is appointed without party affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222)
53 Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of
54 his or her affiliation with a political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the
55 pupil’s application to preregister or register to vote.
Assembly Amendment No. 926 to Senate Bill No. 74 Second Reprint Page 5
56 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training course to
57 each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and requires the Secretary of
58 State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, for the cost of the per diem
59 allowance and travel expenses of the county clerk or city clerk for attending such a course.
60 Existing law further authorizes the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or
61 city, as applicable, such costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city
62 clerk who attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
63 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary of State
64 and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section 8.5 of this bill instead
65 requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain other costs for a county or city
66 clerk relating to the training course.
67 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as such from the
68 day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of the election has expired.
69 (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that members continue to serve as such
70 from the day of appointment.
71 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a majority
72 of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the candidate must be
73 declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on the ballot. (NRS 293.260,
74 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City
75 Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter § 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections
76 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide that for the purposes of determining the majority of the
77 votes cast in the primary election for an office for which voters may select more than one
78 candidate, each ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates
79 for that office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
80 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of candidates for
81 any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United States must contain an
82 additional line with a square in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.” (NRS
83 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead that the additional line on such a ballot must
84 contain a space in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.”
85 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin counting mail
86 ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the counting board to prepare to
87 count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3) establishes certain requirements for
88 counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931, 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and
89 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail
90 ballots before the polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7
91 a.m. on the day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
92 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper ballots.
93 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the Secretary
94 of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for counting a vote; and
95 (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing additional uniform
96 statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a
97 vote must be counted if: (1) a portion of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the
98 voter; (2) such a marking cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there
99 is some indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
100 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
101 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
102 audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials, including the voted, rejected and
103 spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391)
104 Section 14 of this bill provides that such election materials are subject to inspection for the
105 purposes of an election accuracy audit.
106 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration agency,
107 the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration agency is the last day to
108 register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county clerk to accept any application which
109 is completed by the last day to register to vote by mail if the county clerk receives the
110 application not later than 5 days after that date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688)
111 Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill require a voter registration agency, the Department of
112 Motor Vehicles and an automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to
113 vote after this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
114 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
Assembly Amendment No. 926 to Senate Bill No. 74 Second Reprint Page 6
115 Existing law requires [: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or an elector
116 at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party affiliation or that he
117 or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2)] if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not
118 affiliated with a political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to
119 list the person’s or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this
120 bill instead requires the county clerk or field registrar to list [such a person’s or elector’s] the
121 political party of a person or elector who fails to indicate whether he or she is affiliated
122 with a political party or not affiliated as “no political party.”
123 [Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for applications to
124 preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this bill requires an application
125 to preregister or register to vote to include an option for a voter to elect not to receive a mail
126 ballot.] Section 9.5 of this bill revises the manner in which certain candidates that appear
127 under existing law on a ballot as “no political party” or “NPP” to instead be shown on
128 such a ballot: (1) for a candidate for partisan office, as “Independent Candidate” or
129 “INC”; and (2) for a candidate for a nonpartisan office, as “nonpartisan” or “NPR.”
130 (NRS 293.267)
131 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter from the
132 official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the name of a registered
133 voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction
134 in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice sent to his or her residence and has not voted or
135 appeared to vote for a period of time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52
136 U.S.C. § 20507) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and
137 conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
138 law.
139 Sections 20 and 23.5 of this bill provide that certain notifications that a county clerk
140 is required to mail to the current residence of a person are required instead to be mailed
141 to the current mailing address of the person. (NRS 293.530, 293.57693)
142 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration information
143 after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the county or city clerk to
144 authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration information by the use of a paper
145 application or the computer system established by the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832)
146 Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county or city clerk to also authorize an additional
147 method for updating such voter registration information at a polling place during early voting
148 by personal appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
149 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or more days
150 before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates information less than 14 days
151 before the election may vote only in person in that election only at a polling place. Finally,
152 section 24 clarifies that all other provisions of law relating to voting in person or by mail still
153 apply to a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration information after the close
154 of voter registration for the election.
155 Existing law prohibits [, with certain exceptions,] a person from [performing certain
156 election-related actions] electioneering during the time a polling place for early voting is
157 open for voting in [certain locations, including] or within 100 feet from the entrance to [a
158 building or other structure in which a polling place is located. (NRS 293.740)] the voting
159 area. (NRS 293.361) Section [24.3] 11.7 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100
160 feet of the entrance to a [voting area.] building, other structure or jail in which a polling
161 place is located.
162 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same election. (NRS
163 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a person from being
164 preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section
165 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more than once at the same election if he or she
166 votes: (1) more than once in certain elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or
167 general election in this State and at least one other state.
168 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to immediately
169 notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is informed of a confirmed
170 attack or attempted attack on the security of an information system used by the clerk or
171 official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by
172 regulation a cyber-incident response plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or
173 city clerk or other election official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the
Assembly Amendment No. 926 to Senate Bill No. 74 Second Reprint Page 7
174 Legislative Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of
175 an information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in accordance
176 with the cyber-incident response plan.
177 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or minor
178 child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the records of the
179 Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a county assessor be kept
180 confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 27, 40 and 41 of this bill
181 additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person to request that such information be
182 kept confidential.
183 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
184 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24 hours after
185 the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24 hours after the official
186 count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of the final ballot.
187 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for a
188 candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing for
189 candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days after the last day
190 for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill requires a withdrawal of candidacy
191 by a candidate for a city office to be presented within 7 days, consistent with the requirement
192 for all other candidates.
193 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any contributions
194 to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that no contribution made,
195 committed or accepted for a primary election or general election affects the limitation on
196 contributions for a special election to recall a public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of
197 this bill also provides that no contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election
198 other than a special election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for
199 a special election to recall a public officer.
200 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of presidential
201 electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United States not later than 6 days
202 before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, which is the first Tuesday after the
203 second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§ 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the
204 Secretary of State to transmit the certificate of ascertainment to the Archivist.
205 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major political party’s
206 nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on the ballot for a presidential
207 preference primary election to file with the Secretary of State a declaration of candidacy in the
208 form prescribed by the Secretary of State. (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the
209 form for the declaration of candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who
210 knowingly and willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
211 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
212 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
213 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a recount at
214 a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the number of registered
215 voters in the county and their political affiliation to the Secretary of State before certain
216 elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that deems certain registered voters who move
217 after the close of voter registration to retain their prior residence.

12 registered voter who is eligible to receive a mail ballot to submit a request to the county
13 or city clerk, as applicable, to receive a mail ballot if he or she is unable to access his or
14 her mail ballot or appear in person at the polls due to an emergency. Sections 1.6 and
15 28.3 further require a county or city clerk to distribute a mail ballot to such a voter after
16 verifying the voter’s eligibility and that he or she has not already voted. Sections 1.9,
17 11.5, 28.7 and 32.7 of this bill make certain provisions relating to mail ballots, including
18 the definition of “mail ballot” and provisions concerning the marking and signing the
19 mail ballot of another voter, applicable to ballots requested pursuant to sections 1.6 and
20 28.3.
21 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a major
22 political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain information on an
23 application to register to vote in a state other than this State during the time beginning on
24 December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an election and ending on the date of the
25 election. (NRS 293.176)
26 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a declaration of
27 candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form for a declaration of
28 candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177) Section 3 of this bill sets forth
29 the form for the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan office.
30 Section 5 of this bill makes conforming changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy
31 for an independent candidate must be in the form set forth in section 3.
32 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and provides that
33 the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash, cashier’s check or certified

44 (1) the names of the candidates; and (2) the office for which each candidate is running and, if

47 presidential preference primary election and the major political party with which each
48 candidate is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary

50 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the position of
51 election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an appointment, including a
52 requirement that the pupil is appointed without party affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222)
53 Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of
54 his or her affiliation with a political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the

71 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a majority
72 of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the candidate must be
73 declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on the ballot. (NRS 293.260,
74 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City
75 Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter § 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections
76 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide that for the purposes of determining the majority of the
77 votes cast in the primary election for an office for which voters may select more than one
78 candidate, each ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates
79 for that office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
80 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of candidates for
81 any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United States must contain an
82 additional line with a square in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.” (NRS
83 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead that the additional line on such a ballot must
84 contain a space in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.”
85 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin counting mail
86 ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the counting board to prepare to

94 of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for counting a vote; and
95 (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing additional uniform
96 statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a
97 vote must be counted if: (1) a portion of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the
98 voter; (2) such a marking cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there
99 is some indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
100 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
101 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
102 audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials, including the voted, rejected and
103 spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391)
104 Section 14 of this bill provides that such election materials are subject to inspection for the
105 purposes of an election accuracy audit.
106 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration agency,
107 the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration agency is the last day to
108 register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county clerk to accept any application which
109 is completed by the last day to register to vote by mail if the county clerk receives the
110 application not later than 5 days after that date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688)
111 Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill require a voter registration agency, the Department of
112 Motor Vehicles and an automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to
113 vote after this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
114 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.

115 Existing law requires [: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or an elector
116 at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party affiliation or that he
117 or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2)] if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not
118 affiliated with a political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to
119 list the person’s or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this
120 bill instead requires the county clerk or field registrar to list [such a person’s or elector’s] the
121 political party of a person or elector who fails to indicate whether he or she is affiliated
122 with a political party or not affiliated as “no political party.”
123 [Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for applications to
124 preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this bill requires an application
125 to preregister or register to vote to include an option for a voter to elect not to receive a mail
126 ballot.] Section 9.5 of this bill revises the manner in which certain candidates that appear
127 under existing law on a ballot as “no political party” or “NPP” to instead be shown on
128 such a ballot: (1) for a candidate for partisan office, as “Independent Candidate” or
129 “INC”; and (2) for a candidate for a nonpartisan office, as “nonpartisan” or “NPR.”
130 (NRS 293.267)
131 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter from the
132 official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the name of a registered
133 voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction
134 in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice sent to his or her residence and has not voted or
135 appeared to vote for a period of time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52
136 U.S.C. § 20507) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and
137 conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
138 law.
139 Sections 20 and 23.5 of this bill provide that certain notifications that a county clerk
140 is required to mail to the current residence of a person are required instead to be mailed
141 to the current mailing address of the person. (NRS 293.530, 293.57693)
142 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration information
143 after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the county or city clerk to
144 authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration information by the use of a paper
145 application or the computer system established by the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832)
146 Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county or city clerk to also authorize an additional
147 method for updating such voter registration information at a polling place during early voting
148 by personal appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
149 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or more days
150 before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates information less than 14 days
151 before the election may vote only in person in that election only at a polling place. Finally,
152 section 24 clarifies that all other provisions of law relating to voting in person or by mail still
153 apply to a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration information after the close
154 of voter registration for the election.
155 Existing law prohibits [, with certain exceptions,] a person from [performing certain
156 election-related actions] electioneering during the time a polling place for early voting is
157 open for voting in [certain locations, including] or within 100 feet from the entrance to [a
158 building or other structure in which a polling place is located. (NRS 293.740)] the voting
159 area. (NRS 293.361) Section [24.3] 11.7 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100
160 feet of the entrance to a [voting area.] building, other structure or jail in which a polling
161 place is located.
162 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same election. (NRS
163 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a person from being
164 preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section
165 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more than once at the same election if he or she
166 votes: (1) more than once in certain elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or
167 general election in this State and at least one other state.
168 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to immediately
169 notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is informed of a confirmed
170 attack or attempted attack on the security of an information system used by the clerk or
171 official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by
172 regulation a cyber-incident response plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or
173 city clerk or other election official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the

Assembly Amendment No. 926 to Senate Bill No. 74 Second Reprint Page 7
174 Legislative Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of
175 an information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in accordance
176 with the cyber-incident response plan.
177 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or minor
178 child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the records of the
179 Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a county assessor be kept
180 confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 27, 40 and 41 of this bill
181 additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person to request that such information be
182 kept confidential.
183 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
184 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24 hours after
185 the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24 hours after the official
186 count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of the final ballot.
187 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for a
188 candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing for
189 candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days after the last day
190 for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill requires a withdrawal of candidacy
191 by a candidate for a city office to be presented within 7 days, consistent with the requirement
192 for all other candidates.
193 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any contributions
194 to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that no contribution made,
195 committed or accepted for a primary election or general election affects the limitation on
196 contributions for a special election to recall a public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of
197 this bill also provides that no contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election
198 other than a special election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for
199 a special election to recall a public officer.
200 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of presidential
201 electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United States not later than 6 days
202 before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, which is the first Tuesday after the
203 second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§ 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the
204 Secretary of State to transmit the certificate of ascertainment to the Archivist.
205 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major political party’s
206 nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on the ballot for a presidential
207 preference primary election to file with the Secretary of State a declaration of candidacy in the
208 form prescribed by the Secretary of State. (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the
209 form for the declaration of candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who
210 knowingly and willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
211 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
212 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
213 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a recount at
214 a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the number of registered
215 voters in the county and their political affiliation to the Secretary of State before certain
216 elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that deems certain registered voters who move
217 after the close of voter registration to retain their prior residence.

7 where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in accordance
8 with NRS 281.050, if one has been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not
9 be accepted for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following provisions

25 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency required by
26 subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing officer:
27 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a governmental
28 agency that contains a photograph of the candidate; and
29 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that the filing
30 officer determines is sufficient to verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to
31 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State

35 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency
36 provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or 4. Such a copy:

46 filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The filing officer shall immediately
47 send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies to the candidate at the

49 a different address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail the
50 copy to the last address so designated.
51 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that a candidate
52 has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her civil rights restored, the
53 filing officer:
