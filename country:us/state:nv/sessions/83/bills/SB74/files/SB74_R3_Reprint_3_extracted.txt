Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is
2 current and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g.,
3 NRS 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842,
4 293.5847, 293C.26314) Section 1.4 of this bill defines the term “current and valid”
5 for such purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to
6 certain provisions relating to elections.
7 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the preparation, distribution and
8 casting of mail ballots and requires a county or city clerk, as applicable, to prepare
9 and distribute to each active registered voter in the county or city and certain other
10 persons who register to vote a mail ballot for every election. (NRS 293.269911-
11 293.269937, 293C.263-293C.26337) Sections 1.6, 11.3, 28.3 and 32.3 of this bill
12 authorize an active registered voter who is eligible to receive a mail ballot to submit
13 a request to the county or city clerk, as applicable, to receive a mail ballot if he or
14 she is unable to access his or her mail ballot or appear in person at the polls due to
15 an emergency. Sections 1.6 and 28.3 further require a county or city clerk to
16 distribute a mail ballot to such a voter after verifying the voter’s eligibility and that
17 he or she has not already voted. Sections 1.9, 11.5, 28.7 and 32.7 of this bill make
18 certain provisions relating to mail ballots, including the definition of “mail ballot”
19 and provisions concerning the marking and signing the mail ballot of another voter,
20 applicable to ballots requested pursuant to sections 1.6 and 28.3.
21 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
22 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
23 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
24 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
25 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
26 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
27 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
28 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
29 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
30 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
31 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
32 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
33 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
34 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
35 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
36 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card if the filing officer accepts
37 such a method of payment; (2) revises the description of certain offices; and (3)
38 reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of existing law in to this
39 schedule of fees.
40 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
41 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
-
*SB74_R3*
– 3 –
42 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
43 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
44 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
45 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
46 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
47 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
48 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
49 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
50 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
51 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
52 election. (NRS 298.670)
53 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
54 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
55 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
56 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
57 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
58 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
59 application to preregister or register to vote.
60 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training
61 course to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and
62 requires the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as
63 applicable, for the cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county
64 clerk or city clerk for attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the
65 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such
66 costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city clerk who
67 attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
68 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary
69 of State and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section
70 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain
71 other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the training course.
72 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
73 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
74 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
75 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.
76 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
77 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
78 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
79 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
80 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
81 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
82 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
83 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
84 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
85 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
86 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
87 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
88 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
89 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
90 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
91 select “None of these candidates.”
92 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
93 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
94 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
95 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
96 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
-
*SB74_R3*
– 4 –
97 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
98 polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7 a.m. on the
99 day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
100 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper
101 ballots.
102 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
103 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
104 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
105 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
106 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a vote must be counted if: (1) a portion
107 of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking
108 cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there is some
109 indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
110 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
111 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
112 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
113 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
114 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
115 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
116 accuracy audit.
117 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
118 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
119 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
120 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
121 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
122 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
123 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
124 automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to vote after
125 this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
126 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
127 Existing law requires if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not
128 affiliated with a political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field
129 registrar to list the person’s or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS
130 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead requires the county clerk or field registrar to
131 list the political party of a person or elector who fails to indicate whether he or she
132 is affiliated with a political party or not affiliated as “no political party.”
133 Section 9.5 of this bill revises the manner in which certain candidates that
134 appear under existing law on a ballot as “no political party” or “NPP” to instead be
135 shown on such a ballot: (1) for a candidate for partisan office, as “Independent
136 Candidate” or “INC”; and (2) for a candidate for a nonpartisan office, as
137 “nonpartisan” or “NPR.” (NRS 293.267)
138 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
139 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
140 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
141 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
142 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
143 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
144 Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and conduct
145 any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
146 law.
147 Sections 20 and 23.5 of this bill provide that certain notifications that a county
148 clerk is required to mail to the current residence of a person are required instead to
149 be mailed to the current mailing address of the person. (NRS 293.530, 293.57693)
150 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
151 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
-
*SB74_R3*
– 5 –
152 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
153 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
154 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
155 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
156 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
157 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
158 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
159 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
160 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
161 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
162 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
163 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
164 for the election.
165 Existing law prohibits a person from electioneering during the time a polling
166 place for early voting is open for voting in or within 100 feet from the entrance to
167 the voting area. (NRS 293.361) Section 11.7 of this bill instead prohibits such
168 actions within 100 feet of the entrance to a building, other structure or jail in which
169 a polling place is located.
170 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same
171 election. (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a
172 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a
173 time. (NRS 293.810) Section 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more
174 than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more than once in certain
175 elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or general election in this State
176 and at least one other state.
177 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
178 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
179 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
180 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
181 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
182 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
183 official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the Legislative
184 Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of an
185 information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in
186 accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
187 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
188 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
189 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
190 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
191 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person
192 to request that such information be kept confidential.
193 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
194 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24
195 hours after the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24
196 hours after the official count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of
197 the final ballot.
198 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
199 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
200 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
201 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
202 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
203 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.
204 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
205 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
206 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
-
*SB74_R3*
– 6 –
207 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
208 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
209 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
210 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
211 election to recall a public officer.
212 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
213 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
214 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
215 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
216 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
217 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
218 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
219 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
220 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
221 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
222 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
223 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
224 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
225 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
226 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
227 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a
228 recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the
229 number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation to the
230 Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that
231 deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter registration to
232 retain their prior residence.

13 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is
2 current and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g.,
3 NRS 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842,
4 293.5847, 293C.26314) Section 1.4 of this bill defines the term “current and valid”
5 for such purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to
6 certain provisions relating to elections.
7 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the preparation, distribution and
8 casting of mail ballots and requires a county or city clerk, as applicable, to prepare
9 and distribute to each active registered voter in the county or city and certain other
10 persons who register to vote a mail ballot for every election. (NRS 293.269911-
11 293.269937, 293C.263-293C.26337) Sections 1.6, 11.3, 28.3 and 32.3 of this bill
12 authorize an active registered voter who is eligible to receive a mail ballot to submit
13 a request to the county or city clerk, as applicable, to receive a mail ballot if he or
14 she is unable to access his or her mail ballot or appear in person at the polls due to
15 an emergency. Sections 1.6 and 28.3 further require a county or city clerk to
16 distribute a mail ballot to such a voter after verifying the voter’s eligibility and that
17 he or she has not already voted. Sections 1.9, 11.5, 28.7 and 32.7 of this bill make
18 certain provisions relating to mail ballots, including the definition of “mail ballot”
19 and provisions concerning the marking and signing the mail ballot of another voter,
20 applicable to ballots requested pursuant to sections 1.6 and 28.3.
21 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a
22 major political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain
23 information on an application to register to vote in a state other than this State
24 during the time beginning on December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an
25 election and ending on the date of the election. (NRS 293.176)
26 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a
27 declaration of candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form
28 for a declaration of candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177)
29 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of candidacy for an
30 independent candidate for partisan office. Section 5 of this bill makes conforming
31 changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate
32 must be in the form set forth in section 3.
33 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and
34 provides that the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash,
35 cashier’s check or certified check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
36 provides that such a fee may also be paid by credit card if the filing officer accepts
37 such a method of payment; (2) revises the description of certain offices; and (3)
38 reorganizes existing fees set forth in other provisions of existing law in to this
39 schedule of fees.
40 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified
41 list of candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary
-
*SB74_R3*

– 3 –
42 election or general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once
43 a week for 2 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of
44 the election; (2) the location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which
45 the polling places will be open for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill
46 requires such notice to additionally contain: (1) the names of the candidates; and (2)
47 the office for which each candidate is running and, if the office is partisan, the party
48 under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill similarly requires the
49 names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the presidential
50 preference primary election and the major political party with which each candidate
51 is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
52 election. (NRS 298.670)
53 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the
54 position of election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an
55 appointment, including a requirement that the pupil is appointed without party
56 affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a
57 pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of his or her affiliation with a
58 political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the pupil’s
59 application to preregister or register to vote.
60 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training
61 course to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and
62 requires the Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as
63 applicable, for the cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county
64 clerk or city clerk for attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the
65 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such
66 costs for any deputy or employee of the office of the county or city clerk who
67 attends the course. Existing law requires that any such costs be paid from the
68 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon recommendation by the Secretary
69 of State and approval by the State Board of Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section
70 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to provide or reimburse certain
71 other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the training course.
72 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as
73 such from the day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of
74 the election has expired. (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that
75 members continue to serve as such from the day of appointment.
76 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a
77 majority of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the
78 candidate must be declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on
79 the ballot. (NRS 293.260, 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City
80 Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter §
81 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide
82 that for the purposes of determining the majority of the votes cast in the primary
83 election for an office for which voters may select more than one candidate, each
84 ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates for that
85 office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
86 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of
87 candidates for any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United
88 States must contain an additional line with a square in which the voter may select
89 “None of these candidates.” (NRS 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead
90 that the additional line on such a ballot must contain a space in which the voter may
91 select “None of these candidates.”
92 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin
93 counting mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the
94 counting board to prepare to count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3)
95 establishes certain requirements for counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931,
96 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that
-
*SB74_R3*

– 4 –
97 the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail ballots before the
98 polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7 a.m. on the
99 day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
100 posted until the polls are closed; and (4) remove requirements for counting paper
101 ballots.
102 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the
103 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for
104 counting a vote; and (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
105 establishing additional uniform statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369)
106 Sections 13 and 34 of this bill provide that a vote must be counted if: (1) a portion
107 of the designated space on a ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking
108 cannot be conclusively determined to be made in error; and (3) there is some
109 indication of the intent of the voter on the face of the ballot.
110 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
111 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to
112 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials,
113 including the voted, rejected and spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in
114 the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391) Section 14 of this bill provides that
115 such election materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election
116 accuracy audit.
117 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration
118 agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration
119 agency is the last day to register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county
120 clerk to accept any application which is completed by the last day to register to vote
121 by mail if the county clerk receives the application not later than 5 days after that
122 date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688) Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill
123 require a voter registration agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles and an
124 automatic voter registration agency to notify a person who registers to vote after
125 this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the person must register
126 to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early voting.
127 Existing law requires if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not
128 affiliated with a political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field
129 registrar to list the person’s or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS
130 293.518) Section 18 of this bill instead requires the county clerk or field registrar to
131 list the political party of a person or elector who fails to indicate whether he or she
132 is affiliated with a political party or not affiliated as “no political party.”
133 Section 9.5 of this bill revises the manner in which certain candidates that
134 appear under existing law on a ballot as “no political party” or “NPP” to instead be
135 shown on such a ballot: (1) for a candidate for partisan office, as “Independent
136 Candidate” or “INC”; and (2) for a candidate for a nonpartisan office, as
137 “nonpartisan” or “NPR.” (NRS 293.267)
138 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter
139 from the official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the
140 name of a registered voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence
141 outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice
142 sent to his or her residence and has not voted or appeared to vote for a period of
143 time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52 U.S.C. § 20507)
144 Sections 20 and 21 of this bill require a county clerk to mail a notice and conduct
145 any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing federal
146 law.
147 Sections 20 and 23.5 of this bill provide that certain notifications that a county
148 clerk is required to mail to the current residence of a person are required instead to
149 be mailed to the current mailing address of the person. (NRS 293.530, 293.57693)
150 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration
151 information after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the
-
*SB74_R3*

– 5 –
152 county or city clerk to authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration
153 information by the use of a paper application or the computer system established by
154 the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832) Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county
155 or city clerk to also authorize an additional method for updating such voter
156 registration information at a polling place during early voting by personal
157 appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
158 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or
159 more days before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates
160 information less than 14 days before the election may vote only in person in that
161 election only at a polling place. Finally, section 24 clarifies that all other provisions
162 of law relating to voting in person or by mail still apply to a registered voter who
163 updates his or her voter registration information after the close of voter registration
164 for the election.
165 Existing law prohibits a person from electioneering during the time a polling
166 place for early voting is open for voting in or within 100 feet from the entrance to
167 the voting area. (NRS 293.361) Section 11.7 of this bill instead prohibits such
168 actions within 100 feet of the entrance to a building, other structure or jail in which
169 a polling place is located.
170 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same
171 election. (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a
172 person from being preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a
173 time. (NRS 293.810) Section 24.7 of this bill provides that a person votes more
174 than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more than once in certain
175 elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or general election in this State
176 and at least one other state.
177 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to
178 immediately notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is
179 informed of a confirmed attack or attempted attack on the security of an
180 information system used by the clerk or official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this
181 bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation a cyber-incident response
182 plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or city clerk or other election
183 official to notify the Secretary of State, the Governor and the Legislative
184 Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of an
185 information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in
186 accordance with the cyber-incident response plan.
187 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or
188 minor child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the
189 records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a
190 county assessor be kept confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections
191 27, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally authorize the elderly parent of such a person
192 to request that such information be kept confidential.
193 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
194 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24
195 hours after the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24
196 hours after the official count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of
197 the final ballot.
198 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for
199 a candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing
200 for candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days
201 after the last day for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill
202 requires a withdrawal of candidacy by a candidate for a city office to be presented
203 within 7 days, consistent with the requirement for all other candidates.
204 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any
205 contributions to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that
206 no contribution made, committed or accepted for a primary election or general
-
*SB74_R3*

– 6 –
207 election affects the limitation on contributions for a special election to recall a
208 public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of this bill also provides that no
209 contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election other than a special
210 election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for a special
211 election to recall a public officer.
212 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of
213 presidential electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United
214 States not later than 6 days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors,
215 which is the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§
216 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to transmit the certificate
217 of ascertainment to the Archivist.
218 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major
219 political party’s nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on
220 the ballot for a presidential preference primary election to file with the Secretary of
221 State a declaration of candidacy in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
222 (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the form for the declaration of
223 candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who knowingly and
224 willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
225 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
226 Section 48 repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
227 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a
228 recount at a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the
229 number of registered voters in the county and their political affiliation to the
230 Secretary of State before certain elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that
231 deems certain registered voters who move after the close of voter registration to
232 retain their prior residence.

10 address of the residence where the candidate actually, as opposed to
11 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050, if one has
12 been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
13 for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
14 provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of
15 subsection 4:
16 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post
17 office box unless a street address has not been assigned to his or her

28 4. If the candidate executes an oath or affirmation under
29 penalty of perjury stating that the candidate is unable to present to
30 the filing officer the proof of residency required by subsection 3
31 because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s
32 residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
33 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency
34 required by subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing
35 officer:
36 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
37 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;
38 and

43 regulations establishing the forms of alternative proof of the
44 candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to

6 (a) May not be withheld from the public; and

10 deemed to have appointed the filing officer for the office as his or
11 her agent for service of process for the purposes of a proceeding
12 pursuant to NRS 293.182. Service of such process must first be
13 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
14 the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at
15 that address, service must be made by personally delivering to and
16 leaving with the filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The
17 filing officer shall immediately send, by registered or certified mail,
18 one of the copies to the candidate at the specified address, unless the
19 candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer a different
20 address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail
21 the copy to the last address so designated.
22 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that
23 a candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
24 civil rights restored, the filing officer:
25 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the
26 candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
27 candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and
28 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from
29 such investigation to the Attorney General, if the filing officer is the
30 Secretary of State, or to the district attorney, if the filing officer is a
31 person other than the Secretary of State.
32 8. The receipt of information by the Attorney General or
33 district attorney pursuant to subsection 7 must be treated as a
34 challenge of a candidate pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 of NRS
35 293.182 to which the provisions of NRS 293.2045 apply.
36 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration
37 of candidacy which contains a false statement in violation of this
38 section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
39 Sec. 4. NRS 293.193 is hereby amended to read as follows:
