Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person to provide certain documentation which is current
2 and valid for purposes of certain provisions relating to elections. (See e.g., NRS
3 293.269915, 293.2725, 293.507, 293.5742, 293.57688, 293.5837, 293.5842, 293.5847,
4 293C.26314) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “current and valid” for such
5 purposes and section 1.7 of this bill makes that definition applicable to certain provisions
6 relating to elections.
7 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved electronic
8 transmission through which: (1) certain military and overseas electors and voters; (2) certain
9 electors and registered voters with a disability; or (3) certain electors and registered voters
10 who are tribal members may register to vote, request a ballot and cast a ballot. (NRS
11 293.269951, 293D.200) Sections [1] 1.5 and 28 of this bill require the Secretary of State to
12 allow any registered voter to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply for
13 and cast a ballot if the registered voter: (1) does not have access to his or her mail ballot; [and]
14 or (2) is unable to go to the polls because of an illness or disability resulting in confinement,
15 hospitalization, serious illness or is suddenly called away from home. Sections 16 and 35 of
16 this bill authorize the county and city clerks to notify the public of the provisions of sections
17 [1] 1.5 and 28 [.] , respectively.
18 Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition for a person to be a candidate of a major
19 political party for partisan office if the person has changed certain information on an
20 application to register to vote in a state other than this State during the time beginning on
21 December 31 preceding the closing filing date for an election and ending on the date of the
22 election. (NRS 293.176)
23 Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file a declaration of
24 candidacy. (NRS 293.200) Existing law further sets forth the form for a declaration of
25 candidacy for all candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.177) Section 3 of this bill sets forth
26 the form for the declaration of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan office.
27 Section 5 of this bill makes conforming changes to clarify that the declaration of candidacy
28 for an independent candidate must be in the form set forth in section 3.
29 Existing law sets forth certain fees for filing a declaration of candidacy and provides that
30 the fee for filing a declaration of candidacy may be paid by cash, cashier’s check or certified
31 check. (NRS 293.193) Section 4 of this bill: (1) provides that such a fee may also be paid by
32 credit card; (2) revises the description of certain offices; and (3) reorganizes existing fees set
33 forth in other provisions of existing law in to this schedule of fees.
34 Existing law requires a county clerk, immediately upon receipt of the certified list of
35 candidates for judicial and nonjudicial office, to publish a notice of primary election or
36 general election in a newspaper of general circulation in the county once a week for 2
37 successive weeks and requires such notice to contain: (1) the date of the election; (2) the
38 location of the polling places; and (3) the hours during which the polling places will be open
39 for voting. (NRS 293.203) Section 6 of this bill requires such notice to additionally contain:
40 (1) the names of the candidates; and (2) the office for which each candidate is running and, if
41 the office is partisan, the party under which the candidate is running. Section 39 of this bill
42 similarly requires the names of the qualified candidates who will be on the ballot at the
43 presidential preference primary election and the major political party with which each
44 candidate is affiliated to be included on such notice for a presidential preference primary
45 election. (NRS 298.670)
46 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to appoint a pupil as a trainee for the position of
47 election board officer and sets forth the qualifications for such an appointment, including a
48 requirement that the pupil is appointed without party affiliation. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222)
49 Sections 7 and 31 of this bill clarify that a pupil may be appointed as a trainee regardless of
50 his or her affiliation with a political party, including any designation of party affiliation on the
51 pupil’s application to preregister or register to vote.
52 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to develop and provide a training course
53 to each county clerk and city clerk related to elections procedures and requires the
54 Secretary of State to provide to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, for the
55 cost of the per diem allowance and travel expenses of the county clerk or city clerk for

Senate Amendment No. 344 to Senate Bill No. 74 Page 5
56 attending such a course. Existing law further authorizes the Secretary of State to provide
57 to or reimburse the county or city, as applicable, such costs for any deputy or employee
58 of the office of the county or city clerk who attends the course. Existing law requires that
59 any such costs be paid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account upon
60 recommendation by the Secretary of State and approval by the State Board of
61 Examiners. (NRS 293.2504) Section 8.5 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State
62 to provide or reimburse certain other costs for a county or city clerk relating to the
63 training course.
64 Existing law provides that members of election boards continue to serve as such from the
65 day before the day of the election until the time for filing contests of the election has expired.
66 (NRS 293.225) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that members continue to serve as such
67 from the day of appointment.
68 Existing law provides that, in certain circumstances, if one candidate receives a majority
69 of the votes cast in a primary election for certain nonpartisan offices, the candidate must be
70 declared elected and the candidate’s name must not be placed on the ballot. (NRS 293.260,
71 293C.175; Carson City Charter § 5.010; Henderson City Charter § 5.010; Las Vegas City
72 Charter § 5.010; North Las Vegas City Charter § 5.020; Sparks City Charter § 5.020) Sections
73 9, 29 and 42-46 of this bill provide that for the purposes of determining the majority of the
74 votes cast in the primary election for an office for which voters may select more than one
75 candidate, each ballot upon which a voter marked a valid choice for one or more candidates
76 for that office shall be deemed to be one vote cast in the primary election for that office.
77 Existing law provides that every ballot upon which appears the names of candidates for
78 any statewide office or for President or Vice President of the United States must contain an
79 additional line with a square in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.” (NRS
80 293.269) Section 10 of this bill provides instead that the additional line on such a ballot must
81 contain a space in which the voter may select “None of these candidates.”
82 Existing law: (1) authorizes the mail ballot central counting board to begin counting mail
83 ballots 15 days before the day of the election; (2) requires the counting board to prepare to
84 count the ballots when the polls are closed; and (3) establishes certain requirements for
85 counting paper ballots. (NRS 293.269931, 293.363, 293C.26331, 293C.362) Sections 12 and
86 33 of this bill: (1) clarify that the mail ballot central counting board may begin counting mail
87 ballots before the polls are closed; (2) prohibit certain ballots from being counted before 7
88 a.m. on the day of the election; (3) prohibit the results or a copy of the results from being
89 posted until the polls are closed; and [(2)] (4) remove requirements for counting paper
90 ballots.
91 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain standards for counting votes; (2) requires the Secretary
92 of State to adopt regulations establishing uniform, statewide standards for counting a vote; and
93 (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing additional uniform
94 statewide standards. (NRS 293.3677, 293C.369) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill [authorize the
95 Secretary of State to establish uniform thresholds for determining whether writing or] provide
96 that a [mark] vote must be counted [as] if: (1) a [vote.] portion of the designated space on a
97 ballot is darkened by the voter; (2) such a marking cannot be conclusively determined to
98 be made in error; and (3) there is some indication of the intent of the voter on the face of
99 the ballot.
100 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
101 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 15 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
102 audits.” Existing law provides that certain election materials, including the voted, rejected and
103 spoiled ballots, must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293.391)
104 Section 14 of this bill provides that such election materials are subject to inspection for the
105 purposes of an election accuracy audit.
106 Existing law provides that the deadline to register to vote at a voter registration agency,
107 the Department of Motor Vehicles or an automatic voter registration agency is the last day to
108 register to vote by mail. Existing law requires a county clerk to accept any application which
109 is completed by the last day to register to vote by mail if the county clerk receives the
110 application not later than 5 days after that date. (NRS 293.504, 293.5727, 293.57688)
111 Sections 17, 22 and 23 of this bill require a voter registration agency, the Department of
112 Motor Vehicles and an automatic voter registration agency to notify a [voter] person who
113 registers to vote after this deadline that in order to vote in the upcoming election, the [voter]

Senate Amendment No. 344 to Senate Bill No. 74 Page 6
114 person must register to vote by computer or at a polling place or polling place for early
115 voting.
116 Existing law requires: (1) a person at the time he or she preregisters to vote or an elector
117 at the time he or she registers to vote, to indicate his or her political party affiliation or that he
118 or she is not affiliated with a party; and (2) if a person or elector indicates that he or she is not
119 affiliated with a political party or fails to indicate as such, the county clerk or field registrar to
120 list the person’s or elector’s political party as nonpartisan. (NRS 293.518) Section 18 of this
121 bill instead requires the county clerk or field registrar to list such a person’s or elector’s
122 political party as “no political party.”
123 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form for applications to
124 preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.5235) Section 19 of this bill requires an application
125 to preregister or register to vote to include an option for a voter to elect not to receive a mail
126 ballot. [Sections 11 and 32 of this bill make conforming changes to provide that a county clerk
127 and city clerk shall not distribute a mail ballot to a person who has elected not to receive a
128 mail ballot.]
129 Existing federal law sets forth certain requirements for the removal of a voter from the
130 official list of eligible voters which prohibit a state from removing the name of a registered
131 voter unless the voter: (1) confirms a change of residence outside of the registrar’s jurisdiction
132 in writing; or (2) fails to respond to a notice sent to his or her residence and has not voted or
133 appeared to vote for a period of time after a notice has been mailed to his or her residence. (52
134 U.S.C. § 20507) Sections 20 [,] and 21 [and 25] of this bill require a county clerk to mail a
135 notice and conduct any correction or removal of a registered voter in accordance with existing
136 federal law.
137 Existing law: (1) authorizes a voter to update his or her voter registration information
138 after the close of registration for an election; and (2) requires the county or city clerk to
139 authorize a voter to update his or her voter registration information by the use of a paper
140 application or the computer system established by the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.5832)
141 Section 24 of this bill authorizes the county or city clerk to also authorize an additional
142 method for updating such voter registration information at a polling place during early voting
143 by personal appearance and on election day. Section 24 further: (1) requires the county or city
144 clerk to send a mail ballot to such a voter if the voter updates the information 14 or more days
145 before the election; and (2) provides that a voter who updates information less than 14 days
146 before the election may vote only in person in that election only at a polling place. Finally,
147 section 24 clarifies that all other provisions of law relating to voting in person or by mail still
148 apply to a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration information after the close
149 of voter registration for the election.
150 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from performing certain
151 election-related actions in certain locations, including within 100 feet from the entrance
152 to a building or other structure in which a polling place is located. (NRS 293.740) Section
153 24.3 of this bill instead prohibits such actions within 100 feet of the entrance to a voting
154 area.
155 Existing law prohibits a person from voting more than once at the same election.
156 (NRS 293.780) Section 48 of this bill repeals existing law that prohibits a person from being
157 preregistered or registered to vote in more than one county at a time. (NRS 293.810) Section
158 [25 instead prohibits] 24.7 of this bill provides that a person [from being preregistered or
159 registered to vote] votes more than once at the same election if he or she votes: (1) more
160 than once in [more than one] certain elections in this State; or (2) in the same primary or
161 general election in this State and at least one other state . [at a time.]
162 Existing law requires a county or city clerk or other election official to immediately
163 notify the Secretary of State if the clerk or official identifies or is informed of a confirmed
164 attack or attempted attack on the security of an information system used by the clerk or
165 official. (NRS 293.875) Section 26 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt by
166 regulation a cyber-incident response plan for elections. Section 26 also requires a county or
167 city clerk or other election official to notify the Secretary of State , the Governor and the
168 Legislative Commission of any cyber-incident or attempted cyber-incident on the security of
169 an information system used by the county or city clerk or other election official in accordance
170 with the cyber-incident response plan.
171 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including a spouse, domestic partner or minor
172 child of such a person, to request that personal information contained in the records of the

Senate Amendment No. 344 to Senate Bill No. 74 Page 7
173 Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, a county recorder or a county assessor be kept
174 confidential. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 27, 40 and 41 of this bill
175 additionally authorize the elderly [dependent] parent of such a person to request that such
176 information be kept confidential.
177 Section 27.5 of this bill clarifies that certain tests required by existing law to be
178 conducted before the start of the official count of the ballots and again within 24 hours
179 after the official count of the ballots are required to be conducted within 24 hours after
180 the official count of the ballots is completed, including the counting of the final ballot.
181 Existing law provides that a withdrawal of candidacy must be presented: (1) for a
182 candidate for city office, to the city clerk within 2 days after the last day for filing for
183 candidacy; and (2) for all other candidates, to the county clerk within 7 days after the last day
184 for filing. (NRS 293.202, 293C.195) Section 30 of this bill requires a withdrawal of candidacy
185 by a candidate for a city office to be presented within 7 days, consistent with the requirement
186 for all other candidates.
187 Existing law sets forth certain limits on making or committing to make any contributions
188 to a candidate for office, except for a federal office, and provides that no contribution made,
189 committed or accepted for a primary election or general election affects the limitation on
190 contributions for a special election to recall a public officer. (NRS 294A.100) Section 36 of
191 this bill also provides that no contribution made, committed or accepted for a special election
192 other than a special election to recall a public officer affects the limitation on contributions for
193 a special election to recall a public officer.
194 Existing federal law requires a certificate of ascertainment of appointment of presidential
195 electors to be issued and transmitted to the Archivist of the United States not later than 6 days
196 before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, which is the first Tuesday after the
197 second Wednesday in December. (3 U.S.C. §§ 5, 7) Section 37 of this bill requires the
198 Secretary of State to transmit the certificate of ascertainment to the Archivist.
199 Existing law requires a person who is a qualified candidate to be a major political party’s
200 nominee for President of the United States who wants to appear on the ballot for a presidential
201 preference primary election to file with the Secretary of State a declaration of candidacy in the
202 form prescribed by the Secretary of State. (NRS 298.660) Section 38 of this bill sets forth the
203 form for the declaration of candidacy for such a candidate and provides that any person who
204 knowingly and willfully files a declaration of candidacy which contains a false statement in
205 violation is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
206 Section 48 [of this bill] repeals certain provisions that: (1) prohibit a counting board from
207 commencing to count the votes until all ballots are accounted for; (2) provide for a recount at
208 a hearing of any contest; and (3) require the county clerk to transmit the number of registered
209 voters in the county and their political affiliation to the Secretary of State before certain
210 elections. Section 48 also repeals a provision that deems certain registered voters who move
211 after the close of voter registration to retain their prior residence.
