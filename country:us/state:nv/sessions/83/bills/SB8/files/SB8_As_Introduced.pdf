EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to disability services; revising the categories of
persons who receive certain services from the Aging and
Disability Services Division of the Department of Health
and Human Services; renaming the Attorney for the
Rights of Older Persons and Persons with a Physical
Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a Related
Condition; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Office of Attorney for the Rights of Older Persons and
2 Persons with a Physical Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a Related Condition
3 within the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and
4 Human Services. (NRS 427A.123) Existing law also requires: (1) the Governor to
5 appoint the Attorney for the Rights of Older Persons and Persons with a Physical
6 Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a Related Condition; and (2) the Attorney to
7 provide advocacy, training and technical assistance relating to the legal rights of
8 older persons and persons with a physical disability, an intellectual disability or a
9 related condition. (NRS 427A.1232, 427A.1234) Existing law also provides for and
10 regulates services for persons with intellectual disabilities and developmental
11 disabilities. (Chapter 435 of NRS) Sections 1, 5 and 6 of this bill substitute the
12 term “person with a developmental disability” for the term “person with a related
-
*SB8*

– 2 –
13 condition” in provisions relating to the Attorney. Section 2 of this bill defines the
14 term “person with an intellectual disability,” as used in provisions relating to the
15 Attorney, to mean a person with an intellectual disability, as the term “intellectual
16 disability” is currently defined in existing law governing services for persons with
17 intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities. (NRS 435.007) Sections 1,
18 2, 5 and 6 thereby ensure that those categories of persons served by the Attorney
19 are the same categories of persons who receive services for persons with
20 intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities. Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7 of this
21 bill accordingly revise the title of the Attorney to “Attorney for the Rights of Older
22 Persons and Persons with a Physical Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a
23 Developmental Disability.”
24 Existing law authorizes the Division to establish by regulation a program to
25 facilitate the transition of older persons and persons with physical disabilities,
26 persons with intellectual disabilities and persons with related conditions from a
27 hospital to their places of residence. (NRS 427A.290) Section 8 of this bill: (1)
28 substitutes the term “developmental disability” for “related condition”; and (2)
29 provides that the term “intellectual disability” has the same definition as in
30 provisions governing services for persons with intellectual disabilities and
31 developmental disabilities. Section 8 thereby ensures that those categories of
32 persons eligible for assistance through the program are the same as the categories of
33 persons who receive services for persons with intellectual disabilities and
34 developmental disabilities.
