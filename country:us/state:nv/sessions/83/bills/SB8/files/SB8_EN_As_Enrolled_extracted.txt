Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to disability services; revising the categories of
persons who receive certain services from the Aging and
Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and
Human Services; renaming the Attorney for the Rights of
Older Persons and Persons with a Physical Disability, an
Intellectual Disability or a Related Condition; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Office of Attorney for the Rights of Older Persons and
Persons with a Physical Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a Related Condition
within the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and
Human Services. (NRS 427A.123) Existing law also requires: (1) the Governor to
appoint the Attorney for the Rights of Older Persons and Persons with a Physical
Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a Related Condition; and (2) the Attorney to
provide advocacy, training and technical assistance relating to the legal rights of
older persons and persons with a physical disability, an intellectual disability or a
related condition. (NRS 427A.1232, 427A.1234) Existing law also provides for and
regulates services for persons with intellectual disabilities and developmental
disabilities. (Chapter 435 of NRS) Sections 1, 5 and 6 of this bill substitute the
term “person with a developmental disability” for the term “person with a related
condition” in provisions relating to the Attorney. Section 2 of this bill defines the
term “person with an intellectual disability,” as used in provisions relating to the
Attorney, to mean a person with an intellectual disability, as the term “intellectual
disability” is currently defined in existing law governing services for persons with
intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities. (NRS 435.007) Sections 1,
2, 5 and 6 thereby ensure that those categories of persons served by the Attorney
are the same categories of persons who receive services for persons with
intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities. Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7 of this
bill accordingly revise the title of the Attorney to “Attorney for the Rights of Older
Persons and Persons with a Physical Disability, an Intellectual Disability or a
Developmental Disability.”
Existing law authorizes the Division to establish by regulation a program to
facilitate the transition of older persons and persons with physical disabilities,
persons with intellectual disabilities and persons with related conditions from a
hospital to their places of residence. (NRS 427A.290) Section 8 of this bill: (1)
substitutes the term “developmental disability” for “related condition”; and (2)
provides that the term “intellectual disability” has the same definition as in
provisions governing services for persons with intellectual disabilities and
developmental disabilities. Section 8 thereby ensures that those categories of
persons eligible for assistance through the program are the same as the categories of
persons who receive services for persons with intellectual disabilities and
developmental disabilities.
