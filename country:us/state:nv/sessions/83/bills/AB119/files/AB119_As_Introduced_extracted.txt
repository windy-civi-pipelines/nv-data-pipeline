AN ACT relating to paramilitary activity; authorizing the Attorney
General to investigate alleged paramilitary activity and
issue written investigative demands in connection with
any such investigation; authorizing the Attorney General
to seek an injunction against a person or group of persons
who has engaged in or is about to engage in paramilitary
activity; creating a cause of action for a person who has
suffered injury as a result of paramilitary activity; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the formation and operation of volunteer military
2 companies and volunteer military organizations. (Chapter 412 of NRS) In general,
3 existing law prohibits a group of persons other than the Nevada National Guard and
4 troops of the United States from drilling or parading with arms in any city or town
5 in this State without a license issued by the Governor. (NRS 412.604) Section 1 of
6 this bill: (1) defines the term “private paramilitary organization” to mean an
7 organized body consisting of three or more persons who associate under a structure
8 of command for the purpose of functioning or training to function in a public place
9 as a unit of combat, combat support, law enforcement or security services; and (2)
10 deems a person or group of persons to engage in paramilitary activity if the person
11 or group of persons knowingly, while acting as part of a private paramilitary
12 organization or in furtherance of any objective of a private paramilitary
13 organization, engages in certain activities.
14 Section 1 authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) investigate alleged
15 paramilitary activity; (2) issue written investigative demands in connection with
16 any such investigation; and (3) seek an injunction against a person or group of
17 persons who has engaged in or is about to engage in paramilitary activity under
18 certain circumstances. Section 1 also authorizes a person injured as a result of
19 paramilitary activity to bring a civil action for damages against a person or group of
-

20 persons who has engaged in paramilitary activity. Finally, section 1 exempts
21 certain persons and governmental entities from the provisions of this bill.

29 limitation, the filing or maintenance of a civil action for damages
30 pursuant to subsection 4.
31 4. A person who has suffered injury as a result of
32 paramilitary activity may bring a civil action against a person or

35 subsection may recover actual damages, compensatory damages,
36 attorney’s fees and costs and any other appropriate relief.
