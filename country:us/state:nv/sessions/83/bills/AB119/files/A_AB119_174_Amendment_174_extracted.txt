Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to paramilitary activity; authorizing the Attorney General to
investigate alleged paramilitary activity and issue written investigative
demands in connection with any such investigation; authorizing the
Attorney General to seek an injunction against a person or group of
persons who has engaged in or is about to engage in paramilitary
activity; creating a cause of action for a person who has suffered injury
as a result of paramilitary activity; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the formation and operation of volunteer military companies and
2 volunteer military organizations. (Chapter 412 of NRS) In general, existing law prohibits a
3 group of persons other than the Nevada National Guard and troops of the United States from
4 drilling or parading with arms in any city or town in this State without a license issued by the
5 Governor. (NRS 412.604) Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term “private paramilitary
6 organization” to mean an organized body consisting of three or more persons who associate
7 under a structure of command for the purpose of functioning or training to function in a public
8 place as a unit of combat, combat support, law enforcement or security services; and (2)
9 deems a person or group of persons to engage in paramilitary activity if the person or group of
10 persons knowingly, while acting as part of a private paramilitary organization or in
11 furtherance of any objective of a private paramilitary organization, engages in certain
12 activities [.] while armed with a dangerous weapon or deadly weapon.
13 Section 1 authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) investigate alleged paramilitary activity;
14 (2) issue written investigative demands in connection with any such investigation; and (3)
15 seek an injunction against a person or group of persons who has engaged in or is about to
16 engage in paramilitary activity under certain circumstances. Section 1 also authorizes a person
17 injured as a result of paramilitary activity to bring a civil action for damages against a person
18 or group of persons who has engaged in paramilitary activity. Finally, section 1 exempts
19 certain persons and governmental entities from the provisions of this bill.
