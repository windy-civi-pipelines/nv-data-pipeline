AN ACT relating to paramilitary activity; authorizing the Attorney
General to investigate alleged paramilitary activity and

any such investigation; authorizing the Attorney General

who has engaged in or is about to engage in paramilitary

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the formation and operation of volunteer military
2 companies and volunteer military organizations. (Chapter 412 of NRS) In general,
3 existing law prohibits a group of persons other than the Nevada National Guard and
4 troops of the United States from drilling or parading with arms in any city or town
5 in this State without a license issued by the Governor. (NRS 412.604) Section 1 of
6 this bill: (1) defines the term “private paramilitary organization” to mean an
7 organized body consisting of three or more persons who associate under a structure
8 of command for the purpose of functioning or training to function in a public place
9 as a unit of combat, combat support, law enforcement or security services; and (2)
10 deems a person or group of persons to engage in paramilitary activity if the person
11 or group of persons knowingly, while acting as part of a private paramilitary
12 organization or in furtherance of any objective of a private paramilitary
13 organization, engages in certain activities while armed with a dangerous weapon or
14 deadly weapon.
15 Section 1 authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) investigate alleged
16 paramilitary activity; (2) issue written investigative demands in connection with
17 any such investigation; and (3) seek an injunction against a person or group of
18 persons who has engaged in or is about to engage in paramilitary activity under
19 certain circumstances. Section 1 also authorizes a person injured as a result of
-

20 paramilitary activity to bring a civil action for damages against a person or group of
21 persons who has engaged in paramilitary activity. Finally, section 1 exempts
22 certain persons and governmental entities from the provisions of this bill.

30 prevent the occurrence or continuance of paramilitary activity. An
