Senate Amendment No. 676 to Senate Bill No. 63 Page 4
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-21 of this bill [enact the Nevada Youth Online Safety Act, which establishes
2 specific] establish provisions relating to the use of [social media] covered digital platforms
3 by minors who reside in this State. Section 4.5: (1) defines “covered digital platform” to
4 refer to certain online applications, Internet websites and other online products, goods
5 and services on which users may create, share and view user-generated content and
6 interact with other users; and (2) excludes from that definition certain online
7 applications, Internet websites and other online products, goods and services that are
8 used primarily for other purposes. Sections [4-11] 4.1, 4.3 and 4.7-11 define other certain
9 terms, and section 3 establishes the applicability of those definitions to [the Act.] sections 2-
10 21. Section 12 [clarifies] provides that the provisions of [this bill] sections 2-21 do not apply
11 to: (1) users of [social media] covered digital platforms who reside outside of this State; or
12 (2) [social media] covered digital platforms that do not offer services to users who are located
13 in this State.
14 [Section 13 requires a social media platform to establish an age verification system to
15 determine whether a prospective user of the platform is a minor before allowing the
16 prospective user to create an account. If the social media platform determines that a
17 prospective user is a minor, section 13 requires the social media platform to use the age
18 verification system to further determine whether the minor is less than 13 years of age.
19 Section 14 prohibits a social media platform from allowing a minor whom the age verification
20 system determines to be less than 13 years of age from using the platform.
21 Section 15 requires a social media platform to obtain affirmative consent from the
22 verified parent or legal guardian of a minor who is at least 13 years of age before allowing the
23 minor user to create an account or otherwise use the platform in most circumstances.
24 However, section 16 authorizes a social media platform to authorize a minor who is at least 13
25 years of age to create an account if the social media platform verifies that the minor has been
26 judicially emancipated. Section 15 requires a social media platform to allow a parent or legal
27 guardian to revoke his or her consent at any time. Upon such a revocation, section 15 requires
28 a social media platform to: (1) disable the account for which consent has been revoked; and
29 (2) delete all personal information related to or created in connection with the account.
30 Section 13 requires a social media platform to establish a process by which a prospective user
31 may appeal a determination of age made using the age verification system.
32 Section 17 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt regulations
33 establishing recommended practices relating to: (1) age verification systems; and (2) obtaining
34 the consent of a parent or legal guardian for a minor to use a social media platform. Section 17
35 provides that a social media platform that adheres to those recommendations is deemed to be
36 in compliance with section 13 or 15, as applicable. Section 22 of this bill: (1) requires a social
37 media platform to verify the age of each person who is a user of the platform on October 1,
38 2025; and (2) establishes a process for the social media platform to come into compliance
39 with the requirements of sections 13-16 with respect to such users.]
40 Section 18 prohibits a [social media] covered digital platform from using the personal
41 information of a minor user in an algorithmic recommendation system [.] , except to prevent
42 the covered digital platform from displaying or recommending to the minor user content
43 or advertisements relating to certain prohibited products or services.
44 Section 19 requires a social media platform to , if requested by the parent or legal
45 guardian of a minor user, disable [the following features] on the account of a minor user [:]
46 one or more of the following features: (1) infinite scrolling; (2) the display of metrics, icons
47 or emoticons which indicate certain interaction with the minor’s content; (3) auto-play video;
48 and (4) livestreaming. Section 20 [prohibits, with certain exceptions, a social media platform]
49 requires a covered digital platform to either: (1) establish reasonable safeguards to limit
50 the amount of time that minor users spend using the platform each day and the hours
51 during which notifications are sent to minor users; or (2) refrain from sending
52 notifications to a minor user during certain times of the day, which are typically reserved for
53 sleep or for school. Section 20 also requires a [social media] covered digital platform to
54 [provide a mechanism by which a verified parent or legal guardian may prevent a minor user
55 from accessing or receiving] refrain from sending such notifications [between specific hours
56 chosen] to a minor user during those times if requested by the parent or legal guardian [.]
57 of the minor user.

Senate Amendment No. 676 to Senate Bill No. 63 Page 5
58 The federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act establishes certain
59 requirements relating to the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of
60 children on the Internet. (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501 et seq.) Existing federal regulations adopted
61 pursuant to that Act require certain operators of Internet websites to: (1) establish and
62 maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of
63 personal information collected from children; and (2) obtain verifiable parental consent
64 before the operator collects, uses or discloses any personal information of a child. (16
65 C.F.R. §§ 312.5, 312.8) Sections 24-35 of this bill enact certain additional requirements
66 relating to the collection and processing of personal data collected from children on the
67 Internet by controllers. Section 27 defines “controller” to mean any person who: (1)
68 operates or provides any online service, product or feature targeted to persons in this
69 State; and (2) determines the purpose and means of processing personal data. Sections
70 25, 26 and 28-31 define certain other terms, and section 24 establishes the applicability of
71 those definitions to sections 24-35. Section 32 exempts certain entities and types of data
72 from the requirements of sections 24-35.
73 Section 33 requires a controller to, before processing personal data from a person
74 whom the controller knows to be a child, obtain verifiable consent from the parent or
75 legal guardian of the child in accordance with the federal Children’s Online Privacy
76 Protection Act. Section 33 prohibits a controller from processing the personal data of a
77 person whom the controller knows to be a child for the purposes of: (1) providing
78 targeted advertising to the child; (2) selling the personal data of the child; or (3)
79 profiling the child. Section 33 additionally prohibits a controller from processing the
80 personal data or collecting the precise geolocation data of a known child unless such
81 processing or collection, as applicable, is reasonably necessary and limited in duration to
82 enable the controller to provide the online service, product or feature. Section 33 further
83 requires a controller that collects the precise geolocation data of a known child to,
84 during all times that the controller is collecting such data, provide an indication to the
85 child that such collection is occurring. Finally, section 33 requires a controller, if the
86 controller seeks to collect the personal data of a known child with the intent to further
87 process such data, to disclose to the child the purposes of such additional processing.
88 Section 33 prohibits a controller from further processing such data for a purpose other
89 than the purpose disclosed to the child, unless that purpose is necessary for carrying out
90 and compatible with the purpose disclosed to the child.
91 Section 34 requires a controller that offers any online service, product or feature
92 that is directed at children to conduct and retain a data protection assessment for each
93 processing activity in which the controller engages. Section 34 also requires, in certain
94 circumstances, a controller to provide a data protection assessment prepared by the
95 controller to the Attorney General. Sections 34 and 36 of this bill provide for the
96 confidentiality of the information contained within a data protection assessment that is
97 provided to the Attorney General.
98 Existing law provides that a variety of actions constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS
99 100.180, 111.2397, 118A.275, 202.24935, 205.377, 226.600, 228.620, 370.695, 597.7642,
100 597.818, 597.997, 603.170, 603A.260, 603A.550, 604B.910, 676A.770; chapter 598 of NRS)
101 Existing law authorizes a court or the Director of the Department of Business and Industry to
102 impose a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation upon a person who has
103 engaged in a deceptive trade practice directed toward a minor. (NRS 598.09735) In addition,
104 existing law provides that when the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or the Director has
105 cause to believe that a person has engaged or is engaging in any deceptive trade practice, the
106 Commissioner or Director may request that the Attorney General represent him or her in
107 instituting an appropriate legal proceeding, including an application for an injunction or
108 temporary restraining order. (NRS 598.0979) Existing law requires a person who violates a
109 court order or injunction resulting from a complaint brought by the Commissioner, the
110 Director, the district attorney of any county of this State or the Attorney General to pay a civil
111 penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. Furthermore, if a court finds that a person
112 has willfully engaged in a deceptive trade practice, the person who committed the violation:
113 (1) may be required to pay an additional civil penalty not more than $15,000 for each
114 violation; and (2) is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property
115 or services lost as a result of the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 21 makes a
116 violation of [the provisions of this bill] sections 2-21 a deceptive trade practice. Section 35

Senate Amendment No. 676 to Senate Bill No. 63 Page 6
117 requires the Attorney General, upon determining that a controller has violated or is
118 violating any provision of sections 24-35, to provide the controller written notice of the
119 alleged violation. Section 35 makes it a deceptive trade practice for a controller to fail to
120 remedy a violation of sections 24-35 within 30 days after receiving written notice of the
121 violation from the Attorney General.

14 subsection.
15 6. A social media platform shall not use or retain any personal information

20 guardian of a minor user;

29 platform shall take reasonable steps to verify that the prospective minor user has
30 been judicially emancipated, including, without limitation, requiring the
31 prospective minor user to furnish documentary evidence to establish his or her
32 emancipation.

13 otherwise confidential.
14 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
15 custody or control of a public record:

19 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
20 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
