Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-21 of this bill establish provisions relating to the use of covered
2 digital platforms by minors who reside in this State. Section 4.5: (1) defines
3 “covered digital platform” to refer to certain online applications, Internet websites
4 and other online products, goods and services on which users may create, share and
-
*SB63_R1*

– 2 –
5 view user-generated content and interact with other users; and (2) excludes from
6 that definition certain online applications, Internet websites and other online
7 products, goods and services that are used primarily for other purposes. Sections
8 4.1, 4.3 and 4.7-11 define other certain terms, and section 3 establishes the
9 applicability of those definitions to sections 2-21. Section 12 provides that the
10 provisions of sections 2-21 do not apply to: (1) users of covered digital platforms
11 who reside outside of this State; or (2) covered digital platforms that do not offer
12 services to users who are located in this State.
13 Section 18 prohibits a covered digital platform from using the personal
14 information of a minor user in an algorithmic recommendation system, except to
15 prevent the covered digital platform from displaying or recommending to the minor
16 user content or advertisements relating to certain prohibited products or services.
17 Section 19 requires a social media platform to, if requested by the parent or
18 legal guardian of a minor user, disable on the account of a minor user one or more
19 of the following features: (1) infinite scrolling; (2) the display of metrics, icons or
20 emoticons which indicate certain interaction with the minor’s content; (3) auto-play
21 video; and (4) livestreaming. Section 20 requires a covered digital platform to
22 either: (1) establish reasonable safeguards to limit the amount of time that minor
23 users spend using the platform each day and the hours during which notifications
24 are sent to minor users; or (2) refrain from sending notifications to a minor user
25 during certain times of the day, which are typically reserved for sleep or for school.
26 Section 20 also requires a covered digital platform to refrain from sending such
27 notifications to a minor user during those times if requested by the parent or legal
28 guardian of the minor user.
29 The federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act establishes certain
30 requirements relating to the collection, use and disclosure of the personal
31 information of children on the Internet. (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501 et seq.) Existing federal
32 regulations adopted pursuant to that Act require certain operators of Internet
33 websites to: (1) establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the
34 confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected from
35 children; and (2) obtain verifiable parental consent before the operator collects,
36 uses or discloses any personal information of a child. (16 C.F.R. §§ 312.5, 312.8)
37 Sections 24-35 of this bill enact certain additional requirements relating to the
38 collection and processing of personal data collected from children on the Internet
39 by controllers. Section 27 defines “controller” to mean any person who: (1)
40 operates or provides any online service, product or feature targeted to persons in
41 this State; and (2) determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.
42 Sections 25, 26 and 28-31 define certain other terms, and section 24 establishes the
43 applicability of those definitions to sections 24-35. Section 32 exempts certain
44 entities and types of data from the requirements of sections 24-35.
45 Section 33 requires a controller to, before processing personal data from a
46 person whom the controller knows to be a child, obtain verifiable consent from the
47 parent or legal guardian of the child in accordance with the federal Children’s
48 Online Privacy Protection Act. Section 33 prohibits a controller from processing
49 the personal data of a person whom the controller knows to be a child for the
50 purposes of: (1) providing targeted advertising to the child; (2) selling the personal
51 data of the child; or (3) profiling the child. Section 33 additionally prohibits a
52 controller from processing the personal data or collecting the precise geolocation
53 data of a known child unless such processing or collection, as applicable, is
54 reasonably necessary and limited in duration to enable the controller to provide the
55 online service, product or feature. Section 33 further requires a controller that
56 collects the precise geolocation data of a known child to, during all times that the
57 controller is collecting such data, provide an indication to the child that such
58 collection is occurring. Finally, section 33 requires a controller, if the controller
59 seeks to collect the personal data of a known child with the intent to further process
-

– 3 –
60 such data, to disclose to the child the purposes of such additional processing.
61 Section 33 prohibits a controller from further processing such data for a purpose
62 other than the purpose disclosed to the child, unless that purpose is necessary for
63 carrying out and compatible with the purpose disclosed to the child.
64 Section 34 requires a controller that offers any online service, product or
65 feature that is directed at children to conduct and retain a data protection
66 assessment for each processing activity in which the controller engages. Section 34
67 also requires, in certain circumstances, a controller to provide a data protection
68 assessment prepared by the controller to the Attorney General. Sections 34 and 36
69 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of the information contained within a data
70 protection assessment that is provided to the Attorney General.
71 Existing law provides that a variety of actions constitute deceptive trade
72 practices. (NRS 100.180, 111.2397, 118A.275, 202.24935, 205.377, 226.600,
73 228.620, 370.695, 597.7642, 597.818, 597.997, 603.170, 603A.260, 603A.550,
74 604B.910, 676A.770; chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes a court or the
75 Director of the Department of Business and Industry to impose a civil penalty of
76 not more than $25,000 for each violation upon a person who has engaged in a
77 deceptive trade practice directed toward a minor. (NRS 598.09735) In addition,
78 existing law provides that when the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or the
79 Director has cause to believe that a person has engaged or is engaging in any
80 deceptive trade practice, the Commissioner or Director may request that the
81 Attorney General represent him or her in instituting an appropriate legal
82 proceeding, including an application for an injunction or temporary restraining
83 order. (NRS 598.0979) Existing law requires a person who violates a court order or
84 injunction resulting from a complaint brought by the Commissioner, the Director,
85 the district attorney of any county of this State or the Attorney General to pay a
86 civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. Furthermore, if a court
87 finds that a person has willfully engaged in a deceptive trade practice, the person
88 who committed the violation: (1) may be required to pay an additional civil penalty
89 not more than $15,000 for each violation; and (2) is guilty of a felony or
90 misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property or services lost as a result of
91 the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 21 makes a violation of
92 sections 2-21 a deceptive trade practice. Section 35 requires the Attorney General,
93 upon determining that a controller has violated or is violating any provision of
94 sections 24-35, to provide the controller written notice of the alleged violation.
95 Section 35 makes it a deceptive trade practice for a controller to fail to remedy a
96 violation of sections 24-35 within 30 days after receiving written notice of the
97 violation from the Attorney General.

25 within any such data protection assessment occurs as a result of
26 making any such information available or disclosing such
27 information to the Attorney General, the Office of the Attorney
28 General or any other officer or employee of the Office of the
29 Attorney General.

11 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
12 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
13 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

30 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
31 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or

36 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
37 information that is not otherwise confidential.
38 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
39 has legal custody or control of a public record:
40 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
