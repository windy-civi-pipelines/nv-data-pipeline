AN ACT relating to social media platforms; requiring each social
media platform to establish a system to verify the age of
prospective users of the platform in this State; prohibiting
a social media platform from allowing certain minors in
this State to use the social media platform; requiring a
social media platform to obtain the affirmative consent of
a parent or legal guardian before authorizing certain
minors in this State to use the social media platform;
requiring a social media platform to disable certain
features on the account of a minor user in this State;

may deliver notifications to a minor user in this State;

user in this State in an algorithmic recommendation
system; authorizing certain civil enforcement; providing

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-21 of this bill enact the Nevada Youth Online Safety Act, which
2 establishes specific provisions relating to the use of social media platforms by
3 minors who reside in this State. Sections 4-11 define certain terms, and section 3
4 establishes the applicability of those definitions to the Act. Section 12 clarifies that
5 the provisions of this bill do not apply to: (1) users of social media who reside
-
*SB63*
– 2 –
6 outside of this State; or (2) social media platforms that do not offer services to users
7 who are located in this State.
8 Section 13 requires a social media platform to establish an age verification
9 system to determine whether a prospective user of the platform is a minor before
10 allowing the prospective user to create an account. If the social media platform
11 determines that a prospective user is a minor, section 13 requires the social media
12 platform to use the age verification system to further determine whether the minor
13 is less than 13 years of age. Section 14 prohibits a social media platform from
14 allowing a minor whom the age verification system determines to be less than 13
15 years of age from using the platform.
16 Section 15 requires a social media platform to obtain affirmative consent from
17 the verified parent or legal guardian of a minor who is at least 13 years of age
18 before allowing the minor user to create an account or otherwise use the platform in
19 most circumstances. However, section 16 authorizes a social media platform to
20 authorize a minor who is at least 13 years of age to create an account if the social
21 media platform verifies that the minor has been judicially emancipated. Section 15
22 requires a social media platform to allow a parent or legal guardian to revoke his or
23 her consent at any time. Upon such a revocation, section 15 requires a social media
24 platform to: (1) disable the account for which consent has been revoked; and (2)
25 delete all personal information related to or created in connection with the account.
26 Section 13 requires a social media platform to establish a process by which a
27 prospective user may appeal a determination of age made using the age verification
28 system.
29 Section 17 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt
30 regulations establishing recommended practices relating to: (1) age verification
31 systems; and (2) obtaining the consent of a parent or legal guardian for a minor to
32 use a social media platform. Section 17 provides that a social media platform that
33 adheres to those recommendations is deemed to be in compliance with section 13
34 or 15, as applicable. Section 22 of this bill: (1) requires a social media platform to
35 verify the age of each person who is a user of the platform on October 1, 2025; and
36 (2) establishes a process for the social media platform to come into compliance
37 with the requirements of sections 13-16 with respect to such users.
38 Section 18 prohibits a social media platform from using the personal
39 information of a minor user in an algorithmic recommendation system. Section 19
40 requires a social media platform to disable the following features on the account of
41 a minor user: (1) infinite scrolling; (2) the display of metrics, icons or emoticons
42 which indicate certain interaction with the minor’s content; (3) auto-play video; and
43 (4) livestreaming. Section 20 prohibits, with certain exceptions, a social media
44 platform from sending notifications to a minor user during certain times of the day,
45 which are typically reserved for sleep or for school. Section 20 also requires a
46 social media platform to provide a mechanism by which a verified parent or legal
47 guardian may prevent a minor user from accessing or receiving such notifications
48 between specific hours chosen by the parent or legal guardian.
49 Existing law provides that a variety of actions constitute deceptive trade
50 practices. (NRS 100.180, 111.2397, 118A.275, 202.24935, 205.377, 226.600,
51 228.620, 370.695, 597.7642, 597.818, 597.997, 603.170, 603A.260, 603A.550,
52 604B.910, 676A.770; chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes a court or the
53 Director of the Department of Business and Industry to impose a civil penalty of
54 not more than $25,000 for each violation upon a person who has engaged in a
55 deceptive trade practice directed toward a minor. (NRS 598.09735) In addition,
56 existing law provides that when the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or the
57 Director has cause to believe that a person has engaged or is engaging in any
58 deceptive trade practice, the Commissioner or Director may request that the
59 Attorney General represent him or her in instituting an appropriate legal
60 proceeding, including an application for an injunction or temporary restraining
-
*SB63*
– 3 –
61 order. (NRS 598.0979) Existing law requires a person who violates a court order or
62 injunction resulting from a complaint brought by the Commissioner, the Director,
63 the district attorney of any county of this State or the Attorney General to pay a
64 civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. Furthermore, if a court
65 finds that a person has willfully engaged in a deceptive trade practice, the person
66 who committed the violation: (1) may be required to pay an additional civil penalty
67 not more than $15,000 for each violation; and (2) is guilty of a felony or
68 misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property or services lost as a result of
69 the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 21 makes a violation of the
70 provisions of this bill a deceptive trade practice.

4 accuracy rate of at least 95 percent.
5 2. If a social media platform determines that a prospective
6 user is a minor, the social media platform shall further determine,
7 using the age verification system established pursuant to
8 subsection 1, whether the prospective user is less than 13 years of
9 age.
10 3. A social media platform shall establish a process which
11 allows a prospective user to appeal a determination of the
12 prospective user’s age that is made using the age verification
13 system established pursuant to subsection 1 by submitting
14 documentation to establish the actual age of the prospective user.

24 Sec. 14. A social media platform shall not authorize a
25 prospective user to create an account or otherwise use the social
26 media platform if the social media platform knows or reasonably
27 believes the prospective user to be less than 13 years of age based
28 on a determination made by the age verification system established
29 pursuant to section 13 of this act. The provisions of this section
30 apply regardless of whether the social media platform obtains the
31 verifiable consent of the parent or legal guardian of the
32 prospective user in accordance with section 15 of this act.
33 Sec. 15. 1. Except as otherwise provided in section 16 of

2 guardianship relationship and otherwise complies with the
3 requirements of this section must not be determined to be out of
4 compliance with this section if the putative parent or legal
5 guardian is not actually the parent or legal guardian of the minor
6 user. The provisions of this subsection do not apply if the social
7 media platform allows a minor user to maintain an account after

9 guardian who provided consent pursuant to subsection 1 is not
10 actually the parent or legal guardian of the minor user.
11 3. A social media platform shall provide a parent or legal
12 guardian who provides consent pursuant to subsection 1 with the
13 ability to revoke that consent at any time.

17 minor user for whom consent was revoked; and
18 (b) Delete all personal information related to or collected in
19 connection with the account for which consent has been revoked.
20 5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a

23 identification to verify the parental or guardianship relationship
24 or to verify the provision of affirmative consent under this
25 subsection.
26 6. A social media platform shall not use or retain any
27 personal information collected under this section for any purpose

39 prospective minor user who is at least 13 years of age and who has

41 consent of the parent or legal guardian of the minor. Before
42 authorizing the creation of such an account, a social media
43 platform shall take reasonable steps to verify that the prospective
44 minor user has been judicially emancipated, including, without
-
*SB63*
– 7 –
1 limitation, requiring the prospective minor user to furnish
2 documentary evidence to establish his or her emancipation.
3 2. A social media platform shall not use or retain any

19 user is a minor with an accuracy rate of at least 95 percent as
20 required by section 13 of this act.
21 2. A social media platform shall be deemed to be in

32 prospective user is a minor with an accuracy rate of at least 95
33 percent.
34 3. A social media platform shall be deemed to be in
35 compliance with the requirements of section 15 of this act if the

(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to social media
platforms. (BDR 52-505)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to social media platforms; requiring each social
media platform to establish a system to verify the age of
prospective users of the platform in this State; prohibiting
a social media platform from allowing certain minors in
this State to use the social media platform; requiring a
social media platform to obtain the affirmative consent of
a parent or legal guardian before authorizing certain
minors in this State to use the social media platform;
requiring a social media platform to disable certain
features on the account of a minor user in this State;
restricting the times during which a social media platform
may deliver notifications to a minor user in this State;
prohibiting the use of the personal information of a minor
user in this State in an algorithmic recommendation
system; authorizing certain civil enforcement; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-21 of this bill enact the Nevada Youth Online Safety Act, which
2 establishes specific provisions relating to the use of social media platforms by
3 minors who reside in this State. Sections 4-11 define certain terms, and section 3
4 establishes the applicability of those definitions to the Act. Section 12 clarifies that
5 the provisions of this bill do not apply to: (1) users of social media who reside
-
*SB63*

– 2 –
6 outside of this State; or (2) social media platforms that do not offer services to users
7 who are located in this State.
8 Section 13 requires a social media platform to establish an age verification
9 system to determine whether a prospective user of the platform is a minor before
10 allowing the prospective user to create an account. If the social media platform
11 determines that a prospective user is a minor, section 13 requires the social media
12 platform to use the age verification system to further determine whether the minor
13 is less than 13 years of age. Section 14 prohibits a social media platform from
14 allowing a minor whom the age verification system determines to be less than 13
15 years of age from using the platform.
16 Section 15 requires a social media platform to obtain affirmative consent from
17 the verified parent or legal guardian of a minor who is at least 13 years of age
18 before allowing the minor user to create an account or otherwise use the platform in
19 most circumstances. However, section 16 authorizes a social media platform to
20 authorize a minor who is at least 13 years of age to create an account if the social
21 media platform verifies that the minor has been judicially emancipated. Section 15
22 requires a social media platform to allow a parent or legal guardian to revoke his or
23 her consent at any time. Upon such a revocation, section 15 requires a social media
24 platform to: (1) disable the account for which consent has been revoked; and (2)
25 delete all personal information related to or created in connection with the account.
26 Section 13 requires a social media platform to establish a process by which a
27 prospective user may appeal a determination of age made using the age verification
28 system.
29 Section 17 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt
30 regulations establishing recommended practices relating to: (1) age verification
31 systems; and (2) obtaining the consent of a parent or legal guardian for a minor to
32 use a social media platform. Section 17 provides that a social media platform that
33 adheres to those recommendations is deemed to be in compliance with section 13
34 or 15, as applicable. Section 22 of this bill: (1) requires a social media platform to
35 verify the age of each person who is a user of the platform on October 1, 2025; and
36 (2) establishes a process for the social media platform to come into compliance
37 with the requirements of sections 13-16 with respect to such users.
38 Section 18 prohibits a social media platform from using the personal
39 information of a minor user in an algorithmic recommendation system. Section 19
40 requires a social media platform to disable the following features on the account of
41 a minor user: (1) infinite scrolling; (2) the display of metrics, icons or emoticons
42 which indicate certain interaction with the minor’s content; (3) auto-play video; and
43 (4) livestreaming. Section 20 prohibits, with certain exceptions, a social media
44 platform from sending notifications to a minor user during certain times of the day,
45 which are typically reserved for sleep or for school. Section 20 also requires a
46 social media platform to provide a mechanism by which a verified parent or legal
47 guardian may prevent a minor user from accessing or receiving such notifications
48 between specific hours chosen by the parent or legal guardian.
49 Existing law provides that a variety of actions constitute deceptive trade
50 practices. (NRS 100.180, 111.2397, 118A.275, 202.24935, 205.377, 226.600,
51 228.620, 370.695, 597.7642, 597.818, 597.997, 603.170, 603A.260, 603A.550,
52 604B.910, 676A.770; chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes a court or the
53 Director of the Department of Business and Industry to impose a civil penalty of
54 not more than $25,000 for each violation upon a person who has engaged in a
55 deceptive trade practice directed toward a minor. (NRS 598.09735) In addition,
56 existing law provides that when the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or the
57 Director has cause to believe that a person has engaged or is engaging in any
58 deceptive trade practice, the Commissioner or Director may request that the
59 Attorney General represent him or her in instituting an appropriate legal
60 proceeding, including an application for an injunction or temporary restraining
-
*SB63*

– 3 –
61 order. (NRS 598.0979) Existing law requires a person who violates a court order or
62 injunction resulting from a complaint brought by the Commissioner, the Director,
63 the district attorney of any county of this State or the Attorney General to pay a
64 civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. Furthermore, if a court
65 finds that a person has willfully engaged in a deceptive trade practice, the person
66 who committed the violation: (1) may be required to pay an additional civil penalty
67 not more than $15,000 for each violation; and (2) is guilty of a felony or
68 misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property or services lost as a result of
69 the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 21 makes a violation of the
70 provisions of this bill a deceptive trade practice.

4 accuracy rate of at least 95 percent.
5 2. If a social media platform determines that a prospective
6 user is a minor, the social media platform shall further determine,

30 apply regardless of whether the social media platform obtains the

5 guardian is not actually the parent or legal guardian of the minor
6 user. The provisions of this subsection do not apply if the social

9 guardian who provided consent pursuant to subsection 1 is not
10 actually the parent or legal guardian of the minor user.
11 3. A social media platform shall provide a parent or legal
12 guardian who provides consent pursuant to subsection 1 with the
13 ability to revoke that consent at any time.

16 (a) Suspend, delete or otherwise disable the account of the
17 minor user for whom consent was revoked; and
18 (b) Delete all personal information related to or collected in
19 connection with the account for which consent has been revoked.
20 5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a
21 social media platform to require a prospective user or his or her

23 identification to verify the parental or guardianship relationship
24 or to verify the provision of affirmative consent under this
25 subsection.
26 6. A social media platform shall not use or retain any
27 personal information collected under this section for any purpose
28 except to:
29 (a) Verify the provision of affirmative consent by a parent or
30 legal guardian;
31 (b) Verify a parental or guardianship relationship;
32 (c) Provide confirmation of the affirmative consent to the
33 parent or legal guardian of a minor user;

39 prospective minor user who is at least 13 years of age and who has

41 consent of the parent or legal guardian of the minor. Before
42 authorizing the creation of such an account, a social media
43 platform shall take reasonable steps to verify that the prospective
44 minor user has been judicially emancipated, including, without
-
*SB63*

– 7 –
1 limitation, requiring the prospective minor user to furnish
2 documentary evidence to establish his or her emancipation.
3 2. A social media platform shall not use or retain any
4 personal information collected pursuant to this section for any
5 purpose other than to:
6 (a) Verify the emancipation status of a minor user; or
7 (b) Prove that the platform has complied with the requirements
8 of this section.
9 Sec. 17. 1. The Department of Health and Human Services
10 shall adopt regulations to establish recommended:
11 (a) Practices that a social media platform may use to:

16 (b) Criteria which a social media platform may use to
17 determine whether the age verification system established by the
18 social media platform is able to determine whether a prospective
19 user is a minor with an accuracy rate of at least 95 percent as
20 required by section 13 of this act.
21 2. A social media platform shall be deemed to be in
22 compliance with the requirements of section 13 of this act if the

25 whether a prospective user is a minor that complies with the
26 recommended practices adopted by the Department of Health and

28 subsection 1; and
29 (b) Uses the criteria adopted by the Department of Health and
30 Human Services pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 to
31 ensure that the age verification system is able to identify whether a
32 prospective user is a minor with an accuracy rate of at least 95
33 percent.
34 3. A social media platform shall be deemed to be in
35 compliance with the requirements of section 15 of this act if the
36 social media platform complies with the recommended practices
37 adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services
38 pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1 for
39 obtaining the affirmative consent of a verified parent or legal
40 guardian in accordance with section 15 of this act.
41 Sec. 18. 1. A social media platform shall not use the
42 personal information of a minor user in an algorithmic
43 recommendation system.

7 exclusively from the specific content of the specific page, forum or
8 other Internet website that a user is currently viewing at the time
9 during which the information or advertisement is being provided
10 on that page, forum or other Internet website. The term does not
11 include the recommendation of information or advertising in
12 whole or in part based on other pages, forums or other Internet
13 websites that have been viewed by a user.
14 Sec. 19. A social media platform shall disable the following

17 accompanied by any of the following features:
18 1. Infinite scrolling, including, without limitation:
19 (a) Content that continuously loads as the user scrolls down

34 Sec. 20. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a
35 social media platform shall not send notifications to a minor user:

37 zone in which the minor user is located; or
38 (b) Between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through
39 Friday, during the months of September through May, based on
40 the time zone in which the minor user is located.
41 2. A social media platform may send notification to a minor
42 user during the hours set forth in subsection 1 if the social media
43 platform obtains the affirmative consent of the verified parent or
44 legal guardian of the minor user in a manner consistent with
45 section 15 of this act to send notifications during those hours.
-
*SB63*

– 9 –
1 Such consent must be specific to sending notifications during
2 those hours and is in addition to the consent required by section
3 15 of this act.
4 3. A social media platform shall provide a mechanism by
5 which a verified parent or legal guardian of a minor user may
6 prevent the minor user from accessing or receiving notifications
7 from the social media platform between specific hours of the day,
8 as chosen by the parent or legal guardian. The default setting of
9 that mechanism must prevent the minor user from accessing or

7 by the user of such an account before November 1, 2025, and the
8 account remains suspended on that date, the social media platform
