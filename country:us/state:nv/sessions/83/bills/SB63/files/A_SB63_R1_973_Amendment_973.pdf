Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Sections 2-21 of this bill establish provisions relating to the use of covered digital
2 platforms by minors who reside in this State. Section 4.5: (1) defines “covered digital
3 platform” to refer to certain online applications, Internet websites and other online products,
4 goods and services on which users may create, share and view user-generated content and
5 interact with other users; and (2) excludes from that definition certain online applications,
6 Internet websites and other online products, goods and services that are used primarily for
7 other purposes. Sections 4.1, 4.3 and 4.7-11 define other certain terms, and section 3
8 establishes the applicability of those definitions to sections 2-21. Section 12 provides that the
9 provisions of sections 2-21 do not apply to: (1) users of covered digital platforms who reside

Assembly Amendment No. 973 to Senate Bill No. 63 First Reprint Page 4
10 outside of this State; or (2) covered digital platforms that do not offer services to users who
11 are located in this State.
12 Section 18 prohibits a covered digital platform from using the personal information of a
13 minor user in an algorithmic recommendation system, except to prevent the covered digital
14 platform from displaying or recommending to the minor user content or advertisements
15 relating to certain prohibited products or services.
16 Section 19 requires a social media platform to, if requested by the parent or legal
17 guardian of a minor user, disable on the account of a minor user one or more of the following
18 features: (1) infinite scrolling; (2) the display of metrics, icons or emoticons which indicate
19 certain interaction with the minor’s content; (3) auto-play video; and (4) livestreaming.
20 Section 20 requires a covered digital platform to either: (1) establish reasonable safeguards to
21 limit the amount of time that minor users spend using the platform each day and the hours
22 during which notifications are sent to minor users; or (2) refrain from sending notifications to
23 a minor user during certain times of the day, which are typically reserved for sleep or for
24 school. Section 20 also requires a covered digital platform to refrain from sending such
25 notifications to a minor user during those times if requested by the parent or legal guardian of
26 the minor user.]
27 The federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act establishes certain requirements
28 relating to the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of children on the
29 Internet. (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501 et seq.) Existing federal regulations adopted pursuant to that Act
30 require certain operators of Internet websites to: (1) establish and maintain reasonable
31 procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information
32 collected from children; and (2) obtain verifiable parental consent before the operator collects,
33 uses or discloses any personal information of a child. (16 C.F.R. §§ 312.5, 312.8) Sections 24-
34 35 of this bill enact certain additional requirements relating to the collection and processing of
35 personal data collected from children on the Internet by controllers. Section 27 defines
36 “controller” to mean any person who: (1) operates or provides any online service, product or
37 feature targeted to persons in this State; and (2) determines the purpose and means of
38 processing personal data. Sections [25, 26] 25-26 and [28-31] 28-31.9 define certain other
39 terms, and section 24 establishes the applicability of those definitions to sections 24-35.
40 Section 32 exempts certain entities , [and] types of data and activities from the requirements
41 of sections 24-35.
42 Section 32.5 requires a controller that is in possession of de-identified data to take
43 certain actions with respect to such data, including committing to not re-identify such
44 data and contractually obligating any person to which the controller provides such data
45 to comply with the requirements of section 32.5.
46 Section 33 requires a controller to, before processing personal data from a [person whom
47 the controller knows to be a] known child [,] or collecting the precise geolocation data of
48 such a child, obtain verifiable consent from the parent or legal guardian of the child in
49 accordance with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Section 33 prohibits a
50 controller from processing the personal data of a [person whom the controller knows to be a]
51 known child for the purposes of: (1) providing targeted advertising to the child; (2) [selling]
52 the sale of the personal data of the child; or (3) profiling the child [.] for certain purposes.
53 Section 33 additionally prohibits a controller from processing the personal data or collecting
54 the precise geolocation data of a known child unless such processing or collection, as
55 applicable, is reasonably necessary and limited in duration to enable the controller to provide
56 the online service, product or feature. Section 33 further requires a controller that collects the
57 precise geolocation data of a known child to, during all times that the controller is collecting
58 such data, provide an indication to the child that such collection is occurring. Finally, section
59 33 requires a controller, if the controller seeks to collect the personal data of a known child
60 with the intent to further process such data, to disclose to the child the purposes of such
61 additional processing. Section 33 prohibits a controller from further processing such data for a
62 purpose other than the purpose disclosed to the child, unless that purpose is necessary for
63 carrying out and compatible with the purpose disclosed to the child.
64 Section 34 requires a controller that offers any online service, product or feature that is
65 directed at children to conduct and retain a data protection assessment for each processing
66 activity in which the controller engages. Section 34 also requires, in certain circumstances, a
67 controller to provide a data protection assessment prepared by the controller to the Attorney
68 General. Sections 34 and 36 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of the information

Assembly Amendment No. 973 to Senate Bill No. 63 First Reprint Page 5
69 contained within a data protection assessment that is provided to the Attorney General.
70 Section 34 also provides that, by disclosing to the Attorney General or the Office of the
71 Attorney General a data protection assessment as required by section 34, a controller
72 does not waive certain evidentiary privileges that would otherwise be applicable to the
73 information contained within the data protection assessment.
74 Existing law provides that a variety of actions constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS
75 100.180, 111.2397, 118A.275, 202.24935, 205.377, 226.600, 228.620, 370.695, 597.7642,
76 597.818, 597.997, 603.170, 603A.260, 603A.550, 604B.910, 676A.770; chapter 598 of NRS)
77 Existing law authorizes a court or the Director of the Department of Business and Industry to
78 impose a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation upon a person who has
79 engaged in a deceptive trade practice directed toward a minor. (NRS 598.09735) In addition,
80 existing law provides that when the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or the Director has
81 cause to believe that a person has engaged or is engaging in any deceptive trade practice, the
82 Commissioner or Director may request that the Attorney General represent him or her in
83 instituting an appropriate legal proceeding, including an application for an injunction or
84 temporary restraining order. (NRS 598.0979) Existing law requires a person who violates a
85 court order or injunction resulting from a complaint brought by the Commissioner, the
86 Director, the district attorney of any county of this State or the Attorney General to pay a civil
87 penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. Furthermore, if a court finds that a person
88 has willfully engaged in a deceptive trade practice, the person who committed the violation:
89 (1) may be required to pay an additional civil penalty not more than $15,000 for each
90 violation; and (2) is guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property
91 or services lost as a result of the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) [Section 21 makes
92 a violation of sections 2-21 a deceptive trade practice.] Section 35 requires the Attorney
93 General, upon determining that a controller has violated or is violating any provision of
94 sections 24-35, to provide the controller written notice of the alleged violation. Section 35
95 makes it a deceptive trade practice for a controller to fail to remedy a violation of sections 24-
96 35 within 30 days after receiving written notice of the violation from the Attorney General.
97 Section 35 grants the Attorney General the exclusive authority to enforce the
98 requirements of sections 24-35 and further provides that those sections do not create a
99 private right of action.

27 710.159, 711.600, and section 34 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
28 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
29 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
30 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
31 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
32 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
33 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
34 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
35 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
36 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
37 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
38 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
39 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
40 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
41 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
42 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
43 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
44 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
45 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
46 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
47 record that is not otherwise confidential.
48 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
49 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
50 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
51 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
52 (a) The public record:
53 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and

Assembly Amendment No. 973 to Senate Bill No. 63 First Reprint Page 18
1 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
2 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
3 electronic medium would:
4 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
5 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
6 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
7 otherwise confidential.
8 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
9 custody or control of a public record:
10 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
11 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
12 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
13 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
14 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
15 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
16 Sec. 37. 1. A controller is not required to conduct a data protection
17 assessment pursuant to section 34 of this act for any processing activity which the
18 controller engaged in, created or generated before [October] January 1, [2025,]
19 2026, but is required to conduct a data protection assessment for any processing
20 activity which the controller engages in, creates or generates on or after [October]
21 January 1, [2025.] 2026.
22 2. As used in this section:
23 (a) “Controller” has the meaning ascribed to it in section 27 of this act.
24 (b) “Process” has the meaning ascribed to it in section 31 of this act.
25 Sec. 38. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
26 2. Sections 1 to 37, inclusive, of this act become effective:
27 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
28 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
29 out the provisions of this act; and
30 (b) On [October] January 1, [2025,] 2026, for all other purposes.
