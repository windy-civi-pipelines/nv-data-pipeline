EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Internet; establishing certain requirements
relating to de-identified data; prohibiting controllers of
online services, products or features from processing the
personal data of children for certain purposes;
establishing requirements for the collection and
processing by controllers of certain types of data
belonging to children; requiring controllers to conduct
certain assessments; authorizing certain civil
enforcement; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act establishes certain
2 requirements relating to the collection, use and disclosure of the personal
3 information of children on the Internet. (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501 et seq.) Existing federal
4 regulations adopted pursuant to that Act require certain operators of Internet
5 websites to: (1) establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the
6 confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected from
7 children; and (2) obtain verifiable parental consent before the operator collects,
8 uses or discloses any personal information of a child. (16 C.F.R. §§ 312.5, 312.8)
9 Sections 24-35 of this bill enact certain additional requirements relating to the
10 collection and processing of personal data collected from children on the Internet
11 by controllers. Section 27 defines “controller” to mean any person who: (1)
12 operates or provides any online service, product or feature targeted to persons in
13 this State; and (2) determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.

*SB63_R2*

– 2 –
14 Sections 25-26 and 28-31.9 define certain other terms, and section 24 establishes
15 the applicability of those definitions to sections 24-35. Section 32 exempts certain
16 entities, types of data and activities from the requirements of sections 24-35.
17 Section 32.5 requires a controller that is in possession of de-identified data to
18 take certain actions with respect to such data, including committing to not re-
19 identify such data and contractually obligating any person to which the controller
20 provides such data to comply with the requirements of section 32.5.
21 Section 33 requires a controller to, before processing personal data from a
22 known child or collecting the precise geolocation data of such a child, obtain
23 verifiable consent from the parent or legal guardian of the child in accordance with
24 the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Section 33 prohibits a
25 controller from processing the personal data of a known child for the purposes of:
26 (1) providing targeted advertising to the child; (2) the sale of the personal data of
27 the child; or (3) profiling the child for certain purposes. Section 33 additionally
28 prohibits a controller from processing the personal data or collecting the precise
29 geolocation data of a known child unless such processing or collection, as
30 applicable, is reasonably necessary and limited in duration to enable the controller
31 to provide the online service, product or feature. Section 33 further requires a
32 controller that collects the precise geolocation data of a known child to, during all
33 times that the controller is collecting such data, provide an indication to the child
34 that such collection is occurring. Finally, section 33 requires a controller, if the
35 controller seeks to collect the personal data of a known child with the intent to
36 further process such data, to disclose to the child the purposes of such additional
37 processing. Section 33 prohibits a controller from further processing such data for a
38 purpose other than the purpose disclosed to the child, unless that purpose is
39 necessary for carrying out and compatible with the purpose disclosed to the child.
40 Section 34 requires a controller that offers any online service, product or
41 feature that is directed at children to conduct and retain a data protection
42 assessment for each processing activity in which the controller engages. Section 34
43 also requires, in certain circumstances, a controller to provide a data protection
44 assessment prepared by the controller to the Attorney General. Sections 34 and 36
45 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of the information contained within a data
46 protection assessment that is provided to the Attorney General. Section 34 also
47 provides that, by disclosing to the Attorney General or the Office of the Attorney
48 General a data protection assessment as required by section 34, a controller does
49 not waive certain evidentiary privileges that would otherwise be applicable to the
50 information contained within the data protection assessment.
51 Existing law provides that a variety of actions constitute deceptive trade
52 practices. (NRS 100.180, 111.2397, 118A.275, 202.24935, 205.377, 226.600,
53 228.620, 370.695, 597.7642, 597.818, 597.997, 603.170, 603A.260, 603A.550,
54 604B.910, 676A.770; chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes a court or the
55 Director of the Department of Business and Industry to impose a civil penalty of
56 not more than $25,000 for each violation upon a person who has engaged in a
57 deceptive trade practice directed toward a minor. (NRS 598.09735) In addition,
58 existing law provides that when the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or the
59 Director has cause to believe that a person has engaged or is engaging in any
60 deceptive trade practice, the Commissioner or Director may request that the
61 Attorney General represent him or her in instituting an appropriate legal
62 proceeding, including an application for an injunction or temporary restraining
63 order. (NRS 598.0979) Existing law requires a person who violates a court order or
64 injunction resulting from a complaint brought by the Commissioner, the Director,
65 the district attorney of any county of this State or the Attorney General to pay a
66 civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each violation. Furthermore, if a court
67 finds that a person has willfully engaged in a deceptive trade practice, the person
68 who committed the violation: (1) may be required to pay an additional civil penalty
-
*SB63_R2*

– 3 –
69 not more than $15,000 for each violation; and (2) is guilty of a felony or
70 misdemeanor, depending on the value of the property or services lost as a result of
71 the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 35 requires the Attorney
72 General, upon determining that a controller has violated or is violating any
73 provision of sections 24-35, to provide the controller written notice of the alleged
74 violation. Section 35 makes it a deceptive trade practice for a controller to fail to
75 remedy a violation of sections 24-35 within 30 days after receiving written notice
76 of the violation from the Attorney General. Section 35 grants the Attorney General
77 the exclusive authority to enforce the requirements of sections 24-35 and further
78 provides that those sections do not create a private right of action.

23 Attorney General, the Office of the Attorney General or any other
24 officer or employee of the Office of the Attorney General pursuant
25 to subsection 4 does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
26 privilege or work product protection with respect to the
27 information contained within any such data protection
28 assessment.
29 Sec. 35. 1. Upon determining that a controller has violated
30 or is violating any provision of sections 24 to 35, inclusive, of this
31 act, the Attorney General shall provide the controller with written
32 notice that identifies the specific provision of sections 24 to 35,
33 inclusive, of this act that the Attorney General determines that the
34 controller is violating or has violated and the specific facts
35 underlying that determination.

32 (a) The public record:
33 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
34 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
35 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
36 means of an electronic medium would:
37 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
38 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
39 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
40 information that is not otherwise confidential.
41 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
42 has legal custody or control of a public record:
43 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

11 protection assessment for any processing activity which the
12 controller engages in, creates or generates on or after January 1,
