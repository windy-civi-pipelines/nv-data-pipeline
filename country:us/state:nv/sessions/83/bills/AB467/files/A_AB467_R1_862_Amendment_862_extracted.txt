EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing the creation of a facility for the
treatment of incompetent defendants within certain county jails or
detention facilities; authorizing the establishment of a program to
provide certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring a clinical review to determine the
appropriate placement of an incompetent defendant; requiring the
Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
Human Services to immediately accept placement of a child in a
division facility when a juvenile court orders such acceptance of the
child; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for a public
2 offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law also requires a court
3 to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt arises as to the competence of
4 the defendant until the question of competence is determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court
5 determines that a defendant is incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the
6 defendant into the custody of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral
7 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
8 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
9 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to enter
10 into a contract with an organization that provides mental health services to the community to
11 operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency in a county jail or detention
12 facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
13 Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the Administrator to establish a program to
14 provide services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the reintegration of such
15 defendants into society at a location other than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill
16 authorize a court to commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the
17 same circumstances where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to a
18 division facility [.] after a clinical review. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant who has
19 attained competence after being committed to a facility for the treatment of defendants to
Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 4
20 competency established in a county jail or detention facility or through a program to provide
21 services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the reintegration of such
22 defendants into society at a location other than a forensic facility to be discharged from the
23 treatment facility within the jail or detention facility or to have his or her services through the
24 program terminated, as applicable. Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of section 3 to
25 persons who have been court-martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice.
26 (NRS 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to section 3. Section
27 7 of this bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the required contents of
28 certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee concerning an
29 incompetent defendant. Section 9.5 of this bill updates a reference in conformance with
30 section 5.
31 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case before the
32 court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of Child and Family
33 Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the child. (NRS 62D.180,
34 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative officer’s designee
35 has determined that the treatment available at the facility is not appropriate or necessary for
36 the child, existing law requires the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
37 designee to assist the court with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary
38 treatment. (NRS 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services
39 to a child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
40 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the facility; and (2) if
41 the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that the child receives treatment at
42 the facility, within the capabilities of the facility, while a more suitable facility is found.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 178 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the

5 organization that provides mental health services to the community to establish
6 and operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency within the

8 if:
9 (a) Money is available to support the facility for the treatment of defendants;
10 (b) There is a qualified organization that is willing and able to operate the
11 facility for the treatment of defendants; and
12 (c) The sheriff who is responsible for the county jail or detention facility
13 consents to the establishment of the facility for the treatment of defendants within
14 the county jail or detention facility.

20 3. The Administrator may establish a program to provide services for the
21 treatment of defendants to competency and the reintegration of such defendants

26 in NRS 175.539.
Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 5

6 Sec. 5. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and dangerous to
8 himself or herself or to society and that commitment is required for a determination
9 of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain
10 competence, the judge shall order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith,
11 together with a copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
12 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s
13 designee for detention and treatment at a division facility that is secure [.] , a
14 facility for the treatment of defendants to competency established within a county
15 jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act or
16 another location to receive services through a program established pursuant to
17 subsection 3 of section 3 of this act [.] , as determined after a clinical review
18 conducted pursuant to subsection 2. The order may include the involuntary
19 administration of medication if appropriate for treatment to competency.
20 2. After the court orders a defendant into the custody of the Administrator
21 or the Administrator’s designee pursuant to subsection 1, the Administrator or
22 the Administrator’s designee shall perform a clinical review of the defendant to
23 determine whether the defendant would most appropriately be placed in a
24 division facility that is secure, a facility for the treatment of defendants to
25 competency established within a county jail or detention facility pursuant to
26 subsection 1 of section 3 of this act or another location to receive services
27 through a program established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act.
28 An organization that enters into a contract with the Administrator pursuant to
29 subsection 1 of section 3 of this act may not perform such a review.
30 3. The defendant must be held in such custody until a court orders the
31 defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for trial or judgment as
32 provided in NRS 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
33 [3.] 4. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not dangerous to
34 himself or herself or to society, and finds that commitment is not required for a
35 determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to
36 attain competence, the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator
37 or the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it might be
38 beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to
39 competency and to attain competence. The court may require the defendant to give
40 bail for any periodic appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
41 designee.
42 [4.] 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,] 6, proceedings against
43 the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or the Administrator’s
44 designee or, if the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the
45 defendant capable of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
46 provided in NRS 178.400.
47 [5.] 6. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with no
48 substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable future, and
49 released from custody or from obligations as an outpatient pursuant to paragraph
50 (d) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which
51 were suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the same
52 circumstances may be brought except upon application by the prosecuting attorney
Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 6
1 to the chief judge of the district court, or his or her designee, and with leave of the
2 court where:

4 defendant has attained competency;
5 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges again; and
6 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for commencing a
7 criminal action for the crime with which the defendant was charged, has not lapsed
8 since the date of the alleged offense.
9  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made pursuant to
10 this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less than 24 hours before the
11 hearing on the application.
12 [6.] 7. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section, the court
13 shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a form prescribed by the
14 Department of Public Safety, a record of that finding to be transmitted to the
15 Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
16 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
17 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

21 Sec. 7. NRS 178.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 178.450 1. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall keep
23 each defendant committed to custody under NRS 178.425 or 178.460 under
24 observation and shall have each defendant who has been ordered to report to the
25 Administrator as an outpatient under those sections evaluated periodically.
26 2. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall report in writing to
27 a judge of the court which committed the person and the prosecuting attorney of the
28 county or city to which the person may be returned for further court action whether,
29 in his or her opinion, upon medical consultation, the defendant is of sufficient
30 mentality to be able to understand the nature of the criminal charge against the
31 defendant and, by reason thereof, is able to aid and assist counsel in the defense
32 interposed upon the trial or against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter.
33 The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall submit such a report, in the
34 case of a person charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, within 3 months after the
35 order for commitment or treatment and evaluation as an outpatient or for
36 recommitment pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, and at
37 monthly intervals thereafter. In all other cases, the initial report must be submitted
38 within 6 months after the order and at 6-month intervals thereafter. If the opinion of
39 the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee is that the defendant is not of
40 sufficient mentality to understand the nature of the charge against the defendant and
41 assist in the defendant’s own defense, the Administrator or the Administrator’s
42 designee shall also include in the report his or her opinion whether:
43 (a) There is a substantial probability that the defendant can receive treatment to
44 competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of
45 judgment in the foreseeable future; and
46 (b) The defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or to society.
47 3. The report must contain:

4 Sec. 9. NRS 178.460 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 178.460 1. If requested by the district attorney or counsel for the defendant
6 within 10 days after the report by the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
7 is sent to them, the judge shall hold a hearing within 10 days after the request at
8 which the district attorney and the defense counsel may examine the members of
9 the treatment team on their report.
10 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist or
11 psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an additional
12 evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost of the additional evaluation
13 and report is a charge against the county.
14 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is sent, if no
15 hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a finding of competence or
16 incompetence, and if the judge finds the defendant to be incompetent:
17 (a) Whether there is substantial probability that the defendant can receive
18 treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive
19 pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable future; and
20 (b) Whether the defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or to
21 society.
22 4. If the judge finds the defendant:
23 (a) Competent, the judge shall, within 10 days, forward the finding to the
24 prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant. Upon receipt thereof, the
25 prosecuting attorney shall notify the sheriff of the county or chief of police of the
26 city that the defendant has been found competent and prearrange with the facility ,
27 if applicable, for the return of the defendant to that county or city for trial upon the
28 offense there charged or the pronouncement of judgment, as the case may be. If the
29 defendant is receiving treatment to competency through a facility located within
30 the county jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 178.425, the
31 judge shall order the defendant discharged from the facility for treatment to
32 competency within the jail or detention facility. A defendant so discharged may
33 continue to reside in a designated mental health unit of a jail or detention facility
34 to continue mental health treatment not related to treatment to competency. If the
35 defendant is receiving treatment through a program established pursuant to
36 subsection 3 of section 3 of this act, the judge shall order the termination of such
37 treatment.
38 (b) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the defendant can
39 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive
40 pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is
41 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
42 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of medication for the
43 purpose of treatment to competency.
44 (c) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the defendant can
45 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive
46 pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is
47 not dangerous to himself or herself or to society, the judge shall order that the
48 defendant remain an outpatient or be transferred to the status of an outpatient under
49 the provisions of NRS 178.425.
50 (d) Incompetent, with no substantial probability of attaining competency in the
51 foreseeable future, the judge shall order the defendant released from custody or, if
52 the defendant is an outpatient, released from any obligations as an outpatient if,
53 within 10 judicial days, the prosecuting attorney has not filed a motion pursuant to
Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 8
1 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for the involuntary
2 court-ordered admission of the person to a mental health facility pursuant to NRS
3 433A.200. After the initial 10 judicial days, the person may remain an outpatient or
4 in custody under the provisions of this chapter only as long as the motion or
5 petition is pending unless the person is committed to the custody of the
6 Administrator pursuant to NRS 178.461 or involuntarily admitted to a mental health
7 facility pursuant to chapter 433A of NRS.
8 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 7 of NRS 178.461, no
9 person who is committed under the provisions of this chapter may be held in the
10 custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee longer than the
11 longest period of incarceration provided for the crime or crimes with which the
12 person is charged or 10 years, whichever period is shorter. Upon expiration of the
13 applicable period provided in this section, subsection 4 or 7 of NRS 178.461 or
14 subsection 4 of NRS 178.463, the person must be returned to the committing court
15 for a determination as to whether or not involuntary commitment pursuant to
16 chapter 433A of NRS is required.
17 Sec. 9.5. NRS 178.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is charged with any
19 category A felony or a category B felony listed in subsection 6 are dismissed
20 pursuant to subsection [5] 6 of NRS 178.425, the prosecuting attorney may, within
21 10 judicial days after the dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to
22 determine whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator
23 pursuant to subsection 3.
24 2. If the prosecuting attorney files a motion pursuant to subsection 1, the
25 prosecuting attorney shall, not later than the date on which the prosecuting attorney
26 files the motion, request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which
27 indicates whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic
28 facility. The Division shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
29 complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40 calendar days after receipt
30 of the request and provide the comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the
31 prosecuting attorney and counsel for the person. The court may grant the Division
32 an extension to complete the comprehensive risk assessment upon a showing of
33 good cause. Within 10 judicial days after receipt of the comprehensive risk
34 assessment, the court shall hold a hearing on the motion. If the person was charged
35 with any category A felony other than murder or sexual assault or a category B
36 felony listed in subsection 6 and the comprehensive risk assessment indicates that
37 the person does not require the level of security provided by a forensic facility, the
38 court shall dismiss the motion.
39 3. At a hearing held pursuant to subsection 2, if the court finds by clear and
40 convincing evidence that the person has a mental disorder, that the person is a
41 danger to himself or herself or others and that the person’s dangerousness is such
42 that the person requires placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:
43 (a) The sheriff to take the person into protective custody and transport the
44 person to a forensic facility; and
45 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the Administrator and kept
46 under observation until the person is eligible for conditional release pursuant to
47 NRS 178.463 or until the maximum length of commitment described in subsection
48 4 or 7 has expired.
49 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the length of commitment of
50 a person pursuant to subsection 3 must not exceed 10 years, including any time that
51 the person has been on conditional release pursuant to NRS 178.463.
52 5. At least once every 12 months, the court shall review the eligibility of the
53 defendant for conditional release.

20 commitment for not more than 5 additional years.
21 8. The court may grant a motion for an extension of the length of commitment
22 pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted on the motion, the court finds by
23 clear and convincing evidence that the person is a danger to himself or herself or
24 others and that the person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires
25 placement at a forensic facility.
26 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person who is
27 committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the person does not have
28 counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the person.

36 References to the court in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of

39 However, if the person is no longer subject to this Code at a time relevant to the
40 application to the person of the relevant provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
41 inclusive, and section 3 of this act, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in
42 the county where the person is committed or otherwise may be found retains the
43 powers specified in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of this act
44 as if it were the court that ordered the commitment of the person.
45 2. When the director of a facility in which a person is hospitalized pursuant to
46 the actions taken by the convening authority having authority to convene a general
47 court-martial for that person determines that the person is able to understand the
48 nature of the proceedings against the person and to conduct or cooperate
49 intelligently in the defense of the case, the director shall promptly transmit a
50 notification of that determination to the convening authority having authority to
51 convene a general court-martial for the person, the person’s counsel and the
52 authority having custody of the person. The authority having custody of the person

5 authority having authority to convene a general court-martial for the person shall

8 Code, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in the county where the person is
9 committed or otherwise may be found may take any action within the authority of
10 that court that the court considers appropriate regarding the person.

24 2. In a case where commitment to a treatment facility was ordered by a
25 juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, [if] the administrative officer
26 or the administrative officer’s designee shall immediately accept placement of the
27 child at the treatment facility. If the administrative officer of the facility or the
28 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at the
29 facility is not [appropriate or necessary for the child’s health and welfare and for
30 the protection of the community,] best situated to treat the child, the administrative
31 officer or the administrative officer’s designee shall [assist] :
32 (a) Assist the court with identifying a facility that [has the appropriate or
33 necessary] is better situated to provide the necessary treatment [.] ; and
34 (b) Ensure that the child receives treatment at the treatment facility, within
35 the capabilities of the treatment facility, until a more suitable facility is found.
36 3. Except in a case where commitment was ordered by a juvenile court
37 pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, a child committed by court order must not
38 be released from a treatment facility until the administrative officer determines that
39 treatment in the facility is no longer beneficial to the child.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to forensic mental health.
(BDR 14-842)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing the creation of a facility for the
treatment of incompetent defendants within certain county jails or
detention facilities; authorizing the establishment of a program to
provide certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring a clinical review to determine the
appropriate placement of an incompetent defendant; requiring the
Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
Human Services to immediately accept placement of a child in a
division facility when a juvenile court orders such acceptance of the
child; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for a public
2 offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law also requires a court
3 to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt arises as to the competence of
4 the defendant until the question of competence is determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court
5 determines that a defendant is incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the
6 defendant into the custody of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral
7 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
8 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
9 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to enter
10 into a contract with an organization that provides mental health services to the community to
11 operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency in a county jail or detention
12 facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
13 Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the Administrator to establish a program to
14 provide services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the reintegration of such
15 defendants into society at a location other than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill
16 authorize a court to commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the
17 same circumstances where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to a
18 division facility [.] after a clinical review. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant who has
19 attained competence after being committed to a facility for the treatment of defendants to

Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 4
20 competency established in a county jail or detention facility or through a program to provide
21 services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the reintegration of such
22 defendants into society at a location other than a forensic facility to be discharged from the
23 treatment facility within the jail or detention facility or to have his or her services through the
24 program terminated, as applicable. Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of section 3 to
25 persons who have been court-martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice.
26 (NRS 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to section 3. Section
27 7 of this bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the required contents of
28 certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee concerning an
29 incompetent defendant. Section 9.5 of this bill updates a reference in conformance with
30 section 5.
31 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case before the
32 court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of Child and Family
33 Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the child. (NRS 62D.180,
34 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative officer’s designee
35 has determined that the treatment available at the facility is not appropriate or necessary for
36 the child, existing law requires the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
37 designee to assist the court with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary
38 treatment. (NRS 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services
39 to a child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
40 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the facility; and (2) if
41 the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that the child receives treatment at
42 the facility, within the capabilities of the facility, while a more suitable facility is found.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 178 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. (Deleted by amendment.)
4 Sec. 3. 1. The Administrator may enter into a contract with an
5 organization that provides mental health services to the community to establish
6 and operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency within the
7 county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
8 if:
9 (a) Money is available to support the facility for the treatment of defendants;
10 (b) There is a qualified organization that is willing and able to operate the
11 facility for the treatment of defendants; and
12 (c) The sheriff who is responsible for the county jail or detention facility
13 consents to the establishment of the facility for the treatment of defendants within
14 the county jail or detention facility.
15 2. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 of NRS 178.425, an
16 organization that enters into a contract pursuant to subsection 1 may serve as an
17 Administrator’s designee for the purpose of this section and NRS 178.3981 to
18 178.4715, inclusive. The Administrator retains oversight over the facility for the
19 treatment of defendants to competency and services provided at the facility.
20 3. The Administrator may establish a program to provide services for the
21 treatment of defendants to competency and the reintegration of such defendants
22 into society at a location other than a forensic facility. The services provided
23 through such a program must be developed based on considerations of public
24 safety, the needs of the defendant and the resources available to the defendant.
25 4. As used in this section, “forensic facility” has the meaning ascribed to it
26 in NRS 175.539.

Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 5
1 Sec. 4. NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 178.3981 As used in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of
3 this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS
4 178.3982 to 178.399, inclusive, have the meanings ascribed to them in those
5 sections.
6 Sec. 5. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and dangerous to
8 himself or herself or to society and that commitment is required for a determination
9 of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain
10 competence, the judge shall order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith,
11 together with a copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
12 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s
13 designee for detention and treatment at a division facility that is secure [.] , a
14 facility for the treatment of defendants to competency established within a county
15 jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act or
16 another location to receive services through a program established pursuant to
17 subsection 3 of section 3 of this act [.] , as determined after a clinical review
18 conducted pursuant to subsection 2. The order may include the involuntary
19 administration of medication if appropriate for treatment to competency.
20 2. After the court orders a defendant into the custody of the Administrator
21 or the Administrator’s designee pursuant to subsection 1, the Administrator or
22 the Administrator’s designee shall perform a clinical review of the defendant to
23 determine whether the defendant would most appropriately be placed in a
24 division facility that is secure, a facility for the treatment of defendants to
25 competency established within a county jail or detention facility pursuant to
26 subsection 1 of section 3 of this act or another location to receive services
27 through a program established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act.
28 An organization that enters into a contract with the Administrator pursuant to
29 subsection 1 of section 3 of this act may not perform such a review.
30 3. The defendant must be held in such custody until a court orders the
31 defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for trial or judgment as
32 provided in NRS 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
33 [3.] 4. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not dangerous to
34 himself or herself or to society, and finds that commitment is not required for a
35 determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to
36 attain competence, the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator
37 or the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it might be
38 beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to
39 competency and to attain competence. The court may require the defendant to give
40 bail for any periodic appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
41 designee.
42 [4.] 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,] 6, proceedings against
43 the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or the Administrator’s
44 designee or, if the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the
45 defendant capable of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
46 provided in NRS 178.400.
47 [5.] 6. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with no
48 substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable future, and
49 released from custody or from obligations as an outpatient pursuant to paragraph
50 (d) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which
51 were suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the same
52 circumstances may be brought except upon application by the prosecuting attorney

Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 6
1 to the chief judge of the district court, or his or her designee, and with leave of the
2 court where:
3 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts, that the
4 defendant has attained competency;
5 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges again; and
6 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for commencing a
7 criminal action for the crime with which the defendant was charged, has not lapsed
8 since the date of the alleged offense.
9  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made pursuant to
10 this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less than 24 hours before the
11 hearing on the application.
12 [6.] 7. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section, the court
13 shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a form prescribed by the
14 Department of Public Safety, a record of that finding to be transmitted to the
15 Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
16 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
17 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
18 [7.] 8. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal Background Check
19 System” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 179A.062.
20 Sec. 6. (Deleted by amendment.)
21 Sec. 7. NRS 178.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 178.450 1. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall keep
23 each defendant committed to custody under NRS 178.425 or 178.460 under
24 observation and shall have each defendant who has been ordered to report to the
25 Administrator as an outpatient under those sections evaluated periodically.
26 2. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall report in writing to
27 a judge of the court which committed the person and the prosecuting attorney of the
28 county or city to which the person may be returned for further court action whether,
29 in his or her opinion, upon medical consultation, the defendant is of sufficient
30 mentality to be able to understand the nature of the criminal charge against the
31 defendant and, by reason thereof, is able to aid and assist counsel in the defense
32 interposed upon the trial or against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter.
33 The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall submit such a report, in the
34 case of a person charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, within 3 months after the
35 order for commitment or treatment and evaluation as an outpatient or for
36 recommitment pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, and at
37 monthly intervals thereafter. In all other cases, the initial report must be submitted
38 within 6 months after the order and at 6-month intervals thereafter. If the opinion of
39 the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee is that the defendant is not of
40 sufficient mentality to understand the nature of the charge against the defendant and
41 assist in the defendant’s own defense, the Administrator or the Administrator’s
42 designee shall also include in the report his or her opinion whether:
43 (a) There is a substantial probability that the defendant can receive treatment to
44 competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of
45 judgment in the foreseeable future; and
46 (b) The defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or to society.
47 3. The report must contain:
48 (a) The name of the defendant and the county or city to which the defendant
49 may be returned for further court action.
50 (b) The circumstances under which the defendant was committed to the
51 custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee and the duration of
52 the defendant’s [hospitalization,] treatment to competency or the circumstances

Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 7
1 under which the defendant was ordered to report to the Administrator or the
2 Administrator’s designee as an outpatient.
3 Sec. 8. (Deleted by amendment.)
4 Sec. 9. NRS 178.460 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 178.460 1. If requested by the district attorney or counsel for the defendant
6 within 10 days after the report by the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
7 is sent to them, the judge shall hold a hearing within 10 days after the request at
8 which the district attorney and the defense counsel may examine the members of
9 the treatment team on their report.
10 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist or
11 psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an additional
12 evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost of the additional evaluation
13 and report is a charge against the county.
14 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is sent, if no
15 hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a finding of competence or
16 incompetence, and if the judge finds the defendant to be incompetent:
17 (a) Whether there is substantial probability that the defendant can receive
18 treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive
19 pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable future; and
20 (b) Whether the defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or to
21 society.
22 4. If the judge finds the defendant:
23 (a) Competent, the judge shall, within 10 days, forward the finding to the
24 prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant. Upon receipt thereof, the
25 prosecuting attorney shall notify the sheriff of the county or chief of police of the
26 city that the defendant has been found competent and prearrange with the facility ,
27 if applicable, for the return of the defendant to that county or city for trial upon the
28 offense there charged or the pronouncement of judgment, as the case may be. If the
29 defendant is receiving treatment to competency through a facility located within
30 the county jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 178.425, the
31 judge shall order the defendant discharged from the facility for treatment to
32 competency within the jail or detention facility. A defendant so discharged may
33 continue to reside in a designated mental health unit of a jail or detention facility
34 to continue mental health treatment not related to treatment to competency. If the
35 defendant is receiving treatment through a program established pursuant to
36 subsection 3 of section 3 of this act, the judge shall order the termination of such
37 treatment.
38 (b) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the defendant can
39 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive
40 pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is
41 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
42 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of medication for the
43 purpose of treatment to competency.
44 (c) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the defendant can
45 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand trial or receive
46 pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is
47 not dangerous to himself or herself or to society, the judge shall order that the
48 defendant remain an outpatient or be transferred to the status of an outpatient under
49 the provisions of NRS 178.425.
50 (d) Incompetent, with no substantial probability of attaining competency in the
51 foreseeable future, the judge shall order the defendant released from custody or, if
52 the defendant is an outpatient, released from any obligations as an outpatient if,
53 within 10 judicial days, the prosecuting attorney has not filed a motion pursuant to

Assembly Amendment No. 862 to Assembly Bill No. 467 First Reprint Page 8
1 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for the involuntary
2 court-ordered admission of the person to a mental health facility pursuant to NRS
3 433A.200. After the initial 10 judicial days, the person may remain an outpatient or
4 in custody under the provisions of this chapter only as long as the motion or
5 petition is pending unless the person is committed to the custody of the
6 Administrator pursuant to NRS 178.461 or involuntarily admitted to a mental health
7 facility pursuant to chapter 433A of NRS.
8 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 7 of NRS 178.461, no
9 person who is committed under the provisions of this chapter may be held in the
10 custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee longer than the
11 longest period of incarceration provided for the crime or crimes with which the
12 person is charged or 10 years, whichever period is shorter. Upon expiration of the
13 applicable period provided in this section, subsection 4 or 7 of NRS 178.461 or
14 subsection 4 of NRS 178.463, the person must be returned to the committing court
15 for a determination as to whether or not involuntary commitment pursuant to
16 chapter 433A of NRS is required.
17 Sec. 9.5. NRS 178.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is charged with any
19 category A felony or a category B felony listed in subsection 6 are dismissed
20 pursuant to subsection [5] 6 of NRS 178.425, the prosecuting attorney may, within
21 10 judicial days after the dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to
22 determine whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator
23 pursuant to subsection 3.
24 2. If the prosecuting attorney files a motion pursuant to subsection 1, the
25 prosecuting attorney shall, not later than the date on which the prosecuting attorney
26 files the motion, request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which
27 indicates whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic
28 facility. The Division shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
29 complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40 calendar days after receipt
30 of the request and provide the comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the
31 prosecuting attorney and counsel for the person. The court may grant the Division
32 an extension to complete the comprehensive risk assessment upon a showing of
33 good cause. Within 10 judicial days after receipt of the comprehensive risk
34 assessment, the court shall hold a hearing on the motion. If the person was charged
35 with any category A felony other than murder or sexual assault or a category B
36 felony listed in subsection 6 and the comprehensive risk assessment indicates that
37 the person does not require the level of security provided by a forensic facility, the
38 court shall dismiss the motion.
39 3. At a hearing held pursuant to subsection 2, if the court finds by clear and
40 convincing evidence that the person has a mental disorder, that the person is a
41 danger to himself or herself or others and that the person’s dangerousness is such
42 that the person requires placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:
43 (a) The sheriff to take the person into protective custody and transport the
44 person to a forensic facility; and
45 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the Administrator and kept
46 under observation until the person is eligible for conditional release pursuant to
47 NRS 178.463 or until the maximum length of commitment described in subsection
48 4 or 7 has expired.
49 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the length of commitment of
50 a person pursuant to subsection 3 must not exceed 10 years, including any time that
51 the person has been on conditional release pursuant to NRS 178.463.
52 5. At least once every 12 months, the court shall review the eligibility of the
53 defendant for conditional release.

22 pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted on the motion, the court finds by

24 others and that the person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires
25 placement at a forensic facility.
26 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person who is
27 committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the person does not have

40 application to the person of the relevant provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
41 inclusive, and section 3 of this act, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in
42 the county where the person is committed or otherwise may be found retains the
43 powers specified in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of this act
44 as if it were the court that ordered the commitment of the person.
45 2. When the director of a facility in which a person is hospitalized pursuant to
46 the actions taken by the convening authority having authority to convene a general
47 court-martial for that person determines that the person is able to understand the
48 nature of the proceedings against the person and to conduct or cooperate
49 intelligently in the defense of the case, the director shall promptly transmit a
50 notification of that determination to the convening authority having authority to
51 convene a general court-martial for the person, the person’s counsel and the
52 authority having custody of the person. The authority having custody of the person
53 may retain custody of the person for not more than 30 days after receiving

3 cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case.
4 3. Upon receipt of a notification pursuant to subsection 2, the convening
5 authority having authority to convene a general court-martial for the person shall
6 promptly take custody of the person unless the person to which the notification
7 applies is no longer subject to this Code. If the person is no longer subject to this
8 Code, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in the county where the person is
9 committed or otherwise may be found may take any action within the authority of
10 that court that the court considers appropriate regarding the person.

25 juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, [if] the administrative officer
26 or the administrative officer’s designee shall immediately accept placement of the

28 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at the
29 facility is not [appropriate or necessary for the child’s health and welfare and for
30 the protection of the community,] best situated to treat the child, the administrative
31 officer or the administrative officer’s designee shall [assist] :
32 (a) Assist the court with identifying a facility that [has the appropriate or
33 necessary] is better situated to provide the necessary treatment [.] ; and
