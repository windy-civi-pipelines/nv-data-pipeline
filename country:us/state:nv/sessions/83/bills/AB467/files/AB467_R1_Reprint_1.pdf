EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing the creation of a
facility for the treatment of incompetent defendants
within certain county jails or detention facilities;
authorizing the establishment of a program to provide
certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring the Division of Child and
Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
Services to immediately accept placement of a child in a
division facility when a juvenile court orders such
acceptance of the child; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for
2 a public offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law
3 also requires a court to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt
4 arises as to the competence of the defendant until the question of competence is
5 determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court determines that a defendant is
6 incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the defendant into the custody
7 of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
9 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
10 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator
11 to enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental health services to
12 the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency
13 in a county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or
-

– 2 –
14 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the
15 Administrator to establish a program to provide services for the treatment of
16 defendants to competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a
17 location other than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill authorize a court
18 to commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the same
19 circumstances where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to
20 a division facility. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant who has attained
21 competence after being committed to a facility for the treatment of defendants to
22 competency established in a county jail or detention facility or through a program
23 to provide services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the
24 reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other than a forensic
25 facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within the jail or detention
26 facility or to have his or her services through the program terminated, as applicable.
27 Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of section 3 to persons who have been
28 court-martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice. (NRS
29 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to section 3.
30 Section 7 of this bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the
31 required contents of certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the
32 Administrator’s designee concerning an incompetent defendant.
33 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case
34 before the court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of
35 Child and Family Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the
36 child. (NRS 62D.180, 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the
37 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at
38 the facility is not appropriate or necessary for the child, existing law requires the
39 administrative officer or the administrative officer’s designee to assist the court
40 with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary treatment. (NRS
41 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services to a
42 child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
43 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the
44 facility; and (2) if the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that
45 the child receives treatment at the facility, within the capabilities of the facility,
46 while a more suitable facility is found.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

16 safety, the needs of the defendant and the resources available to
17 the defendant.
18 4. As used in this section, “forensic facility” has the meaning
19 ascribed to it in NRS 175.539.
20 Sec. 4. NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:

24 have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
25 Sec. 5. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and
27 dangerous to himself or herself or to society and that commitment is

29 treatment to competency and to attain competence, the judge shall
30 order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together with a
31 copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
32 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the

44 178.460.

1 3. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
2 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
3 commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
4 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
5 the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
6 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
7 might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
8 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
9 The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
10 appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
11 designee.
12 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, proceedings
13 against the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or
14 the Administrator’s designee or, if the defendant is charged with a
15 misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable of standing trial
16 or opposing pronouncement of judgment as provided in
17 NRS 178.400.
18 5. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with
19 no substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable
20 future, and released from custody or from obligations as an
21 outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS
22 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were
23 suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the
24 same circumstances may be brought except upon application by the
25 prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of the district court, or his or
26 her designee, and with leave of the court where:
27 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts,
28 that the defendant has attained competency;
29 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges
30 again; and
31 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for
32 commencing a criminal action for the crime with which the
33 defendant was charged, has not lapsed since the date of the alleged
34 offense.

36 pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
37 than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.
38 6. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section,
39 the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a
40 form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a record of that
41 finding to be transmitted to the Central Repository for Nevada

43 the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
44 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check
45 System.

1 7. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal
2 Background Check System” has the meaning ascribed to it in
3 NRS 179A.062.
4 Sec. 6. (Deleted by amendment.)
5 Sec. 7. NRS 178.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 178.450 1. The Administrator or the Administrator’s
7 designee shall keep each defendant committed to custody under
8 NRS 178.425 or 178.460 under observation and shall have each
9 defendant who has been ordered to report to the Administrator as an
10 outpatient under those sections evaluated periodically.
11 2. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall
12 report in writing to a judge of the court which committed the person
13 and the prosecuting attorney of the county or city to which the
14 person may be returned for further court action whether, in his or
15 her opinion, upon medical consultation, the defendant is of
16 sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of the
17 criminal charge against the defendant and, by reason thereof, is able
18 to aid and assist counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial or
19 against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter. The
20 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall submit such a
21 report, in the case of a person charged or convicted of a
22 misdemeanor, within 3 months after the order for commitment or
23 treatment and evaluation as an outpatient or for recommitment
24 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, and at
25 monthly intervals thereafter. In all other cases, the initial report must
26 be submitted within 6 months after the order and at 6-month
27 intervals thereafter. If the opinion of the Administrator or the
28 Administrator’s designee is that the defendant is not of sufficient
29 mentality to understand the nature of the charge against the
30 defendant and assist in the defendant’s own defense, the
31 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall also include in
32 the report his or her opinion whether:
33 (a) There is a substantial probability that the defendant can
34 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand
35 trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable
36 future; and
37 (b) The defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or
38 to society.
39 3. The report must contain:
40 (a) The name of the defendant and the county or city to which
41 the defendant may be returned for further court action.

43 committed to the custody of the Administrator or the
44 Administrator’s designee and the duration of the defendant’s
45 [hospitalization,] treatment to competency or the circumstances

3 Sec. 8. (Deleted by amendment.)
4 Sec. 9. NRS 178.460 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 178.460 1. If requested by the district attorney or counsel for
6 the defendant within 10 days after the report by the Administrator or
7 the Administrator’s designee is sent to them, the judge shall hold a
8 hearing within 10 days after the request at which the district attorney
9 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
10 team on their report.
11 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
12 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
13 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
14 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
15 county.
16 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
17 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a
18 finding of competence or incompetence, and if the judge finds the
19 defendant to be incompetent:
20 (a) Whether there is substantial probability that the defendant
21 can receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to
22 stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable
23 future; and
24 (b) Whether the defendant is at that time a danger to himself or
25 herself or to society.
26 4. If the judge finds the defendant:
27 (a) Competent, the judge shall, within 10 days, forward the
28 finding to the prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant.
29 Upon receipt thereof, the prosecuting attorney shall notify the
30 sheriff of the county or chief of police of the city that the defendant
31 has been found competent and prearrange with the facility , if
32 applicable, for the return of the defendant to that county or city for
33 trial upon the offense there charged or the pronouncement of
34 judgment, as the case may be. If the defendant is receiving
35 treatment to competency through a facility located within the
36 county jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
37 178.425, the judge shall order the defendant discharged from the
38 facility for treatment to competency within the jail or detention
39 facility. A defendant so discharged may continue to reside in a
40 designated mental health unit of a jail or detention facility to
41 continue mental health treatment not related to treatment to
42 competency. If the defendant is receiving treatment through a
43 program established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this
44 act, the judge shall order the termination of such treatment.

1 (b) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
2 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
3 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
4 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is dangerous to
5 himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
6 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of
7 medication for the purpose of treatment to competency.
8 (c) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
9 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
10 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in

13 defendant remain an outpatient or be transferred to the status of an
14 outpatient under the provisions of NRS 178.425.
15 (d) Incompetent, with no substantial probability of attaining
16 competency in the foreseeable future, the judge shall order the
17 defendant released from custody or, if the defendant is an outpatient,
18 released from any obligations as an outpatient if, within 10 judicial
19 days, the prosecuting attorney has not filed a motion pursuant to
20 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for
21 the involuntary court-ordered admission of the person to a mental
22 health facility pursuant to NRS 433A.200. After the initial 10
23 judicial days, the person may remain an outpatient or in custody
24 under the provisions of this chapter only as long as the motion or
25 petition is pending unless the person is committed to the custody of
26 the Administrator pursuant to NRS 178.461 or involuntarily
27 admitted to a mental health facility pursuant to chapter 433A of
28 NRS.
29 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 7 of NRS
30 178.461, no person who is committed under the provisions of this

32 Administrator’s designee longer than the longest period of
33 incarceration provided for the crime or crimes with which the
34 person is charged or 10 years, whichever period is shorter. Upon
35 expiration of the applicable period provided in this section,
36 subsection 4 or 7 of NRS 178.461 or subsection 4 of NRS 178.463,
37 the person must be returned to the committing court for a
38 determination as to whether or not involuntary commitment
39 pursuant to chapter 433A of NRS is required.

– 8 –
1 incompetent, the provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
2 inclusive, and section 3 of this act are applicable. References to the
3 court in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of this
4 act, and to the judge of such court, shall be deemed to refer to the
5 convening authority having authority to convene a general court-
6 martial for that person. However, if the person is no longer subject
7 to this Code at a time relevant to the application to the person of the
8 relevant provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and
9 section 3 of this act, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in
10 the county where the person is committed or otherwise may be
11 found retains the powers specified in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
12 inclusive, and section 3 of this act as if it were the court that
13 ordered the commitment of the person.
14 2. When the director of a facility in which a person is
15 hospitalized pursuant to the actions taken by the convening authority
16 having authority to convene a general court-martial for that person
17 determines that the person is able to understand the nature of the
18 proceedings against the person and to conduct or cooperate
19 intelligently in the defense of the case, the director shall promptly
20 transmit a notification of that determination to the convening
21 authority having authority to convene a general court-martial for the
22 person, the person’s counsel and the authority having custody of the
23 person. The authority having custody of the person may retain
24 custody of the person for not more than 30 days after receiving
25 notification that the person has recovered to such an extent that the
26 person is able to understand the nature of the proceedings against
27 the person and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of
28 the case.
29 3. Upon receipt of a notification pursuant to subsection 2, the
30 convening authority having authority to convene a general court-
31 martial for the person shall promptly take custody of the person
32 unless the person to which the notification applies is no longer
33 subject to this Code. If the person is no longer subject to this Code,
34 the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in the county where the
35 person is committed or otherwise may be found may take any action
36 within the authority of that court that the court considers appropriate
37 regarding the person.

5 treatment facility may be only after consultation with and approval
6 by the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative
7 officer’s designee, who shall determine whether the treatment
8 available at the facility is appropriate or necessary for the child’s
9 health and welfare.
10 2. In a case where commitment to a treatment facility was
11 ordered by a juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185,
12 [if] the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
13 designee shall immediately accept placement of the child at the
14 treatment facility. If the administrative officer of the facility or the
15 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment
16 available at the facility is not [appropriate or necessary for the

18 best situated to treat the child, the administrative officer or the
19 administrative officer’s designee shall [assist] :

28 committed by court order must not be released from a treatment
29 facility until the administrative officer determines that treatment in
30 the facility is no longer beneficial to the child.
