EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; [authorizing a court to order involuntary court-
ordered admission of a defendant to a mental health facility in certain
circumstances; authorizing certain entities to request the records of
such a defendant;] authorizing the creation of a facility for the
treatment of incompetent defendants within certain county jails or
detention facilities; authorizing the establishment of a program to
provide certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring the Division of Child and Family Services
of the Department of Health and Human Services to immediately
accept placement of a child in a division facility when a juvenile court
orders such acceptance of the child; [exempting certain providers of
health care from compliance with an advance directive for psychiatric
care under certain circumstances;] and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for a public
2 offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law also requires a court
3 to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt arises as to the competence of
4 the defendant until the question of competence is determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court
5 determines that a defendant is incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the
6 defendant into the custody of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral
7 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
8 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
9 [Section 5 of this bill authorizes a court to order the involuntary court-ordered admission
10 of a defendant to a public or private mental health facility if the court: (1) finds that the
11 defendant is a danger to himself or herself or to society; (2) finds that commitment is required
12 for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competence and to attain
13 competence; (3) explores other alternative courses of treatment; and (4) receives an
14 affirmation from the public or private mental health facility that the facility will admit the
Assembly Amendment No. 227 to Assembly Bill No. 467 Page 4
15 defendant. Sections 2, 11 and 15 of this bill provide that a court that orders the involuntary
16 admission of a defendant to a mental health facility under those circumstances is not required
17 to follow the procedures established by existing law for the civil commitment of a person to a
18 public or private mental health facility. (NRS 433A.200-433A.330) Section 2 prescribes
19 certain required contents of an order for the involuntary admission of a defendant to a public
20 or private mental health facility. Section 6 of this bill requires the county or city from which a
21 defendant is sent to pay the cost of transporting the defendant to the public or private mental
22 health facility while authorizing such a city or county to seek reimbursement from certain
23 persons and entities.
24 Section 7 of this bill requires the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee to
25 provide periodic evaluations and reports to the court if the defendant is involuntarily admitted
26 to a mental health facility. Sections 2 and 16 of this bill require a mental health facility to
27 provide clinical records of the defendant to the court upon request. Sections 8 and 12 of this
28 bill authorize certain entities involved in the treatment of a defendant who is involuntarily
29 admitted to a mental health facility to request the records of the defendant from other such
30 entities to assist in the evaluation and treatment of the defendant. Section 2 prohibits the
31 transfer of a defendant who has been involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility without
32 the consent of the court that ordered the involuntary admission. Section 10 of this bill updates
33 an internal reference changed by section 5. Section 14 of this bill requires each regional
34 behavioral health policy board to track and compile data on defendants who are involuntarily
35 admitted to mental health facilities in the behavioral health region. Sections 18 and 19 of this
36 bill provide for the compensation of a mental health facility to which a defendant is
37 involuntarily admitted pursuant to section 5 in the same manner as other persons who are
38 involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities. Section 17 of this bill requires a peace
39 officer, under certain circumstances, to apprehend a defendant who is involuntarily admitted
40 to, and later escapes from, a public or private mental health facility. Section 21 of this bill
41 provides that an attending provider of health care at a mental health facility is not required to
42 comply with the advance directive for psychiatric care of a defendant who is involuntarily
43 admitted to the facility.]
44 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill [requires] authorizes the
45 Administrator to [seek to] enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental
46 health services to the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to
47 competency in a county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or
48 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the
49 Administrator to establish a program to provide services for the treatment of defendants
50 to competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other
51 than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill authorize a court to commit an
52 incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the same circumstances where the
53 court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to a division facility. Section 9 of this
54 bill requires a defendant who has attained competence after being committed to a facility for
55 the treatment of defendants to competency established in a county jail or detention facility or
56 through a program to provide services for the treatment of defendants to competency
57 and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other than a forensic
58 facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within the jail or detention facility [.] or
59 to have his or her services through the program terminated, as applicable. Section 13 of
60 this bill applies the provisions of [sections 2 and] section 3 to persons who have been court-
61 martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice. (NRS 412.196-412.584)
62 Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to [sections 2 and] section 3. Section 7 of this
63 bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the required contents of
64 certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
65 concerning an incompetent defendant.
66 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case before the
67 court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of Child and Family
68 Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the child. (NRS 62D.180,
69 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative officer’s designee
70 has determined that the treatment available at the facility is not appropriate or necessary for
71 the child, existing law requires the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
72 designee to assist the court with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary
73 treatment. (NRS 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services
Assembly Amendment No. 227 to Assembly Bill No. 467 Page 5
74 to a child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
75 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the facility; and (2) if
76 the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that the child receives treatment at
77 the facility, within the capabilities of the facility, while a more suitable facility is found.

5 psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an additional
6 evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost of the additional evaluation
7 and report is a charge against the county.
8 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is sent, if no

48 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for the involuntary

20 placement at a forensic facility.
21 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person who is
22 committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the person does not have

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; [authorizing a court to order involuntary court-
ordered admission of a defendant to a mental health facility in certain
circumstances; authorizing certain entities to request the records of
such a defendant;] authorizing the creation of a facility for the
treatment of incompetent defendants within certain county jails or
detention facilities; authorizing the establishment of a program to
provide certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring the Division of Child and Family Services
of the Department of Health and Human Services to immediately
accept placement of a child in a division facility when a juvenile court
orders such acceptance of the child; [exempting certain providers of
health care from compliance with an advance directive for psychiatric
care under certain circumstances;] and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for a public
2 offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law also requires a court
3 to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt arises as to the competence of
4 the defendant until the question of competence is determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court
5 determines that a defendant is incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the
6 defendant into the custody of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral
7 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
8 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
9 [Section 5 of this bill authorizes a court to order the involuntary court-ordered admission
10 of a defendant to a public or private mental health facility if the court: (1) finds that the
11 defendant is a danger to himself or herself or to society; (2) finds that commitment is required
12 for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competence and to attain
13 competence; (3) explores other alternative courses of treatment; and (4) receives an
14 affirmation from the public or private mental health facility that the facility will admit the

Assembly Amendment No. 227 to Assembly Bill No. 467 Page 4
15 defendant. Sections 2, 11 and 15 of this bill provide that a court that orders the involuntary
16 admission of a defendant to a mental health facility under those circumstances is not required
17 to follow the procedures established by existing law for the civil commitment of a person to a
18 public or private mental health facility. (NRS 433A.200-433A.330) Section 2 prescribes
19 certain required contents of an order for the involuntary admission of a defendant to a public
20 or private mental health facility. Section 6 of this bill requires the county or city from which a
21 defendant is sent to pay the cost of transporting the defendant to the public or private mental
22 health facility while authorizing such a city or county to seek reimbursement from certain
23 persons and entities.
24 Section 7 of this bill requires the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee to
25 provide periodic evaluations and reports to the court if the defendant is involuntarily admitted
26 to a mental health facility. Sections 2 and 16 of this bill require a mental health facility to
27 provide clinical records of the defendant to the court upon request. Sections 8 and 12 of this
28 bill authorize certain entities involved in the treatment of a defendant who is involuntarily
29 admitted to a mental health facility to request the records of the defendant from other such
30 entities to assist in the evaluation and treatment of the defendant. Section 2 prohibits the
31 transfer of a defendant who has been involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility without
32 the consent of the court that ordered the involuntary admission. Section 10 of this bill updates
33 an internal reference changed by section 5. Section 14 of this bill requires each regional
34 behavioral health policy board to track and compile data on defendants who are involuntarily
35 admitted to mental health facilities in the behavioral health region. Sections 18 and 19 of this
36 bill provide for the compensation of a mental health facility to which a defendant is
37 involuntarily admitted pursuant to section 5 in the same manner as other persons who are
38 involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities. Section 17 of this bill requires a peace
39 officer, under certain circumstances, to apprehend a defendant who is involuntarily admitted
40 to, and later escapes from, a public or private mental health facility. Section 21 of this bill
41 provides that an attending provider of health care at a mental health facility is not required to
42 comply with the advance directive for psychiatric care of a defendant who is involuntarily
43 admitted to the facility.]
44 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill [requires] authorizes the
45 Administrator to [seek to] enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental
46 health services to the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to
47 competency in a county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or
48 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the
49 Administrator to establish a program to provide services for the treatment of defendants
50 to competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other
51 than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill authorize a court to commit an
52 incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the same circumstances where the
53 court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to a division facility. Section 9 of this
54 bill requires a defendant who has attained competence after being committed to a facility for
55 the treatment of defendants to competency established in a county jail or detention facility or
56 through a program to provide services for the treatment of defendants to competency
57 and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other than a forensic
58 facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within the jail or detention facility [.] or
59 to have his or her services through the program terminated, as applicable. Section 13 of
60 this bill applies the provisions of [sections 2 and] section 3 to persons who have been court-
61 martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice. (NRS 412.196-412.584)
62 Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to [sections 2 and] section 3. Section 7 of this
63 bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the required contents of
64 certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
65 concerning an incompetent defendant.
66 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case before the
67 court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of Child and Family
68 Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the child. (NRS 62D.180,
69 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative officer’s designee
70 has determined that the treatment available at the facility is not appropriate or necessary for
71 the child, existing law requires the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
72 designee to assist the court with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary
73 treatment. (NRS 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services

Assembly Amendment No. 227 to Assembly Bill No. 467 Page 5
74 to a child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
75 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the facility; and (2) if
76 the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that the child receives treatment at
77 the facility, within the capabilities of the facility, while a more suitable facility is found.

15 through such a program must be developed based on considerations of public
16 safety, the needs of the defendant and the resources available to the defendant.
17 4. As used in this section, “forensic facility” has the meaning ascribed to it
18 in NRS 175.539.
19 Sec. 4. NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 178.3981 As used in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and [sections 2
21 and] section 3 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and
22 terms defined in NRS 178.3982 to 178.399, inclusive, have the meanings ascribed
23 to them in those sections.
24 Sec. 5. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and dangerous to
26 himself or herself or to society and that commitment is required for a determination
27 of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain
28 competence, the judge shall order [:
29 (a) Order] the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together with a copy
30 of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’ certificate, if any, into the
31 custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee for detention and
32 treatment at a division facility that is secure [.] , [or] a facility for the treatment of
33 defendants to competency established within a county jail or detention facility
34 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act [; or
35 (b) Order the involuntary court-ordered admission of a defendant to a public
36 or private mental health facility in accordance with section 2 of this act, if the

40 (2) Receives confirmation from the public or private mental health
41 facility that the facility will admit the defendant.
42 2.] or another location to receive services through a program established
43 pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act. The order [issued pursuant to
44 subsection 1] may include the involuntary administration of medication if
45 appropriate for treatment to competency.
46 2. [3.] The defendant must be held in such [the] custody [of the
47 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee or a public or private mental
48 health facility, as applicable, pursuant to subsection 1] until a court orders the
49 defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for trial or judgment as
50 provided in NRS 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
51 3. [4.] If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not dangerous to
52 himself or herself or to society, and finds that commitment is not required for a
53 determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to

Assembly Amendment No. 227 to Assembly Bill No. 467 Page 7
1 attain competence, the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator
2 or the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it might be
3 beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to
4 competency and to attain competence. The court may require the defendant to give
5 bail for any periodic appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
6 designee.
7 4. [5.] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, [6,] proceedings against
8 the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or the Administrator’s
9 designee or, if the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the
10 defendant capable of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
11 provided in NRS 178.400.
12 5. [6.] Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with no
13 substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable future, and
14 released from custody or from obligations as an outpatient pursuant to paragraph
15 (d) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which
16 were suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the same
17 circumstances may be brought except upon application by the prosecuting attorney
18 to the chief judge of the district court, or his or her designee, and with leave of the
19 court where:
20 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts, that the
21 defendant has attained competency;
22 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges again; and
23 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for commencing a
24 criminal action for the crime with which the defendant was charged, has not lapsed
25 since the date of the alleged offense.
26  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made pursuant to
27 this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less than 24 hours before the
28 hearing on the application.
29 6. [7.] If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section, the court
30 shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a form prescribed by the
31 Department of Public Safety, a record of that finding to be transmitted to the
32 Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
33 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
34 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
35 7. [8.] As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal Background Check
36 System” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 179A.062.
37 Sec. 6. [NRS 178.435 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 178.435 The expenses of the examination and of the transportation of the
39 defendant to and from the custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s
40 designee , or a public or private mental health facility, are in the first instance
41 chargeable to the county or city from which the defendant has been sent. But the
42 county or city may recover the money from the estate of the defendant, from a
43 relative legally bound to care for the defendant or from the county or city of which

36 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of medication for the
37 purpose of treatment to competency.

24 complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40 calendar days after receipt
25 of the request and provide the comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the

17 pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted on the motion, the court finds by
18 clear and convincing evidence that the person is a danger to himself or herself or
19 others and that the person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires
20 placement at a forensic facility.
21 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person who is
22 committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the person does not have
23 counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the person.] (Deleted by
