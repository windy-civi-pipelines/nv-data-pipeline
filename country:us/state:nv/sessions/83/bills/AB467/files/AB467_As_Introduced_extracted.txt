EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing a court to order
involuntary court-ordered admission of a defendant to a
mental health facility in certain circumstances;
authorizing certain entities to request the records of such a
defendant; authorizing the creation of a facility for the
treatment of incompetent defendants within certain county
jails or detention facilities; requiring the Division of Child
and Family Services of the Department of Health and
Human Services to immediately accept placement of a
child in a division facility when a juvenile court orders
such acceptance of the child; exempting certain providers
of health care from compliance with an advance directive
for psychiatric care under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for
2 a public offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law
3 also requires a court to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt
4 arises as to the competence of the defendant until the question of competence is
5 determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court determines that a defendant is
6 incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the defendant into the custody
7 of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
9 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)

10 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a court to order the involuntary court-ordered
11 admission of a defendant to a public or private mental health facility if the court:
12 (1) finds that the defendant is a danger to himself or herself or to society; (2) finds
13 that commitment is required for a determination of the defendant’s ability to
14 receive treatment to competence and to attain competence; (3) explores other
15 alternative courses of treatment; and (4) receives an affirmation from the public or
16 private mental health facility that the facility will admit the defendant. Sections 2,
17 11 and 15 of this bill provide that a court that orders the involuntary admission of a
18 defendant to a mental health facility under those circumstances is not required to
19 follow the procedures established by existing law for the civil commitment of a
20 person to a public or private mental health facility. (NRS 433A.200-433A.330)
21 Section 2 prescribes certain required contents of an order for the involuntary
22 admission of a defendant to a public or private mental health facility. Section 6 of
23 this bill requires the county or city from which a defendant is sent to pay the cost of
24 transporting the defendant to the public or private mental health facility while
25 authorizing such a city or county to seek reimbursement from certain persons and
26 entities.
27 Section 7 of this bill requires the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
28 to provide periodic evaluations and reports to the court if the defendant is
29 involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility. Sections 2 and 16 of this bill
30 require a mental health facility to provide clinical records of the defendant to the
31 court upon request. Sections 8 and 12 of this bill authorize certain entities involved
32 in the treatment of a defendant who is involuntarily admitted to a mental health
33 facility to request the records of the defendant from other such entities to assist in
34 the evaluation and treatment of the defendant. Section 2 prohibits the transfer of a
35 defendant who has been involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility without
36 the consent of the court that ordered the involuntary admission. Section 10 of this
37 bill updates an internal reference changed by section 5. Section 14 of this bill
38 requires each regional behavioral health policy board to track and compile data on
39 defendants who are involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities in the
40 behavioral health region. Sections 18 and 19 of this bill provide for the
41 compensation of a mental health facility to which a defendant is involuntarily
42 admitted pursuant to section 5 in the same manner as other persons who are
43 involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities. Section 17 of this bill requires a
44 peace officer, under certain circumstances, to apprehend a defendant who is
45 involuntarily admitted to, and later escapes from, a public or private mental health
46 facility. Section 21 of this bill provides that an attending provider of health care at
47 a mental health facility is not required to comply with the advance directive for
48 psychiatric care of a defendant who is involuntarily admitted to the facility.
49 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill requires the Administrator to
50 seek to enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental health
51 services to the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants in a
52 county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
53 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Sections 3 and 5 authorize a court to
54 commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility under the same circumstances
55 where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to a division
56 facility. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant who has attained competence
57 after being committed to a facility for the treatment of defendants established in a
58 county jail or detention facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within
59 the jail or detention facility. Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of
60 sections 2 and 3 to persons who have been court-martialed for violations of the
61 Nevada Code of Military Justice. (NRS 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill
62 applies certain definitions to sections 2 and 3.
63 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case
64 before the court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of
-
*AB467*
– 3 –
65 Child and Family Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the
66 child. (NRS 62D.180, 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the
67 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at
68 the facility is not appropriate or necessary for the child, existing law requires the
69 administrative officer or the administrative officer’s designee to assist the court
70 with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary treatment. (NRS
71 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services to a
72 child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
73 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the
74 facility; and (2) if the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that
75 the child receives treatment at the facility, within the capabilities of the facility,
76 while a more suitable facility is found.

8 sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of the
9 criminal charge against the defendant and, by reason thereof, is able
10 to aid and assist counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial or
11 against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter. The
12 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall submit such a
13 report, in the case of a person charged or convicted of a

42 designee or a public or private mental health facility may request
43 from the Department of Corrections access to any records in its
44 possession which contain information that may assist in evaluating
45 and treating a defendant who previously has served a term of
-
*AB467*
– 8 –
1 imprisonment under the supervision of the Department of

12 records, for the limited purpose of allowing the Administrator , [or]
13 the Administrator’s designee or the mental health facility, as
14 applicable, to evaluate and treat the defendant.
15 3. No oral or written consent of the defendant is required for
16 the Administrator , [or] the Administrator’s designee or a public or
17 private mental health facility to obtain access to records from the
18 Department of Corrections pursuant to this section.
19 4. As used in this section, “Medical Director” has the meaning
20 ascribed to it in NRS 209.077.
21 Sec. 9. NRS 178.460 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 178.460 1. If requested by the district attorney or counsel for
23 the defendant within 10 days after the report by the Administrator or
24 the Administrator’s designee is sent to them, the judge shall hold a
25 hearing within 10 days after the request at which the district attorney
26 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
27 team on their report.
28 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
29 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
30 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
31 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
32 county.
33 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
34 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a

40 future; and
41 (b) Whether the defendant is at that time a danger to himself or

12 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
13 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
14 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is dangerous to
15 himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
16 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of
17 medication for the purpose of treatment to competency.

23 defendant remain an outpatient or be transferred to the status of an
24 outpatient under the provisions of NRS 178.425.
25 (d) Incompetent, with no substantial probability of attaining
26 competency in the foreseeable future, the judge shall order the
27 defendant released from custody or, if the defendant is an outpatient,
28 released from any obligations as an outpatient if, within 10 judicial
29 days, the prosecuting attorney has not filed a motion pursuant to
30 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for
31 the involuntary court-ordered admission of the person to a mental
32 health facility pursuant to NRS 433A.200. After the initial 10
33 judicial days, the person may remain an outpatient or in custody
34 under the provisions of this chapter only as long as the motion or
35 petition is pending unless the person is committed to the custody of
36 the Administrator pursuant to NRS 178.461 or involuntarily
37 admitted to a mental health facility pursuant to chapter 433A of
38 NRS.
39 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 7 of NRS
40 178.461, no person who is committed under the provisions of this
41 chapter may be held in the custody of the Administrator or the
42 Administrator’s designee longer than the longest period of
43 incarceration provided for the crime or crimes with which the
44 person is charged or 10 years, whichever period is shorter. Upon
45 expiration of the applicable period provided in this section,
-
*AB467*
– 10 –
1 subsection 4 or 7 of NRS 178.461 or subsection 4 of NRS 178.463,
2 the person must be returned to the committing court for a
3 determination as to whether or not involuntary commitment
4 pursuant to chapter 433A of NRS is required.
5 Sec. 10. NRS 178.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is
7 charged with any category A felony or a category B felony listed in
8 subsection 6 are dismissed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 of NRS
9 178.425, the prosecuting attorney may, within 10 judicial days after
10 the dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
11 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator
12 pursuant to subsection 3.
13 2. If the prosecuting attorney files a motion pursuant to
14 subsection 1, the prosecuting attorney shall, not later than the date
15 on which the prosecuting attorney files the motion, request from the
16 Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates whether
17 the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic
18 facility. The Division shall, except as otherwise provided in this
19 subsection, complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40
20 calendar days after receipt of the request and provide the
21 comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the prosecuting attorney
22 and counsel for the person. The court may grant the Division an
23 extension to complete the comprehensive risk assessment upon a
24 showing of good cause. Within 10 judicial days after receipt of the
25 comprehensive risk assessment, the court shall hold a hearing on the
26 motion. If the person was charged with any category A felony other
27 than murder or sexual assault or a category B felony listed in
28 subsection 6 and the comprehensive risk assessment indicates that
29 the person does not require the level of security provided by a
30 forensic facility, the court shall dismiss the motion.
31 3. At a hearing held pursuant to subsection 2, if the court finds
32 by clear and convincing evidence that the person has a mental
33 disorder, that the person is a danger to himself or herself or others
34 and that the person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires
35 placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:
36 (a) The sheriff to take the person into protective custody and
37 transport the person to a forensic facility; and
38 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the
39 Administrator and kept under observation until the person is eligible
40 for conditional release pursuant to NRS 178.463 or until the
41 maximum length of commitment described in subsection 4 or 7 has
42 expired.
43 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the length of
44 commitment of a person pursuant to subsection 3 must not exceed
-
*AB467*

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 467–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS ROTH AND YEAGER
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
JOINT SPONSOR: SENATOR NGUYEN
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to forensic mental health.
(BDR 14-842)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing a court to order
involuntary court-ordered admission of a defendant to a
mental health facility in certain circumstances;
authorizing certain entities to request the records of such a
defendant; authorizing the creation of a facility for the
treatment of incompetent defendants within certain county
jails or detention facilities; requiring the Division of Child
and Family Services of the Department of Health and
Human Services to immediately accept placement of a
child in a division facility when a juvenile court orders
such acceptance of the child; exempting certain providers
of health care from compliance with an advance directive
for psychiatric care under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for
2 a public offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law
3 also requires a court to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt
4 arises as to the competence of the defendant until the question of competence is
5 determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court determines that a defendant is
6 incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the defendant into the custody
7 of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
9 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)

*AB467*

– 2 –
10 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a court to order the involuntary court-ordered
11 admission of a defendant to a public or private mental health facility if the court:
12 (1) finds that the defendant is a danger to himself or herself or to society; (2) finds
13 that commitment is required for a determination of the defendant’s ability to
14 receive treatment to competence and to attain competence; (3) explores other
15 alternative courses of treatment; and (4) receives an affirmation from the public or
16 private mental health facility that the facility will admit the defendant. Sections 2,
17 11 and 15 of this bill provide that a court that orders the involuntary admission of a
18 defendant to a mental health facility under those circumstances is not required to
19 follow the procedures established by existing law for the civil commitment of a
20 person to a public or private mental health facility. (NRS 433A.200-433A.330)
21 Section 2 prescribes certain required contents of an order for the involuntary
22 admission of a defendant to a public or private mental health facility. Section 6 of
23 this bill requires the county or city from which a defendant is sent to pay the cost of
24 transporting the defendant to the public or private mental health facility while
25 authorizing such a city or county to seek reimbursement from certain persons and
26 entities.
27 Section 7 of this bill requires the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
28 to provide periodic evaluations and reports to the court if the defendant is
29 involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility. Sections 2 and 16 of this bill
30 require a mental health facility to provide clinical records of the defendant to the
31 court upon request. Sections 8 and 12 of this bill authorize certain entities involved
32 in the treatment of a defendant who is involuntarily admitted to a mental health
33 facility to request the records of the defendant from other such entities to assist in
34 the evaluation and treatment of the defendant. Section 2 prohibits the transfer of a
35 defendant who has been involuntarily admitted to a mental health facility without
36 the consent of the court that ordered the involuntary admission. Section 10 of this
37 bill updates an internal reference changed by section 5. Section 14 of this bill
38 requires each regional behavioral health policy board to track and compile data on
39 defendants who are involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities in the
40 behavioral health region. Sections 18 and 19 of this bill provide for the
41 compensation of a mental health facility to which a defendant is involuntarily
42 admitted pursuant to section 5 in the same manner as other persons who are
43 involuntarily admitted to mental health facilities. Section 17 of this bill requires a
44 peace officer, under certain circumstances, to apprehend a defendant who is
45 involuntarily admitted to, and later escapes from, a public or private mental health
46 facility. Section 21 of this bill provides that an attending provider of health care at
47 a mental health facility is not required to comply with the advance directive for
48 psychiatric care of a defendant who is involuntarily admitted to the facility.
49 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill requires the Administrator to
50 seek to enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental health
51 services to the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants in a
52 county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
53 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Sections 3 and 5 authorize a court to
54 commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility under the same circumstances
55 where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to a division
56 facility. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant who has attained competence
57 after being committed to a facility for the treatment of defendants established in a
58 county jail or detention facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within
59 the jail or detention facility. Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of
60 sections 2 and 3 to persons who have been court-martialed for violations of the
61 Nevada Code of Military Justice. (NRS 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill
62 applies certain definitions to sections 2 and 3.
63 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case
64 before the court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of
-
*AB467*

– 3 –
65 Child and Family Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the
66 child. (NRS 62D.180, 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the
67 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at
68 the facility is not appropriate or necessary for the child, existing law requires the
69 administrative officer or the administrative officer’s designee to assist the court
70 with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary treatment. (NRS
71 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services to a
72 child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
73 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the
74 facility; and (2) if the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that
75 the child receives treatment at the facility, within the capabilities of the facility,
76 while a more suitable facility is found.

*AB467*

– 5 –
1 treatment to competency and to attain competence, the judge shall
2 [order] :
3 (a) Order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together
4 with a copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
5 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the
6 Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a division
7 facility that is secure [.] or a facility for the treatment of defendants
8 established within a county jail or detention facility pursuant to
9 section 3 of this act; or
10 (b) Order the involuntary court-ordered admission of a
11 defendant to a public or private mental health facility in
12 accordance with section 2 of this act, if the court additionally:

15 defendant; and
16 (2) Receives confirmation from the public or private mental
17 health facility that the facility will admit the defendant.
18 2. The order issued pursuant to subsection 1 may include the
19 involuntary administration of medication if appropriate for treatment
20 to competency.
21 [2.] 3. The defendant must be held in [such] the custody of the
22 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee or a public or
23 private mental health facility, as applicable, pursuant to
24 subsection 1 until a court orders the defendant’s release or until the
25 defendant is returned for trial or judgment as provided in NRS
26 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
27 [3.] 4. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
28 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
29 commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
30 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
31 the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
32 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
33 might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
34 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
35 The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
36 appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
37 designee.
38 [4.] 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,] 6,

41 charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable
42 of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
43 provided in NRS 178.400.
44 [5.] 6. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent,
45 with no substantial probability of attaining competency in the
-
*AB467*

– 6 –
1 foreseeable future, and released from custody or from obligations as
2 an outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS
3 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were
4 suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the
5 same circumstances may be brought except upon application by the
6 prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of the district court, or his or

8 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts,
9 that the defendant has attained competency;
10 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges
11 again; and
12 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for

17 pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
18 than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.
19 [6.] 7. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this
20 section, the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the
21 finding, on a form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a
22 record of that finding to be transmitted to the Central Repository for
23 Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
24 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each
25 appropriate database of the National Instant Criminal Background
26 Check System.
27 [7.] 8. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal
28 Background Check System” has the meaning ascribed to it in
29 NRS 179A.062.
30 Sec. 6. NRS 178.435 is hereby amended to read as follows:

35 the county or city from which the defendant has been sent. But the
36 county or city may recover the money from the estate of the
37 defendant, from a relative legally bound to care for the defendant or
38 from the county or city of which the defendant is a resident.
39 Sec. 7. NRS 178.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:

25 hearing within 10 days after the request at which the district attorney
26 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
27 team on their report.
28 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
29 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
30 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
31 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
32 county.
33 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
34 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a
35 finding of competence or incompetence, and if the judge finds the

12 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
13 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
14 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is dangerous to
15 himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
16 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of
17 medication for the purpose of treatment to competency.
18 (c) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
19 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain

23 extension to complete the comprehensive risk assessment upon a
24 showing of good cause. Within 10 judicial days after receipt of the
25 comprehensive risk assessment, the court shall hold a hearing on the
26 motion. If the person was charged with any category A felony other
27 than murder or sexual assault or a category B felony listed in
28 subsection 6 and the comprehensive risk assessment indicates that

30 forensic facility, the court shall dismiss the motion.
31 3. At a hearing held pursuant to subsection 2, if the court finds
32 by clear and convincing evidence that the person has a mental
33 disorder, that the person is a danger to himself or herself or others

35 placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:
36 (a) The sheriff to take the person into protective custody and
37 transport the person to a forensic facility; and
38 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the

29 of commitment pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted
30 on the motion, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
31 the person is a danger to himself or herself or others and that the
32 person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires placement at
33 a forensic facility.
34 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person
35 who is committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the
36 person does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
