FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing the creation of a
facility for the treatment of incompetent defendants
within certain county jails or detention facilities;
authorizing the establishment of a program to provide
certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring a clinical review to determine
the appropriate placement of an incompetent defendant;
requiring the Division of Child and Family Services of the
Department of Health and Human Services to
immediately accept placement of a child in a division
facility when a juvenile court orders such acceptance of
the child; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for
2 a public offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law
3 also requires a court to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt
4 arises as to the competence of the defendant until the question of competence is
5 determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court determines that a defendant is
6 incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the defendant into the custody
7 of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
9 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
10 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator
11 to enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental health services to
-
*AB467_R2*
– 2 –
12 the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency
13 in a county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or
14 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the
15 Administrator to establish a program to provide services for the treatment of
16 defendants to competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a
17 location other than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill authorize a court
18 to commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the same
19 circumstances where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to
20 a division facility after a clinical review. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant
21 who has attained competence after being committed to a facility for the treatment of
22 defendants to competency established in a county jail or detention facility or
23 through a program to provide services for the treatment of defendants to
24 competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other
25 than a forensic facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within the jail or
26 detention facility or to have his or her services through the program terminated, as
27 applicable. Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of section 3 to persons who
28 have been court-martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice.
29 (NRS 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to section
30 3. Section 7 of this bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the
31 required contents of certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the
32 Administrator’s designee concerning an incompetent defendant. Section 9.5 of this
33 bill updates a reference in conformance with section 5.
34 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case
35 before the court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of
36 Child and Family Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the
37 child. (NRS 62D.180, 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the
38 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at
39 the facility is not appropriate or necessary for the child, existing law requires the
40 administrative officer or the administrative officer’s designee to assist the court
41 with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary treatment. (NRS
42 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services to a
43 child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
44 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the
45 facility; and (2) if the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that
46 the child receives treatment at the facility, within the capabilities of the facility,
47 while a more suitable facility is found.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 178 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.

4 Sec. 3. 1. The Administrator may enter into a contract with
5 an organization that provides mental health services to the
6 community to establish and operate a facility for the treatment of
7 defendants to competency within the county jail or detention
8 facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more if:
9 (a) Money is available to support the facility for the treatment
10 of defendants;
-
*AB467_R2*
– 3 –
1 (b) There is a qualified organization that is willing and able to
2 operate the facility for the treatment of defendants; and
3 (c) The sheriff who is responsible for the county jail or
4 detention facility consents to the establishment of the facility for
5 the treatment of defendants within the county jail or detention
6 facility.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 of NRS
8 178.425, an organization that enters into a contract pursuant to
9 subsection 1 may serve as an Administrator’s designee for the
10 purpose of this section and NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive.
11 The Administrator retains oversight over the facility for the
12 treatment of defendants to competency and services provided at
13 the facility.
14 3. The Administrator may establish a program to provide
15 services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the
16 reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other
17 than a forensic facility. The services provided through such a
18 program must be developed based on considerations of public
19 safety, the needs of the defendant and the resources available to
20 the defendant.
21 4. As used in this section, “forensic facility” has the meaning
22 ascribed to it in NRS 175.539.
23 Sec. 4. NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 178.3981 As used in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive,
25 and section 3 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the
26 words and terms defined in NRS 178.3982 to 178.399, inclusive,
27 have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
28 Sec. 5. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and
30 dangerous to himself or herself or to society and that commitment is
31 required for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive
32 treatment to competency and to attain competence, the judge shall
33 order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together with a
34 copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
35 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the
36 Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a division
37 facility that is secure [.] , a facility for the treatment of defendants
38 to competency established within a county jail or detention facility
39 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act or another
40 location to receive services through a program established
41 pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act, as determined
42 after a clinical review conducted pursuant to subsection 2. The
43 order may include the involuntary administration of medication if
44 appropriate for treatment to competency.

– 4 –
1 2. After the court orders a defendant into the custody of the
2 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee pursuant to
3 subsection 1, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
4 shall perform a clinical review of the defendant to determine
5 whether the defendant would most appropriately be placed in a
6 division facility that is secure, a facility for the treatment of
7 defendants to competency established within a county jail or
8 detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act
9 or another location to receive services through a program
10 established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act. An
11 organization that enters into a contract with the Administrator
12 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act may not perform
13 such a review.
14 3. The defendant must be held in such custody until a court
15 orders the defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for
16 trial or judgment as provided in NRS 178.450, 178.455 and
17 178.460.
18 [3.] 4. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
19 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
20 commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
21 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
22 the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
23 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
24 might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
25 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
26 The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
27 appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
28 designee.
29 [4.] 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,] 6,
30 proceedings against the defendant must be suspended until the
31 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee or, if the defendant is
32 charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable
33 of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
34 provided in NRS 178.400.
35 [5.] 6. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent,
36 with no substantial probability of attaining competency in the
37 foreseeable future, and released from custody or from obligations as
38 an outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS
39 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were
40 suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the
41 same circumstances may be brought except upon application by the
42 prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of the district court, or his or
43 her designee, and with leave of the court where:
44 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts,
45 that the defendant has attained competency;
-
*AB467_R2*
– 5 –
1 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges
2 again; and
3 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for
4 commencing a criminal action for the crime with which the
5 defendant was charged, has not lapsed since the date of the alleged
6 offense.
7  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made
8 pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
9 than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.
10 [6.] 7. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this
11 section, the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the
12 finding, on a form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a
13 record of that finding to be transmitted to the Central Repository for
14 Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
15 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each
16 appropriate database of the National Instant Criminal Background
17 Check System.
18 [7.] 8. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal
19 Background Check System” has the meaning ascribed to it in
20 NRS 179A.062.
21 Sec. 6. (Deleted by amendment.)
22 Sec. 7. NRS 178.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 178.450 1. The Administrator or the Administrator’s
24 designee shall keep each defendant committed to custody under
25 NRS 178.425 or 178.460 under observation and shall have each
26 defendant who has been ordered to report to the Administrator as an
27 outpatient under those sections evaluated periodically.
28 2. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall
29 report in writing to a judge of the court which committed the person
30 and the prosecuting attorney of the county or city to which the
31 person may be returned for further court action whether, in his or
32 her opinion, upon medical consultation, the defendant is of
33 sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of the
34 criminal charge against the defendant and, by reason thereof, is able
35 to aid and assist counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial or
36 against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter. The
37 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall submit such a
38 report, in the case of a person charged or convicted of a
39 misdemeanor, within 3 months after the order for commitment or
40 treatment and evaluation as an outpatient or for recommitment
41 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, and at
42 monthly intervals thereafter. In all other cases, the initial report must
43 be submitted within 6 months after the order and at 6-month
44 intervals thereafter. If the opinion of the Administrator or the
45 Administrator’s designee is that the defendant is not of sufficient
-
*AB467_R2*
– 6 –
1 mentality to understand the nature of the charge against the
2 defendant and assist in the defendant’s own defense, the
3 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall also include in
4 the report his or her opinion whether:
5 (a) There is a substantial probability that the defendant can
6 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand
7 trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable
8 future; and
9 (b) The defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or
10 to society.
11 3. The report must contain:

13 the defendant may be returned for further court action.
14 (b) The circumstances under which the defendant was
15 committed to the custody of the Administrator or the
16 Administrator’s designee and the duration of the defendant’s
17 [hospitalization,] treatment to competency or the circumstances
18 under which the defendant was ordered to report to the
19 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient.
20 Sec. 8. (Deleted by amendment.)
21 Sec. 9. NRS 178.460 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 178.460 1. If requested by the district attorney or counsel for
23 the defendant within 10 days after the report by the Administrator or
24 the Administrator’s designee is sent to them, the judge shall hold a
25 hearing within 10 days after the request at which the district attorney
26 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
27 team on their report.
28 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
29 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
30 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
31 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
32 county.
33 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
34 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a
35 finding of competence or incompetence, and if the judge finds the
36 defendant to be incompetent:
37 (a) Whether there is substantial probability that the defendant
38 can receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to
39 stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable
40 future; and
41 (b) Whether the defendant is at that time a danger to himself or
42 herself or to society.
43 4. If the judge finds the defendant:
44 (a) Competent, the judge shall, within 10 days, forward the
45 finding to the prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant.
-
*AB467_R2*
– 7 –
1 Upon receipt thereof, the prosecuting attorney shall notify the
2 sheriff of the county or chief of police of the city that the defendant
3 has been found competent and prearrange with the facility , if
4 applicable, for the return of the defendant to that county or city for
5 trial upon the offense there charged or the pronouncement of
6 judgment, as the case may be. If the defendant is receiving
7 treatment to competency through a facility located within the
8 county jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
9 178.425, the judge shall order the defendant discharged from the
10 facility for treatment to competency within the jail or detention
11 facility. A defendant so discharged may continue to reside in a
12 designated mental health unit of a jail or detention facility to
13 continue mental health treatment not related to treatment to
14 competency. If the defendant is receiving treatment through a
15 program established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this
16 act, the judge shall order the termination of such treatment.
17 (b) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
18 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
19 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
20 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is dangerous to
21 himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
22 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of
23 medication for the purpose of treatment to competency.
24 (c) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
25 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
26 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
27 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is not dangerous
28 to himself or herself or to society, the judge shall order that the
29 defendant remain an outpatient or be transferred to the status of an
30 outpatient under the provisions of NRS 178.425.
31 (d) Incompetent, with no substantial probability of attaining
32 competency in the foreseeable future, the judge shall order the
33 defendant released from custody or, if the defendant is an outpatient,
34 released from any obligations as an outpatient if, within 10 judicial
35 days, the prosecuting attorney has not filed a motion pursuant to
36 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for
37 the involuntary court-ordered admission of the person to a mental
38 health facility pursuant to NRS 433A.200. After the initial 10
39 judicial days, the person may remain an outpatient or in custody
40 under the provisions of this chapter only as long as the motion or
41 petition is pending unless the person is committed to the custody of
42 the Administrator pursuant to NRS 178.461 or involuntarily
43 admitted to a mental health facility pursuant to chapter 433A of
44 NRS.

1 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 7 of NRS
2 178.461, no person who is committed under the provisions of this
3 chapter may be held in the custody of the Administrator or the
4 Administrator’s designee longer than the longest period of
5 incarceration provided for the crime or crimes with which the
6 person is charged or 10 years, whichever period is shorter. Upon
7 expiration of the applicable period provided in this section,
8 subsection 4 or 7 of NRS 178.461 or subsection 4 of NRS 178.463,
9 the person must be returned to the committing court for a
10 determination as to whether or not involuntary commitment
11 pursuant to chapter 433A of NRS is required.
12 Sec. 9.5. NRS 178.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is
14 charged with any category A felony or a category B felony listed in
15 subsection 6 are dismissed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 of NRS
16 178.425, the prosecuting attorney may, within 10 judicial days after
17 the dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
18 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator
19 pursuant to subsection 3.
20 2. If the prosecuting attorney files a motion pursuant to
21 subsection 1, the prosecuting attorney shall, not later than the date
22 on which the prosecuting attorney files the motion, request from the
23 Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates whether
24 the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic
25 facility. The Division shall, except as otherwise provided in this
26 subsection, complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40
27 calendar days after receipt of the request and provide the
28 comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the prosecuting attorney
29 and counsel for the person. The court may grant the Division an
30 extension to complete the comprehensive risk assessment upon a
31 showing of good cause. Within 10 judicial days after receipt of the
32 comprehensive risk assessment, the court shall hold a hearing on the
33 motion. If the person was charged with any category A felony other
34 than murder or sexual assault or a category B felony listed in
35 subsection 6 and the comprehensive risk assessment indicates that
36 the person does not require the level of security provided by a
37 forensic facility, the court shall dismiss the motion.
38 3. At a hearing held pursuant to subsection 2, if the court finds
39 by clear and convincing evidence that the person has a mental
40 disorder, that the person is a danger to himself or herself or others
41 and that the person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires
42 placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:
43 (a) The sheriff to take the person into protective custody and
44 transport the person to a forensic facility; and
-
*AB467_R2*
– 9 –
1 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the
2 Administrator and kept under observation until the person is eligible
3 for conditional release pursuant to NRS 178.463 or until the
4 maximum length of commitment described in subsection 4 or 7 has
5 expired.
6 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the length of
7 commitment of a person pursuant to subsection 3 must not exceed
8 10 years, including any time that the person has been on conditional
9 release pursuant to NRS 178.463.
10 5. At least once every 12 months, the court shall review the
11 eligibility of the defendant for conditional release.
12 6. The provisions of subsection 1 apply to any of the following
13 category B felonies:
14 (a) Voluntary manslaughter pursuant to NRS 200.050;

27 7. If a person is within 6 months of the maximum length of
28 commitment set forth in this subsection or subsection 4, as
29 applicable, and:
30 (a) Was charged with murder or sexual assault; and
31 (b) Was committed to the custody of the Administrator pursuant
32 to this subsection or subsection 3,
33  the Administrator may file a motion to request an extension of
34 the length of commitment for not more than 5 additional years.
35 8. The court may grant a motion for an extension of the length
36 of commitment pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted
37 on the motion, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
38 the person is a danger to himself or herself or others and that the
39 person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires placement at
40 a forensic facility.
41 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person
42 who is committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the
43 person does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
44 represent the person.

3 Sec. 13. NRS 412.4485 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 412.4485 1. Unless otherwise stated in this section, in the
5 case of a person determined pursuant to NRS 412.2645 to be
6 incompetent, the provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
7 inclusive, and section 3 of this act are applicable. References to the
8 court in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of this
9 act, and to the judge of such court, shall be deemed to refer to the
10 convening authority having authority to convene a general court-
11 martial for that person. However, if the person is no longer subject
12 to this Code at a time relevant to the application to the person of the
13 relevant provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and
14 section 3 of this act, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in
15 the county where the person is committed or otherwise may be
16 found retains the powers specified in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
17 inclusive, and section 3 of this act as if it were the court that
18 ordered the commitment of the person.
19 2. When the director of a facility in which a person is
20 hospitalized pursuant to the actions taken by the convening authority
21 having authority to convene a general court-martial for that person
22 determines that the person is able to understand the nature of the
23 proceedings against the person and to conduct or cooperate
24 intelligently in the defense of the case, the director shall promptly
25 transmit a notification of that determination to the convening
26 authority having authority to convene a general court-martial for the
27 person, the person’s counsel and the authority having custody of the
28 person. The authority having custody of the person may retain
29 custody of the person for not more than 30 days after receiving
30 notification that the person has recovered to such an extent that the
31 person is able to understand the nature of the proceedings against
32 the person and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of
33 the case.
34 3. Upon receipt of a notification pursuant to subsection 2, the
35 convening authority having authority to convene a general court-
36 martial for the person shall promptly take custody of the person
37 unless the person to which the notification applies is no longer
38 subject to this Code. If the person is no longer subject to this Code,
39 the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in the county where the
40 person is committed or otherwise may be found may take any action
41 within the authority of that court that the court considers appropriate
42 regarding the person.

5 433B.320 1. In any case involving commitment by court
6 order, except a case where commitment was ordered by a juvenile
7 court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, admission to a
8 treatment facility may be only after consultation with and approval
9 by the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative
10 officer’s designee, who shall determine whether the treatment
11 available at the facility is appropriate or necessary for the child’s
12 health and welfare.
13 2. In a case where commitment to a treatment facility was
14 ordered by a juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185,
15 [if] the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
16 designee shall immediately accept placement of the child at the
17 treatment facility. If the administrative officer of the facility or the
18 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment
19 available at the facility is not [appropriate or necessary for the
20 child’s health and welfare and for the protection of the community,]
21 best situated to treat the child, the administrative officer or the
22 administrative officer’s designee shall [assist] :
23 (a) Assist the court with identifying a facility that [has the
24 appropriate or necessary] is better situated to provide the necessary
25 treatment [.] ; and
26 (b) Ensure that the child receives treatment at the treatment
27 facility, within the capabilities of the treatment facility, until a
28 more suitable facility is found.
29 3. Except in a case where commitment was ordered by a
30 juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, a child
31 committed by court order must not be released from a treatment
32 facility until the administrative officer determines that treatment in
33 the facility is no longer beneficial to the child.

36 effective upon passage and approval.

SECOND REPRINT A.B. 467
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 467–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS ROTH AND YEAGER
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
JOINT SPONSOR: SENATOR NGUYEN
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to forensic mental health.
(BDR 14-842)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; authorizing the creation of a
facility for the treatment of incompetent defendants
within certain county jails or detention facilities;
authorizing the establishment of a program to provide
certain services to an incompetent defendant outside of a
forensic facility; requiring a clinical review to determine
the appropriate placement of an incompetent defendant;
requiring the Division of Child and Family Services of the
Department of Health and Human Services to
immediately accept placement of a child in a division
facility when a juvenile court orders such acceptance of
the child; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a defendant from being tried or judgment pronounced for
2 a public offense while the defendant is incompetent. (NRS 178.400) Existing law
3 also requires a court to suspend criminal proceedings against a defendant if doubt
4 arises as to the competence of the defendant until the question of competence is
5 determined. (NRS 178.405) After a court determines that a defendant is
6 incompetent, existing law requires a judge to order the defendant into the custody
7 of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for
9 treatment at a secure mental health facility of the Division. (NRS 178.425)
10 Under certain circumstances, section 3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator
11 to enter into a contract with an organization that provides mental health services to
-
*AB467_R2*

– 2 –
12 the community to operate a facility for the treatment of defendants to competency
13 in a county jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or
14 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 3 additionally authorizes the
15 Administrator to establish a program to provide services for the treatment of
16 defendants to competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a
17 location other than a forensic facility. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill authorize a court
18 to commit an incompetent defendant to such a facility or program under the same
19 circumstances where the court is authorized to commit an incompetent defendant to
20 a division facility after a clinical review. Section 9 of this bill requires a defendant
21 who has attained competence after being committed to a facility for the treatment of
22 defendants to competency established in a county jail or detention facility or
23 through a program to provide services for the treatment of defendants to
24 competency and the reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other
25 than a forensic facility to be discharged from the treatment facility within the jail or
26 detention facility or to have his or her services through the program terminated, as
27 applicable. Section 13 of this bill applies the provisions of section 3 to persons who
28 have been court-martialed for violations of the Nevada Code of Military Justice.
29 (NRS 412.196-412.584) Section 4 of this bill applies certain definitions to section
30 3. Section 7 of this bill revises certain terminology to more accurately reflect the
31 required contents of certain periodic reports of the Administrator or the
32 Administrator’s designee concerning an incompetent defendant. Section 9.5 of this
33 bill updates a reference in conformance with section 5.
34 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court that determines that a child in a case
35 before the court is incompetent to require a treatment facility of the Division of
36 Child and Family Services of the Department to accept and provide services to the
37 child. (NRS 62D.180, 62D.185) If the administrative officer of the facility or the
38 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment available at
39 the facility is not appropriate or necessary for the child, existing law requires the
40 administrative officer or the administrative officer’s designee to assist the court
41 with identifying a facility that has the appropriate or necessary treatment. (NRS
42 433B.320) If a court orders a treatment facility to accept and provide services to a
43 child, section 20 of this bill requires the administrative officer of the facility or the
44 administrative officer’s designee to: (1) accept placement of the child in the
45 facility; and (2) if the facility is not best situated to treat the child, to ensure that
46 the child receives treatment at the facility, within the capabilities of the facility,
47 while a more suitable facility is found.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 178 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. (Deleted by amendment.)
4 Sec. 3. 1. The Administrator may enter into a contract with
5 an organization that provides mental health services to the
6 community to establish and operate a facility for the treatment of
7 defendants to competency within the county jail or detention
8 facility in a county whose population is 100,000 or more if:
9 (a) Money is available to support the facility for the treatment
10 of defendants;
-
*AB467_R2*

– 3 –
1 (b) There is a qualified organization that is willing and able to
2 operate the facility for the treatment of defendants; and
3 (c) The sheriff who is responsible for the county jail or
4 detention facility consents to the establishment of the facility for
5 the treatment of defendants within the county jail or detention
6 facility.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 of NRS
8 178.425, an organization that enters into a contract pursuant to
9 subsection 1 may serve as an Administrator’s designee for the
10 purpose of this section and NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive.
11 The Administrator retains oversight over the facility for the
12 treatment of defendants to competency and services provided at
13 the facility.
14 3. The Administrator may establish a program to provide
15 services for the treatment of defendants to competency and the
16 reintegration of such defendants into society at a location other
17 than a forensic facility. The services provided through such a
18 program must be developed based on considerations of public
19 safety, the needs of the defendant and the resources available to
20 the defendant.
21 4. As used in this section, “forensic facility” has the meaning
22 ascribed to it in NRS 175.539.
23 Sec. 4. NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 178.3981 As used in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive,
25 and section 3 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the
26 words and terms defined in NRS 178.3982 to 178.399, inclusive,
27 have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
28 Sec. 5. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and
30 dangerous to himself or herself or to society and that commitment is
31 required for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive
32 treatment to competency and to attain competence, the judge shall
33 order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together with a
34 copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
35 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the
36 Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a division
37 facility that is secure [.] , a facility for the treatment of defendants
38 to competency established within a county jail or detention facility
39 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act or another
40 location to receive services through a program established
41 pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act, as determined
42 after a clinical review conducted pursuant to subsection 2. The
43 order may include the involuntary administration of medication if
44 appropriate for treatment to competency.
-
*AB467_R2*

– 4 –
1 2. After the court orders a defendant into the custody of the
2 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee pursuant to
3 subsection 1, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
4 shall perform a clinical review of the defendant to determine
5 whether the defendant would most appropriately be placed in a
6 division facility that is secure, a facility for the treatment of
7 defendants to competency established within a county jail or
8 detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act
9 or another location to receive services through a program
10 established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this act. An
11 organization that enters into a contract with the Administrator
12 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 3 of this act may not perform
13 such a review.
14 3. The defendant must be held in such custody until a court
15 orders the defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for
16 trial or judgment as provided in NRS 178.450, 178.455 and
17 178.460.
18 [3.] 4. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
19 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
20 commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
21 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
22 the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
23 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
24 might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
25 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
26 The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
27 appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
28 designee.
29 [4.] 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,] 6,
30 proceedings against the defendant must be suspended until the
31 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee or, if the defendant is
32 charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable
33 of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
34 provided in NRS 178.400.
35 [5.] 6. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent,
36 with no substantial probability of attaining competency in the
37 foreseeable future, and released from custody or from obligations as
38 an outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS
39 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were
40 suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the
41 same circumstances may be brought except upon application by the
42 prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of the district court, or his or
43 her designee, and with leave of the court where:
44 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts,
45 that the defendant has attained competency;
-
*AB467_R2*

– 5 –
1 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges
2 again; and
3 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for
4 commencing a criminal action for the crime with which the
5 defendant was charged, has not lapsed since the date of the alleged
6 offense.
7  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made
8 pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
9 than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.
10 [6.] 7. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this
11 section, the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the
12 finding, on a form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a
13 record of that finding to be transmitted to the Central Repository for
14 Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
15 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each
16 appropriate database of the National Instant Criminal Background
17 Check System.
18 [7.] 8. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal
19 Background Check System” has the meaning ascribed to it in
20 NRS 179A.062.
21 Sec. 6. (Deleted by amendment.)
22 Sec. 7. NRS 178.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 178.450 1. The Administrator or the Administrator’s
24 designee shall keep each defendant committed to custody under
25 NRS 178.425 or 178.460 under observation and shall have each
26 defendant who has been ordered to report to the Administrator as an
27 outpatient under those sections evaluated periodically.
28 2. The Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall
29 report in writing to a judge of the court which committed the person
30 and the prosecuting attorney of the county or city to which the
31 person may be returned for further court action whether, in his or
32 her opinion, upon medical consultation, the defendant is of
33 sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of the
34 criminal charge against the defendant and, by reason thereof, is able
35 to aid and assist counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial or
36 against the pronouncement of the judgment thereafter. The
37 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall submit such a
38 report, in the case of a person charged or convicted of a
39 misdemeanor, within 3 months after the order for commitment or
40 treatment and evaluation as an outpatient or for recommitment
41 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 4 of NRS 178.460, and at
42 monthly intervals thereafter. In all other cases, the initial report must
43 be submitted within 6 months after the order and at 6-month
44 intervals thereafter. If the opinion of the Administrator or the
45 Administrator’s designee is that the defendant is not of sufficient
-
*AB467_R2*

– 6 –
1 mentality to understand the nature of the charge against the
2 defendant and assist in the defendant’s own defense, the
3 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall also include in
4 the report his or her opinion whether:
5 (a) There is a substantial probability that the defendant can
6 receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to stand
7 trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable
8 future; and
9 (b) The defendant is at that time a danger to himself or herself or
10 to society.
11 3. The report must contain:
12 (a) The name of the defendant and the county or city to which
13 the defendant may be returned for further court action.
14 (b) The circumstances under which the defendant was
15 committed to the custody of the Administrator or the
16 Administrator’s designee and the duration of the defendant’s
17 [hospitalization,] treatment to competency or the circumstances
18 under which the defendant was ordered to report to the
19 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient.
20 Sec. 8. (Deleted by amendment.)
21 Sec. 9. NRS 178.460 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 178.460 1. If requested by the district attorney or counsel for
23 the defendant within 10 days after the report by the Administrator or
24 the Administrator’s designee is sent to them, the judge shall hold a
25 hearing within 10 days after the request at which the district attorney
26 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
27 team on their report.
28 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
29 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
30 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
31 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
32 county.
33 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
34 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a
35 finding of competence or incompetence, and if the judge finds the
36 defendant to be incompetent:
37 (a) Whether there is substantial probability that the defendant
38 can receive treatment to competency and will attain competency to
39 stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in the foreseeable
40 future; and
41 (b) Whether the defendant is at that time a danger to himself or
42 herself or to society.
43 4. If the judge finds the defendant:
44 (a) Competent, the judge shall, within 10 days, forward the
45 finding to the prosecuting attorney and counsel for the defendant.
-
*AB467_R2*

– 7 –
1 Upon receipt thereof, the prosecuting attorney shall notify the
2 sheriff of the county or chief of police of the city that the defendant
3 has been found competent and prearrange with the facility , if
4 applicable, for the return of the defendant to that county or city for
5 trial upon the offense there charged or the pronouncement of
6 judgment, as the case may be. If the defendant is receiving
7 treatment to competency through a facility located within the
8 county jail or detention facility pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
9 178.425, the judge shall order the defendant discharged from the
10 facility for treatment to competency within the jail or detention
11 facility. A defendant so discharged may continue to reside in a
12 designated mental health unit of a jail or detention facility to
13 continue mental health treatment not related to treatment to
14 competency. If the defendant is receiving treatment through a
15 program established pursuant to subsection 3 of section 3 of this
16 act, the judge shall order the termination of such treatment.
17 (b) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
18 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
19 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
20 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is dangerous to
21 himself or herself or to society, the judge shall recommit the
22 defendant and may order the involuntary administration of
23 medication for the purpose of treatment to competency.
24 (c) Incompetent, but there is a substantial probability that the
25 defendant can receive treatment to competency and will attain
26 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment in
27 the foreseeable future and finds that the defendant is not dangerous
28 to himself or herself or to society, the judge shall order that the
29 defendant remain an outpatient or be transferred to the status of an
30 outpatient under the provisions of NRS 178.425.
31 (d) Incompetent, with no substantial probability of attaining
32 competency in the foreseeable future, the judge shall order the
33 defendant released from custody or, if the defendant is an outpatient,
34 released from any obligations as an outpatient if, within 10 judicial
35 days, the prosecuting attorney has not filed a motion pursuant to
36 NRS 178.461 or if, within 10 judicial days, a petition is not filed for
37 the involuntary court-ordered admission of the person to a mental
38 health facility pursuant to NRS 433A.200. After the initial 10
39 judicial days, the person may remain an outpatient or in custody
40 under the provisions of this chapter only as long as the motion or
41 petition is pending unless the person is committed to the custody of
42 the Administrator pursuant to NRS 178.461 or involuntarily
43 admitted to a mental health facility pursuant to chapter 433A of
44 NRS.

*AB467_R2*

– 8 –
1 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 7 of NRS
2 178.461, no person who is committed under the provisions of this
3 chapter may be held in the custody of the Administrator or the
4 Administrator’s designee longer than the longest period of
5 incarceration provided for the crime or crimes with which the
6 person is charged or 10 years, whichever period is shorter. Upon
7 expiration of the applicable period provided in this section,
8 subsection 4 or 7 of NRS 178.461 or subsection 4 of NRS 178.463,
9 the person must be returned to the committing court for a
10 determination as to whether or not involuntary commitment
11 pursuant to chapter 433A of NRS is required.
12 Sec. 9.5. NRS 178.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is
14 charged with any category A felony or a category B felony listed in
15 subsection 6 are dismissed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 of NRS
16 178.425, the prosecuting attorney may, within 10 judicial days after
17 the dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
18 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator
19 pursuant to subsection 3.
20 2. If the prosecuting attorney files a motion pursuant to
21 subsection 1, the prosecuting attorney shall, not later than the date
22 on which the prosecuting attorney files the motion, request from the
23 Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates whether
24 the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic
25 facility. The Division shall, except as otherwise provided in this
26 subsection, complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40
27 calendar days after receipt of the request and provide the
28 comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the prosecuting attorney
29 and counsel for the person. The court may grant the Division an
30 extension to complete the comprehensive risk assessment upon a
31 showing of good cause. Within 10 judicial days after receipt of the
32 comprehensive risk assessment, the court shall hold a hearing on the
33 motion. If the person was charged with any category A felony other
34 than murder or sexual assault or a category B felony listed in
35 subsection 6 and the comprehensive risk assessment indicates that
36 the person does not require the level of security provided by a
37 forensic facility, the court shall dismiss the motion.
38 3. At a hearing held pursuant to subsection 2, if the court finds
39 by clear and convincing evidence that the person has a mental
40 disorder, that the person is a danger to himself or herself or others
41 and that the person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires
42 placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:
43 (a) The sheriff to take the person into protective custody and
44 transport the person to a forensic facility; and

1 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the
2 Administrator and kept under observation until the person is eligible
3 for conditional release pursuant to NRS 178.463 or until the
4 maximum length of commitment described in subsection 4 or 7 has
5 expired.
6 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the length of
7 commitment of a person pursuant to subsection 3 must not exceed
8 10 years, including any time that the person has been on conditional
9 release pursuant to NRS 178.463.
10 5. At least once every 12 months, the court shall review the
11 eligibility of the defendant for conditional release.
12 6. The provisions of subsection 1 apply to any of the following
13 category B felonies:
14 (a) Voluntary manslaughter pursuant to NRS 200.050;

24 NRS 205.067;
25 (j) Any category B felony involving the use of a firearm; and
26 (k) Any attempt to commit a category A felony.
27 7. If a person is within 6 months of the maximum length of
28 commitment set forth in this subsection or subsection 4, as
29 applicable, and:
30 (a) Was charged with murder or sexual assault; and
31 (b) Was committed to the custody of the Administrator pursuant
32 to this subsection or subsection 3,
33  the Administrator may file a motion to request an extension of
34 the length of commitment for not more than 5 additional years.
35 8. The court may grant a motion for an extension of the length
36 of commitment pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted
37 on the motion, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
38 the person is a danger to himself or herself or others and that the
39 person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires placement at
40 a forensic facility.
41 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person
42 who is committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the
43 person does not have counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to
44 represent the person.

3 Sec. 13. NRS 412.4485 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 412.4485 1. Unless otherwise stated in this section, in the
5 case of a person determined pursuant to NRS 412.2645 to be
6 incompetent, the provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
7 inclusive, and section 3 of this act are applicable. References to the
8 court in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 3 of this
9 act, and to the judge of such court, shall be deemed to refer to the
10 convening authority having authority to convene a general court-
11 martial for that person. However, if the person is no longer subject
12 to this Code at a time relevant to the application to the person of the
13 relevant provisions of NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and
14 section 3 of this act, the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in
15 the county where the person is committed or otherwise may be
16 found retains the powers specified in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715,
17 inclusive, and section 3 of this act as if it were the court that
18 ordered the commitment of the person.
19 2. When the director of a facility in which a person is
20 hospitalized pursuant to the actions taken by the convening authority
21 having authority to convene a general court-martial for that person
22 determines that the person is able to understand the nature of the
23 proceedings against the person and to conduct or cooperate
24 intelligently in the defense of the case, the director shall promptly
25 transmit a notification of that determination to the convening
26 authority having authority to convene a general court-martial for the
27 person, the person’s counsel and the authority having custody of the
28 person. The authority having custody of the person may retain
29 custody of the person for not more than 30 days after receiving
30 notification that the person has recovered to such an extent that the
31 person is able to understand the nature of the proceedings against
32 the person and to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of
33 the case.
34 3. Upon receipt of a notification pursuant to subsection 2, the
35 convening authority having authority to convene a general court-
36 martial for the person shall promptly take custody of the person
37 unless the person to which the notification applies is no longer
38 subject to this Code. If the person is no longer subject to this Code,
39 the state trial court with felony jurisdiction in the county where the
40 person is committed or otherwise may be found may take any action
41 within the authority of that court that the court considers appropriate
42 regarding the person.

5 433B.320 1. In any case involving commitment by court
6 order, except a case where commitment was ordered by a juvenile
7 court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, admission to a
8 treatment facility may be only after consultation with and approval
9 by the administrative officer of the facility or the administrative
10 officer’s designee, who shall determine whether the treatment
11 available at the facility is appropriate or necessary for the child’s
12 health and welfare.
13 2. In a case where commitment to a treatment facility was
14 ordered by a juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185,
15 [if] the administrative officer or the administrative officer’s
16 designee shall immediately accept placement of the child at the
17 treatment facility. If the administrative officer of the facility or the
18 administrative officer’s designee has determined that the treatment
19 available at the facility is not [appropriate or necessary for the
20 child’s health and welfare and for the protection of the community,]
21 best situated to treat the child, the administrative officer or the
22 administrative officer’s designee shall [assist] :
23 (a) Assist the court with identifying a facility that [has the
24 appropriate or necessary] is better situated to provide the necessary
25 treatment [.] ; and
26 (b) Ensure that the child receives treatment at the treatment
27 facility, within the capabilities of the treatment facility, until a
28 more suitable facility is found.
29 3. Except in a case where commitment was ordered by a
30 juvenile court pursuant to NRS 62D.180 or 62D.185, a child
31 committed by court order must not be released from a treatment
32 facility until the administrative officer determines that treatment in
33 the facility is no longer beneficial to the child.
