EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; revising provisions governing the prohibition against
the waste of certain animals; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits any person from causing any edible portion of any game mammal,
2 game fish, game amphibian and certain game birds from going to waste. (NRS 503.050) A
3 person who violates this prohibition is: (1) guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a
4 fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not
5 more than 6 months, or by both fine [or] and imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil
6 penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) In addition, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is
7 authorized under existing law to revoke any license issued by the Department of Wildlife to
8 any person convicted of violating this prohibition and may refuse to issue any new license to
9 the convicted person for up to 5 years after the date of the conviction. (NRS 501.388) Existing
10 regulations interpret the term “edible portion” in existing law to mean certain identified edible
11 parts of a game mammal, game fish, certain game birds and a big game mammal, except for a
12 mountain lion and black bear. (NAC 503.0047) Section 1 of this bill [codifies this
13 interpretation of the term “edible portion” in the Nevada Revised Statutes but eliminates the
14 exception for a mountain lion or black bear.] specifies that this prohibition applies to any
15 big game mammal and provides a definition of that term, which includes a mountain
16 lion and black bear. Thus, section 1 clarifies that the prohibition applies to causing any
17 edible portion of a mountain lion or black bear from going to waste.
18 Subject to the same penalties, existing law also prohibits any person from capturing or
19 destroying any game mammal, except a carnivore, and detaching or removing from the
20 carcass the head, hide, antlers, horns or tusks only and leaving the carcass to waste. (NRS
21 501.385, 501.3855, 501.388, 503.050) Section 1 eliminates the exception from this
22 prohibition for a carnivore, thus making the prohibition apply with respect to any game
23 mammal [.] , and specifies that a game mammal includes a big game mammal, as defined
24 in that section.
25 Section 2 of this bill [declares void the regulation interpreting “edible portion.”] requires
26 the Board of Wildlife Commissioners, on or before July 1, 2026, to adopt such
27 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of section 1.
