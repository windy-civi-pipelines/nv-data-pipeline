EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; revising provisions governing the
prohibition against the waste of certain animals; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits any person from causing any edible portion of any game
2 mammal, game fish, game amphibian and certain game birds from going to waste.
3 (NRS 503.050) A person who violates this prohibition is: (1) guilty of a
4 misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500,
5 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months, or by both fine or
6 imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) In
7 addition, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is authorized under existing law to
8 revoke any license issued by the Department of Wildlife to any person convicted of
9 violating this prohibition and may refuse to issue any new license to the convicted
10 person for up to 5 years after the date of the conviction. (NRS 501.388) Existing
11 regulations interpret the term “edible portion” in existing law to mean certain
12 identified edible parts of a game mammal, game fish, certain game birds and a big
13 game mammal, except for a mountain lion and black bear. (NAC 503.0047)
14 Section 1 of this bill codifies this interpretation of the term “edible portion” in the
15 Nevada Revised Statutes but eliminates the exception for a mountain lion or black
16 bear. Thus, section 1 clarifies that the prohibition applies to causing any edible
17 portion of a mountain lion or black bear from going to waste.
18 Subject to the same penalties, existing law also prohibits any person from
19 capturing or destroying any game mammal, except a carnivore, and detaching or
20 removing from the carcass the head, hide, antlers, horns or tusks only and leaving
21 the carcass to waste. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855, 501.388, 503.050) Section 1
22 eliminates the exception from this prohibition for a carnivore, thus making the
23 prohibition apply with respect to any game mammal.

2 503.050 1. It is unlawful for any person to cause through

4 bird, game mammal, game fish or game amphibian to go to waste
5 needlessly.

7 mammal [, except a carnivore,] and detach or remove from the
8 carcass the head, hide, antlers, horns or tusks only and leave the
9 carcass to waste.
