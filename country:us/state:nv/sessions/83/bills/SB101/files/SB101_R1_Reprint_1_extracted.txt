EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; revising provisions governing the
prohibition against the waste of certain animals; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits any person from causing any edible portion of any game
2 mammal, game fish, game amphibian and certain game birds from going to waste.
3 (NRS 503.050) A person who violates this prohibition is: (1) guilty of a
4 misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500,
5 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months, or by both fine
6 and imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS 501.385,
7 501.3855) In addition, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is authorized under
8 existing law to revoke any license issued by the Department of Wildlife to any
9 person convicted of violating this prohibition and may refuse to issue any new
10 license to the convicted person for up to 5 years after the date of the conviction.
11 (NRS 501.388) Existing regulations interpret the term “edible portion” in existing
12 law to mean certain identified edible parts of a game mammal, game fish, certain
13 game birds and a big game mammal, except for a mountain lion and black bear.
14 (NAC 503.0047) Section 1 of this bill specifies that this prohibition applies to any
15 big game mammal and provides a definition of that term, which includes a
16 mountain lion and black bear. Thus, section 1 clarifies that the prohibition applies
17 to causing any edible portion of a mountain lion or black bear from going to waste.
18 Subject to the same penalties, existing law also prohibits any person from
19 capturing or destroying any game mammal, except a carnivore, and detaching or
20 removing from the carcass the head, hide, antlers, horns or tusks only and leaving
21 the carcass to waste. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855, 501.388, 503.050) Section 1
22 eliminates the exception from this prohibition for a carnivore, thus making the
-

– 2 –
23 prohibition apply with respect to any game mammal, and specifies that a game
24 mammal includes a big game mammal, as defined in that section.
25 Section 2 of this bill requires the Board of Wildlife Commissioners, on or
26 before July 1, 2026, to adopt such regulations as are necessary to carry out the
27 provisions of section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 503.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 503.050 1. It is unlawful for any person to cause through
3 carelessness, neglect or otherwise any edible portion of any game
4 bird, game mammal, including, without limitation, a big game
5 mammal, game fish or game amphibian to go to waste needlessly.
6 2. It is unlawful for any person to capture or destroy any game
7 mammal, [except a carnivore,] including, without limitation, a big
8 game mammal, and detach or remove from the carcass the head,
9 hide, antlers, horns or tusks only and leave the carcass to waste.
10 3. [For the purposes of subsection 1, “game] As used in this
11 section:
12 (a) “Big game mammal” means any:
13 (1) Pronghorn antelope, black bear, mule deer, mountain
14 goat, mountain lion, moose or Rocky Mountain elk; or
15 (2) Of the following subspecies of bighorn sheep:
16 (I) Nelson bighorn sheep;
17 (II) California bighorn sheep; or
18 (III) Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep.
19 (b) “Game bird” does not include a raven, crow or magpie even
20 if classified as a game bird pursuant to NRS 501.110.
21 Sec. 2. The Board of Wildlife Commissioners shall, on or
22 before July 1, 2026, adopt such regulations as are necessary to carry
23 out the provisions of NRS 503.050, as amended by section 1 of this
