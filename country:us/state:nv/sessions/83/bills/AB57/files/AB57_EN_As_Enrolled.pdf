appoint committee members jointly with the Chief of the
Division of Emergency Management of the Office of the
Military; and providing other matters properly relating

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Nevada Intrastate Mutual Aid System within the
Division of Emergency Management of the Office of the Military to coordinate
requests for intrastate mutual aid among various public agencies and certain Indian
tribes and nations in response to an emergency or disaster in this State. Under
existing law, the Chief of the Division of Emergency Management is required to
administer the System and adopt regulations relating to the administration of the
System. (NRS 414A.100) Section 4 of this bill transfers to the State Forester
Firewarden of the Division of Forestry of the State Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources the authority to: (1) coordinate the provision of mutual aid
during the response to and recovery from wildfire suppression; (2) administer the
System as it relates to wildfire suppression; and (3) adopt regulations relating to the
administration of the System as it relates to wildfire suppression.
Under existing law, the Chief of the Division of Emergency Management
serves as the Chair of the Intrastate Mutual Aid Committee and appoints the
committee members, who advise the Chief on issues related to emergency
management and intrastate mutual aid. (NRS 414A.110) Under section 5 of this
bill, the State Forester Firewarden serves as Co-Chair of the Committee with the
Chief of the Division of Emergency Management and committee members must be
jointly appointed by the Chief of the Division of Emergency Management and the
State Forester Firewarden.
Under existing law, a public agency that participates in the System may elect to
withdraw from participation in the System, and any federally recognized Indian
tribe or nation within the boundaries of the State may become a participant in the
System, by adopting a resolution declaring the same and providing a copy of the
resolution to the Division of Emergency Management and the Governor. (NRS
414A.120) Section 6 of this bill requires that a copy of such a resolution also be
provided to the Division of Forestry.
Under existing law, a participant may request intrastate mutual aid through the
Division of Emergency Management, or directly to a participant if an urgent
response is needed, and each request must be documented and forwarded to the
Division of Emergency Management within 24 hours. (NRS 414A.130) Section 7
of this bill provides that a participant may request intrastate mutual aid through the
Division of Forestry for aid relating to wildfire suppression and through the
Division of Emergency Management for aid relating to all other emergencies or

disasters. Section 7 further requires that requests for aid be documented and
reported to the Division of Forestry or Division of Emergency Management, as
appropriate.
Under existing law, the Division of Emergency Management: (1) may facilitate
certain System participants in obtaining reimbursement for intrastate mutual aid;
and (2) is not liable for any claim relating to reimbursement. (NRS 414A.150)
Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Division of Forestry to also facilitate
reimbursement of System participants and provides immunity from liability to the
Division of Forestry for any claim relating to reimbursement.
Sections 1 and 3 of this bill define “Division of Forestry” and “Division of
Emergency Management,” respectively. Section 2 of this bill applies these
definitions to the provisions of existing law relating to the System.
