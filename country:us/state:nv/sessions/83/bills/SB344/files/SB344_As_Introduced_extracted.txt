AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
cover certain screenings for genetic disorders in a fetus or
the parents of a fetus; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid
2 and health plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for
3 medically necessary biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate
4 management and ongoing monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is
5 supported by medical and scientific evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
6 422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859,
7 695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703) Existing law also requires such
8 health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant woman for the discovery of
9 certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173,
10 608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
11 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections 2, 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill
12 require such insurers to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is
13 pregnant to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, 2, 4-10, 12
14 and 14-16 prohibit such insurers from requiring prior authorization for such
15 screenings. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to
16 require that certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a
17 person who resides in another state include the coverage required by section 2.
18 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
19 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
-
*SB344*
– 2 –
20 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
21 such action against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the
22 requirements of sections 2, 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) Section 16 additionally
23 requires Medicaid to cover certain screenings of the parents of a fetus to determine
24 if they are carriers of certain genetic disorders without requiring prior authorization
25 for such screenings. Section 13 of this bill requires the Director of the Department
26 of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the
27 same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.

MARCH 12, 2025

Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Requires certain health insurance to cover certain
screenings for certain genetic disorders.
(BDR 57-1104)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 14)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
cover certain screenings for genetic disorders in a fetus or
the parents of a fetus; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid
2 and health plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for
3 medically necessary biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate
4 management and ongoing monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is
5 supported by medical and scientific evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
6 422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859,
7 695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703) Existing law also requires such
8 health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant woman for the discovery of
9 certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173,
10 608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
11 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections 2, 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill
12 require such insurers to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is
13 pregnant to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, 2, 4-10, 12
14 and 14-16 prohibit such insurers from requiring prior authorization for such
15 screenings. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to
16 require that certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a
17 person who resides in another state include the coverage required by section 2.
18 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
19 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
-
*SB344*

– 2 –
20 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
21 such action against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the
22 requirements of sections 2, 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) Section 16 additionally
23 requires Medicaid to cover certain screenings of the parents of a fetus to determine
24 if they are carriers of certain genetic disorders without requiring prior authorization
25 for such screenings. Section 13 of this bill requires the Director of the Department
26 of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the
27 same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
