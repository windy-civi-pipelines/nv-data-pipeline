CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
cover certain screenings for genetic disorders in a fetus or the
parents of a fetus; making an appropriation; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid
and health plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for
medically necessary biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate
management and ongoing monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is
supported by medical and scientific evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859,
695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703) Existing law also requires such
health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant woman for the discovery of
certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173,
608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require
such insurers that issue group health care plans, as well as fraternal benefit societies
and Medicaid, to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is pregnant
to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, 4-10, 12 and 14-16
prohibit such insurers from requiring prior authorization for such screenings.
Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
such action against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the
requirements of section 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) Section 13 of this bill
requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as the provisions of
existing law governing Medicaid. Section 16.5 of this bill makes an appropriation
to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
and Human Services for the costs associated with the Medicaid coverage required
by section 16.
