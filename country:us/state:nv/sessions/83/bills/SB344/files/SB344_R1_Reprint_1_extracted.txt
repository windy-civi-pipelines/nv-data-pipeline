AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid
2 and health plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for
3 medically necessary biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate
4 management and ongoing monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is
5 supported by medical and scientific evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
6 422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859,
7 695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703) Existing law also requires such
8 health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant woman for the discovery of
9 certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173,
10 608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
11 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require
12 such insurers that issue group health care plans, as well as fraternal benefit societies
13 and Medicaid, to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is pregnant
14 to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, 4-10, 12 and 14-16
15 prohibit such insurers from requiring prior authorization for such screenings.
16 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
17 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
18 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
19 such action against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the
-

– 2 –
20 requirements of section 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) Section 13 of this bill
21 requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
22 administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as the provisions of
23 existing law governing Medicaid. Section 16.5 of this bill makes an appropriation
24 to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
25 and Human Services for the costs associated with the Medicaid coverage required
26 by section 16.

AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
cover certain screenings for genetic disorders in a fetus or
the parents of a fetus; making an appropriation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid
2 and health plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for
3 medically necessary biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate
4 management and ongoing monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is
5 supported by medical and scientific evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
6 422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859,
7 695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703) Existing law also requires such
8 health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant woman for the discovery of
9 certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173,
10 608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
11 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require
12 such insurers that issue group health care plans, as well as fraternal benefit societies
13 and Medicaid, to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is pregnant
14 to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, 4-10, 12 and 14-16
15 prohibit such insurers from requiring prior authorization for such screenings.
16 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
17 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
18 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
19 such action against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the
-
*SB344_R1*

– 2 –
20 requirements of section 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) Section 13 of this bill
21 requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
22 administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as the provisions of
23 existing law governing Medicaid. Section 16.5 of this bill makes an appropriation
24 to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
25 and Human Services for the costs associated with the Medicaid coverage required
26 by section 16.
