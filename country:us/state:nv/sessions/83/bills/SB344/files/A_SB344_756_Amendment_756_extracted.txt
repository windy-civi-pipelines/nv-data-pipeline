AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to cover certain

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid and health
2 plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for medically necessary
3 biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate management and ongoing
4 monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is supported by medical and scientific
5 evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361,
6 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859, 695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703)
7 Existing law also requires such health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant
8 woman for the discovery of certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
9 422.27173, 608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
10 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections [2,] 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require such
11 insurers that issue group health care plans, as well as fraternal benefit societies and
12 Medicaid, to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is pregnant to detect
13 chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, [2,] 4-10, 12 and 14-16 prohibit such
14 insurers from requiring prior authorization for such screenings. [Section 3 of this bill
15 authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance
16 issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage
17 required by section 2.] Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or
18 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action
20 against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of [sections 2,]
21 section 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) [Section 16 additionally requires Medicaid to cover
22 certain screenings of the parents of a fetus to determine if they are carriers of certain genetic
23 disorders without requiring prior authorization for such screenings.] Section 13 of this bill
24 requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
Senate Amendment No. 756 to Senate Bill No. 344 Page 4
25 provisions of section 16 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
26 Medicaid. Section 16.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care
27 Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services for the costs
28 associated with the Medicaid coverage required by section 16.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 14)

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to cover certain
screenings for genetic disorders in a fetus or the parents of a fetus;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private insurers, including Medicaid and health
2 plans for public and private employees, to provide coverage for medically necessary
3 biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate management and ongoing
4 monitoring of cancer when such biomarker testing is supported by medical and scientific
5 evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.272364, 608.1555, 689A.0446, 689B.0361,
6 689C.1688, 689C.425, 695A.1859, 695B.19087, 695C.050, 695C.16932, 695G.1703)
7 Existing law also requires such health insurance to cover the examination of a pregnant
8 woman for the discovery of certain sexually transmitted diseases. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
9 422.27173, 608.1555, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 689C.925, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
10 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Sections [2,] 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require such
11 insurers that issue group health care plans, as well as fraternal benefit societies and
12 Medicaid, to cover certain screenings of the blood of a person who is pregnant to detect
13 chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Sections 1, [2,] 4-10, 12 and 14-16 prohibit such
14 insurers from requiring prior authorization for such screenings. [Section 3 of this bill
15 authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance
16 issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage
17 required by section 2.] Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or
18 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action
20 against other private health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of [sections 2,]
21 section 4-8, 10 or 12. (NRS 680A.200) [Section 16 additionally requires Medicaid to cover
22 certain screenings of the parents of a fetus to determine if they are carriers of certain genetic
23 disorders without requiring prior authorization for such screenings.] Section 13 of this bill
24 requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the

Senate Amendment No. 756 to Senate Bill No. 344 Page 4
25 provisions of section 16 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
26 Medicaid. Section 16.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care
27 Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services for the costs
28 associated with the Medicaid coverage required by section 16.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 687B.225 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 687B.225 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 689A.0405, 689A.0412,

7 695B.1919, 695B.19197, 695B.1924, 695B.1925, 695B.1942, 695C.1696,
8 695C.1699, 695C.1713, 695C.1735, 695C.1737, 695C.1743, 695C.1745,
9 695C.1751, 695G.170, 695G.1705, 695G.171, 695G.1714, 695G.1715, 695G.1719
10 and 695G.177, and sections [2,] 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12 of this act, any contract for
11 group, blanket or individual health insurance or any contract by a nonprofit
12 hospital, medical or dental service corporation or organization for dental care which
13 provides for payment of a certain part of medical or dental care may require the
14 insured or member to obtain prior authorization for that care from the insurer or
15 organization. The insurer or organization shall:
16 (a) File its procedure for obtaining approval of care pursuant to this section for
17 approval by the Commissioner; and
18 (b) Unless a shorter time period is prescribed by a specific statute, including,
19 without limitation, NRS 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 689C.1688, 695A.1859,
20 695B.19087, 695C.16932 and 695G.1703, respond to any request for approval by
21 the insured or member pursuant to this section within 20 days after it receives the
22 request.
23 2. The procedure for prior authorization may not discriminate among persons
24 licensed to provide the covered care.
25 Sec. 2. [Chapter 689A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
26 section to read as follows:
27 1. An insurer that offers or issues a policy of health insurance shall include
28 in the policy coverage for noninvasive prenatal screening at any time during
29 pregnancy. Such coverage must be provided without prior authorization.
30 2. A policy of health insurance subject to the provisions of this chapter that
31 is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, has the
32 legal effect of including the coverage required by subsection 1, and any provision
33 of the policy that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
34 3. As used in this section, “noninvasive prenatal screening” means drawing
35 blood from a person who is pregnant to perform laboratory analysis on the
36 deoxyribonucleic acid circulating in the maternal blood stream for the purpose of
37 detecting chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.] (Deleted by amendment.)
38 Sec. 3. [NRS 689A.330 is hereby amended to read as follows:
39 689A.330 If any policy is issued by a domestic insurer for delivery to a
40 person residing in another state, and if the insurance commissioner or
41 corresponding public officer of that other state has informed the Commissioner that
42 the policy is not subject to approval or disapproval by that officer, the

Senate Amendment No. 756 to Senate Bill No. 344 Page 5
1 Commissioner may by ruling require that the policy meet the standards set forth in
