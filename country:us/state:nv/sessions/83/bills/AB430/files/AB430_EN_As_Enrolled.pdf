Assembly Bill No. 430–Assemblymembers Flanagan; Brown-May,
D’Silva and Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to money transmission; exempting a person
engaged solely in the provision of payroll processing services
from provisions governing the licensure and regulation of
persons engaged in money transmission; repealing provisions
imposing certain duties on persons engaged in the provision
of payroll processing services; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Commissioner of
Financial Institutions of persons engaged in money transmission. (Chapter 671 of
NRS) Existing law defines “money transmission” to include payroll processing
services, thereby requiring a person engaged solely in the provision of payroll
processing services to be licensed by the Commissioner. (NRS 671.013) Section 1
of this bill removes provisions which include the provision of payroll processing
services within the definition of money transmission. Section 2 of this bill exempts
a person engaged solely in the provision of payroll processing services from the
provisions governing money transmission. As such, under sections 1 and 2, a
person engaged solely in the provision of payroll processing services is not required
to obtain a license from the Commissioner, under the provisions of existing law
governing money transmission, to engage in the provision of payroll processing
services.
Section 3 of this bill repeals provisions setting forth certain duties of persons
engaged in the provision of payroll processing services.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
