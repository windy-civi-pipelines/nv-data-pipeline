EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to money transmission; exempting a person
engaged solely in the provision of payroll processing
services from provisions governing the licensure and
regulation of persons engaged in money transmission;
repealing provisions imposing certain duties on persons
engaged in the provision of payroll processing services;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Commissioner of
2 Financial Institutions of persons engaged in money transmission. (Chapter 671 of
3 NRS) Existing law defines “money transmission” to include payroll processing
4 services, thereby requiring a person engaged solely in the provision of payroll
5 processing services to be licensed by the Commissioner. (NRS 671.013) Section 1
6 of this bill removes provisions which include the provision of payroll processing
7 services within the definition of money transmission. Section 2 of this bill exempts
8 a person engaged solely in the provision of payroll processing services from the
9 provisions governing money transmission. As such, under sections 1 and 2, a
10 person engaged solely in the provision of payroll processing services is not required
11 to obtain a license from the Commissioner, under the provisions of existing law
12 governing money transmission, to engage in the provision of payroll processing
13 services.
14 Section 3 of this bill repeals provisions setting forth certain duties of persons
15 engaged in the provision of payroll processing services.
