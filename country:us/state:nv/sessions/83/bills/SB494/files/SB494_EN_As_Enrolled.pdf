apportioned among the properties in proportion to their net values at

3. The beneficiary or beneficiaries under a deed upon death

the manner specified in paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS 155.020
and mail a copy of the notice to:

............................., ..........., and that said grantor(s) died on the
......... day of ............................., ............, and that said
grantor(s) had a date of birth of the ......... day of
............................., ............ A creditor having a claim against
the grantor(s) or their estate must file a claim with the
undersigned at the address given below within 90 days after

5. A person or entity having a claim, due or to become due,
against a grantor or his or her probate estate, as applicable, must file
the claim with the beneficiary or beneficiaries within 90 days after

publication of the first notice to creditors pursuant to subsection 3.
Any claim against a grantor or the probate estate of a grantor, as
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 44 –
applicable, not filed within that time is forever barred. After the
expiration of the time to file a claim as provided in this section, the
beneficiary or beneficiaries may sell or distribute the property
transferred pursuant to the deed upon death, without personal liability
for any claim which has not been timely filed with the beneficiary or
beneficiaries if, in accordance with subsection 6, the beneficiary or
beneficiaries have received a waiver of claim after providing written
notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services] Nevada
Health Authority as required by subsection 3.
6. If notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
Nevada Health Authority is not given, the property transferred by the
deed upon death remains subject to the right of the [Department]
Authority to recover public assistance received by the grantor. The
[Department] Authority may initiate an action to impose a lien on the
real property transferred by the deed upon death pursuant to NRS
422.29306, take any other action allowable by law to secure the future
recovery of benefits or make a written demand for payment, as

or beneficiaries in writing within 45 days after receipt of a notice
pursuant to subsection 3 whether the grantor was a recipient of public
assistance and, if he or she was not a recipient of assistance, provide
an original waiver of claim to the beneficiaries for the purposes of
recording the deed upon death.
7. For claims not originating with the [Department of Health and
Human Services,] Nevada Health Authority, if a claim is rejected by
the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon death, in whole
or in part, the beneficiary or beneficiaries must, within 10 days after
the rejection, notify the claimant of the rejection by written notice
sent by registered or certified mail to the mailing address of the
claimant. The claimant must bring suit in the proper court against the
beneficiary or beneficiaries within 30 days after the notice is sent,

beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon death may distribute
the property transferred by the deed upon death without personal
liability to any creditor whose claim is barred forever.
8. A title company that is engaged regarding the transfer of the
property identified in a deed upon death may recognize that the
notices provided pursuant to this section constitute adequate notice
required by law. A title company is not liable for claims of which the
title company is not made aware by the beneficiaries.
9. A person dealing with a beneficiary of a deed upon death has
the same rights and protections as the person would have if the
beneficiary had been named as a distributee of the property in an order
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 45 –
for distribution of the grantor’s estate that had become final if both of
the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The person acted in good faith and for valuable consideration;
and
(b) A Death of Grantor Affidavit was recorded pursuant to
NRS 111.699.
Sec. 44. NRS 111.779 is hereby amended to read as follows:
111.779 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 21.090 and
other applicable law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is liable to
the probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that
decedent’s probate estate to the extent the estate is insufficient to
satisfy those claims.
2. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the
value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that
transferee.
3. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency
described in subsection 1 in the following order of priority:
(a) A transferee specified in the decedent’s will or any other
governing instrument as being liable for such an insufficiency, in the
order of priority provided in the will or other governing instrument;
(b) The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate
instrument in the decedent’s estate plan as shown by its designation
as devisee of the decedent’s residuary estate or by other facts or
circumstances, to the extent of the value of the nonprobate transfer
received or controlled; and
(c) Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values
received.
4. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests of
beneficiaries in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section abate
as necessary to satisfy the liability, as if all the trust instruments were
a single will and the interests were devises under it.
5. If a nonprobate transferee is a spouse or a minor child, the
nonprobate transferee may petition the court to be excluded from the
liability imposed by this section as if the nonprobate property
received by the spouse or minor child were part of the decedent’s
estate. Such a petition may be made pursuant to the applicable
provisions of chapter 146 of NRS, including, without limitation, the
provisions of NRS 146.010 and 146.020 and subsection 2 of
NRS 146.070.
6. A provision made in one instrument may direct the
apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees
taking under that or any other governing instrument. If a provision in
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 46 –
one instrument conflicts with a provision in another, the later one
prevails.
7. Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability
imposed by this section is enforceable in probate proceedings in this
State, whether or not the transferee is located in this State.
8. If a probate proceeding is pending at the time of filing and it
has been determined by a final order issued by the probate court that
there are insufficient assets to pay a valid creditor, a proceeding under
this section may be commenced by one of the following persons:
(a) The personal representative of the decedent’s estate. A
personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a
proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.
(b) A creditor of the estate, if the personal representative has
declined or refused to commence an action within 30 days after
receiving a written demand by a creditor. Such demand must identify
the nonprobate transfers known to the creditor. If the creditor is
unaware of any nonprobate transfers, in the probate proceeding, the
creditor may, pursuant to NRS 155.170, obtain discovery, perpetuate
testimony or conduct examinations in any manner authorized by law
or by the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure to ascertain whether any
nonprobate transfers exist. If the creditor is unable to identify any
nonprobate transfers within a reasonable time after conducting
discovery, the creditor may not proceed under this section. If a
creditor commences an action under this section:
(1) The creditor must proceed at the expense of the creditor
and not of the estate.
(2) If a creditor successfully establishes an entitlement to
payment under this section and collects nonprobate transfers, the
court must order the reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred
by the creditor, including attorney’s fees, from the transferee from
whom the payment is to be made, subject to the limitations of
subsection 2, or from the estate as a cost of administration, or partially
from each, as the court deems just.
9. If a probate proceeding is not pending, a proceeding under
this section may be commenced as a civil action by a creditor at the
expense of the creditor.
10. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this section, it
must be commenced:
(a) If a probate proceeding is pending in which notice to creditors
has been given at the time of filing a proceeding under this section:
(1) As to a creditor whose claim was properly and timely filed,
allowed by the personal representative or partially allowed by the
personal representative, and accepted by the creditor pursuant to
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 47 –
NRS 147.160, within 60 days after the probate court enters an order
confirming the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final
and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year
after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
(2) As to a creditor:
(I) Whose claim was rejected by the personal
representative, partially allowed by the personal representative and
rejected by the creditor pursuant to NRS 147.160, or deemed rejected
by the personal representative pursuant to NRS 147.110;
(II) Who adjudicated the creditor’s claims in the proper
court or by a summary adjudication; and
(III) Who obtained a favorable final judgment on its claim
from the proper court,
 within 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming
the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final and no
longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the
decedent’s death, whichever is later.
(b) If an action had been commenced against the decedent before
the decedent’s death, the creditor receives a judgment against the
decedent’s estate and the creditor has filed a proper and timely
creditor’s claim against the estate, within 60 days after the probate
court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of the
adjudicated claim that is final and no longer subject to reconsideration
or appeal or within 1 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is
later.
(c) As to the recovery of benefits paid for Medicaid, within 3
years after the decedent’s death.
(d) As to all other creditors, within 1 year after the decedent’s
death.
11. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent’s probate
estate is nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and
statutory allowances has been received from the decedent’s personal
representative, the following rules apply:
(a) Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution,
registrar or other obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance
with the terms of the governing instrument controlling the transfer
releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets
delivered.
(b) A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is
released from liability under this section with respect to any assets
distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent
of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the
trustee’s liability attributable to assets received by the beneficiary.

12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 13,
notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:

sections 401 et seq. of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 401
et seq.; and
(V) A trust forming part of a qualified tuition program
pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS, any applicable regulations adopted
pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS and section 529 of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 529, unless the money is deposited after
the entry of a judgment against the purchaser or account owner or the
money will not be used by any beneficiary to attend a college or
university.
(3) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
by a decedent which transfers money, benefits or privileges that

trust.
(6) An irrevocable trust or amounts payable from a trust if the

(2) Has no duty to verify sworn information relating to the
nonprobate transfer. The protection provided by this subparagraph
applies to information that relates to the ownership interest of the
beneficiary in the property and the beneficiary’s right to sell,
encumber and transfer good title to a purchaser or lender and does not
relieve a purchaser or lender from the notice imparted by instruments
of record respecting the property.
13. Nothing in this section exempts any real or personal property
from any statute of this State that authorizes the recovery of money
owed to the [Department of Health and Human Services] Nevada
Health Authority as a result of the payment of benefits from
Medicaid.
14. As used in this section, “devise” has the meaning ascribed to
it in NRS 132.095.
Sec. 45. NRS 115.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
115.090 Nothing in this chapter exempts any real or personal
