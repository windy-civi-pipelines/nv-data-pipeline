5 5. A person or entity having a claim, due or to become due, against a grantor
6 or his or her probate estate, as applicable, must file the claim with the beneficiary or
7 beneficiaries within 90 days after the mailing, for those required to be mailed, or 90
8 days after publication of the first notice to creditors pursuant to subsection 3. Any
9 claim against a grantor or the probate estate of a grantor, as applicable, not filed
10 within that time is forever barred. After the expiration of the time to file a claim as
11 provided in this section, the beneficiary or beneficiaries may sell or distribute the
12 property transferred pursuant to the deed upon death, without personal liability for
13 any claim which has not been timely filed with the beneficiary or beneficiaries if, in
14 accordance with subsection 6, the beneficiary or beneficiaries have received a
15 waiver of claim after providing written notice to the [Department of Health and
16 Human Services] Nevada Health Authority as required by subsection 3.
17 6. If notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services] Nevada
18 Health Authority is not given, the property transferred by the deed upon death
19 remains subject to the right of the [Department] Authority to recover public
20 assistance received by the grantor. The [Department] Authority may initiate an
21 action to impose a lien on the real property transferred by the deed upon death
22 pursuant to NRS 422.29306, take any other action allowable by law to secure the
23 future recovery of benefits or make a written demand for payment, as applicable.
24 The [Department] Authority shall notify the beneficiary or beneficiaries in writing
25 within 45 days after receipt of a notice pursuant to subsection 3 whether the grantor
26 was a recipient of public assistance and, if he or she was not a recipient of
27 assistance, provide an original waiver of claim to the beneficiaries for the purposes
28 of recording the deed upon death.
29 7. For claims not originating with the [Department of Health and Human
30 Services,] Nevada Health Authority, if a claim is rejected by the beneficiary or
31 beneficiaries under the deed upon death, in whole or in part, the beneficiary or
32 beneficiaries must, within 10 days after the rejection, notify the claimant of the
33 rejection by written notice sent by registered or certified mail to the mailing address
34 of the claimant. The claimant must bring suit in the proper court against the
35 beneficiary or beneficiaries within 30 days after the notice is sent, whether the
36 claim is due or not, or the claim is barred forever and the beneficiary or
37 beneficiaries under the deed upon death may distribute the property transferred by
38 the deed upon death without personal liability to any creditor whose claim is barred
39 forever.
40 8. A title company that is engaged regarding the transfer of the property
41 identified in a deed upon death may recognize that the notices provided pursuant to
42 this section constitute adequate notice required by law. A title company is not liable
43 for claims of which the title company is not made aware by the beneficiaries.
44 9. A person dealing with a beneficiary of a deed upon death has the same
45 rights and protections as the person would have if the beneficiary had been named
46 as a distributee of the property in an order for distribution of the grantor’s estate
47 that had become final if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
48 (a) The person acted in good faith and for valuable consideration; and
49 (b) A Death of Grantor Affidavit was recorded pursuant to NRS 111.699.
50 Sec. 44. NRS 111.779 is hereby amended to read as follows:
51 111.779 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 21.090 and other
52 applicable law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is liable to the probate estate of

Senate Amendment No. 920 to Senate Bill No. 494 Page 35
1 the decedent for allowed claims against that decedent’s probate estate to the extent
2 the estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims.
3 2. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the value of
4 nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that transferee.
5 3. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency described in
6 subsection 1 in the following order of priority:
7 (a) A transferee specified in the decedent’s will or any other governing
8 instrument as being liable for such an insufficiency, in the order of priority
9 provided in the will or other governing instrument;
10 (b) The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate instrument in the
11 decedent’s estate plan as shown by its designation as devisee of the decedent’s
12 residuary estate or by other facts or circumstances, to the extent of the value of the
13 nonprobate transfer received or controlled; and
14 (c) Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values received.
15 4. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests of beneficiaries
16 in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section abate as necessary to satisfy the
17 liability, as if all the trust instruments were a single will and the interests were
18 devises under it.
19 5. If a nonprobate transferee is a spouse or a minor child, the nonprobate
20 transferee may petition the court to be excluded from the liability imposed by this
21 section as if the nonprobate property received by the spouse or minor child were
22 part of the decedent’s estate. Such a petition may be made pursuant to the
23 applicable provisions of chapter 146 of NRS, including, without limitation, the
24 provisions of NRS 146.010 and 146.020 and subsection 2 of NRS 146.070.
25 6. A provision made in one instrument may direct the apportionment of the
26 liability among the nonprobate transferees taking under that or any other governing
27 instrument. If a provision in one instrument conflicts with a provision in another,
28 the later one prevails.
29 7. Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability imposed by this
30 section is enforceable in probate proceedings in this State, whether or not the
31 transferee is located in this State.
32 8. If a probate proceeding is pending at the time of filing and it has been
33 determined by a final order issued by the probate court that there are insufficient
34 assets to pay a valid creditor, a proceeding under this section may be commenced
35 by one of the following persons:
36 (a) The personal representative of the decedent’s estate. A personal
37 representative who declines in good faith to commence a proceeding incurs no
38 personal liability for declining.
39 (b) A creditor of the estate, if the personal representative has declined or
40 refused to commence an action within 30 days after receiving a written demand by
41 a creditor. Such demand must identify the nonprobate transfers known to the
42 creditor. If the creditor is unaware of any nonprobate transfers, in the probate
43 proceeding, the creditor may, pursuant to NRS 155.170, obtain discovery,
44 perpetuate testimony or conduct examinations in any manner authorized by law or
45 by the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure to ascertain whether any nonprobate
46 transfers exist. If the creditor is unable to identify any nonprobate transfers within a
47 reasonable time after conducting discovery, the creditor may not proceed under this
48 section. If a creditor commences an action under this section:
49 (1) The creditor must proceed at the expense of the creditor and not of the
50 estate.
51 (2) If a creditor successfully establishes an entitlement to payment under
52 this section and collects nonprobate transfers, the court must order the
53 reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred by the creditor, including attorney’s

Senate Amendment No. 920 to Senate Bill No. 494 Page 36
1 fees, from the transferee from whom the payment is to be made, subject to the
2 limitations of subsection 2, or from the estate as a cost of administration, or
3 partially from each, as the court deems just.
4 9. If a probate proceeding is not pending, a proceeding under this section may
5 be commenced as a civil action by a creditor at the expense of the creditor.
6 10. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this section, it must be
7 commenced:
8 (a) If a probate proceeding is pending in which notice to creditors has been
9 given at the time of filing a proceeding under this section:
10 (1) As to a creditor whose claim was properly and timely filed, allowed by
11 the personal representative or partially allowed by the personal representative, and
12 accepted by the creditor pursuant to NRS 147.160, within 60 days after the probate
13 court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of the approved claim that
14 is final and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the
15 decedent’s death, whichever is later.
16 (2) As to a creditor:
17 (I) Whose claim was rejected by the personal representative, partially
18 allowed by the personal representative and rejected by the creditor pursuant to NRS
19 147.160, or deemed rejected by the personal representative pursuant to NRS
20 147.110;
21 (II) Who adjudicated the creditor’s claims in the proper court or by a
22 summary adjudication; and
23 (III) Who obtained a favorable final judgment on its claim from the
24 proper court,
25  within 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming the amount of
26 payment of the approved claim that is final and no longer subject to reconsideration
27 or appeal or within 1 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
28 (b) If an action had been commenced against the decedent before the
29 decedent’s death, the creditor receives a judgment against the decedent’s estate and
30 the creditor has filed a proper and timely creditor’s claim against the estate, within
31 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of
32 the adjudicated claim that is final and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal
33 or within 1 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
34 (c) As to the recovery of benefits paid for Medicaid, within 3 years after the
35 decedent’s death.
36 (d) As to all other creditors, within 1 year after the decedent’s death.
37 11. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent’s probate estate is
38 nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and statutory allowances has been
39 received from the decedent’s personal representative, the following rules apply:
40 (a) Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution, registrar or other
41 obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance with the terms of the governing
42 instrument controlling the transfer releases the obligor from all claims for amounts
43 paid or assets delivered.
44 (b) A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is released from
45 liability under this section with respect to any assets distributed to the trust’s
46 beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent of the distribution received becomes
47 liable for the amount of the trustee’s liability attributable to assets received by the
48 beneficiary.
49 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 13, notwithstanding any
50 provision of this section to the contrary:
51 (a) A creditor has no claim against:

Senate Amendment No. 920 to Senate Bill No. 494 Page 37

9 without limitation, an inherited individual retirement arrangement;
10 (II) A written simplified employee pension plan which conforms with

20 (V) A trust forming part of a qualified tuition program pursuant to
21 chapter 353B of NRS, any applicable regulations adopted pursuant to chapter 353B

24 owner or the money will not be used by any beneficiary to attend a college or
25 university.
26 (3) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation by a decedent
27 which transfers money, benefits or privileges that accrue in any manner out of life

36 (6) An irrevocable trust or amounts payable from a trust if the trust was
37 properly created as a valid spendthrift trust under chapter 166 of NRS, except with
38 respect to property transferred to the trust by the decedent to the extent permitted
39 under subsections 1, 2 and 3 of NRS 166.170.
40 (b) A purchaser for value of property or a lender who acquires a security
41 interest in the property from a beneficiary of a nonprobate transfer after the death of
42 the owner, in good faith:
43 (1) Takes the property free of any claims or of liability to the owner’s

7 Sec. 45. NRS 115.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 115.090 Nothing in this chapter exempts any real or personal property from

12 a lien against the property of a recipient of Medicaid in the manner set forth in NRS
13 422.29302, 422.29304 and 422.29306.

15 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a court of
16 competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by a spouse or the guardian
17 of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the income and resources of a married couple
18 pursuant to this section if one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other
19 spouse is a community spouse.
20 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is contrary to a
21 premarital agreement between the spouses which is enforceable pursuant to chapter

23 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may divide the
24 income and resources:

29 community spouse an amount which does not exceed the amount set forth in 42
30 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(ii).

32 greater than that otherwise provided under paragraph (b) of subsection 3, upon
33 finding exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress and
34 setting forth in writing the reasons for that finding, the court may enter an order for
35 support against the institutionalized spouse for the support of the community
36 spouse in an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is necessary.
37 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the community

42 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount so allowed or

3 separate income, assets and obligations of the spouses. Such an agreement is
4 effective only if one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
5 community spouse or a division of the income or resources would allow one spouse
6 to qualify for services under NRS 427A.250 to 427A.280, inclusive.

8 not be binding on the Medicaid Division of [Welfare and Supportive Services of

46 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed $100,000, the estate may
47 be set aside without administration by the order of the court; or
48 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s estate is to be
49 distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust established by the decedent and
50 in existence at the decedent’s death, the portion of the estate subject to such
51 direction may be set aside without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s
52 estate set aside to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
53 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the court that the

Senate Amendment No. 920 to Senate Bill No. 494 Page 41
1 trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to such creditors on behalf of
2 the nontestamentary trust and settlor pursuant to NRS 164.025.

12 (d) Any balance remaining to the claimant or claimants entitled thereto
13 pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no valid will, pursuant to
14 intestate succession in accordance with chapter 134 of NRS.
15 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed $100,000 and the decedent is
16 survived by a spouse or one or more minor children, the court must set aside the
17 estate for the benefit of the surviving spouse or the minor child or minor children of
18 the decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or 5. The court
19 may allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse, the entire amount to the
20 minor child or minor children, or may divide the estate among the surviving spouse
21 and minor child or minor children.
22 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or
23 minor child or minor children of the decedent pursuant to subsection 3, the court
24 must set aside the estate without the payment of creditors except as the court finds
25 necessary to prevent a manifest injustice.
26 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are nonprobate transfers that
27 already benefit the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the

37 condition of the patient, the expected benefits, if any, to the patient resulting from
38 the transfer and whether the risks to the patient’s health are outweighed by the
39 expected benefits, and must be documented in the patient’s records before the
