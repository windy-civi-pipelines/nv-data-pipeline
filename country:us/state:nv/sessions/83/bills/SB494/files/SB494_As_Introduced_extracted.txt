35 the mailing, for those required to be mailed, or 90 days after
36 publication of the first notice to creditors pursuant to subsection 3.
37 Any claim against a grantor or the probate estate of a grantor, as
38 applicable, not filed within that time is forever barred. After the
39 expiration of the time to file a claim as provided in this section, the
40 beneficiary or beneficiaries may sell or distribute the property
41 transferred pursuant to the deed upon death, without personal
42 liability for any claim which has not been timely filed with the
43 beneficiary or beneficiaries if, in accordance with subsection 6, the
44 beneficiary or beneficiaries have received a waiver of claim after
-
*SB494*
– 42 –
1 providing written notice to the [Department of Health and Human
2 Services] Nevada Health Authority as required by subsection 3.
3 6. If notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
4 Nevada Health Authority is not given, the property transferred by
5 the deed upon death remains subject to the right of the [Department]
6 Authority to recover public assistance received by the grantor. The
7 [Department] Authority may initiate an action to impose a lien on
8 the real property transferred by the deed upon death pursuant to
9 NRS 422.29306, take any other action allowable by law to secure
10 the future recovery of benefits or make a written demand for
11 payment, as applicable. The [Department] Authority shall notify the
12 beneficiary or beneficiaries in writing within 45 days after receipt of
13 a notice pursuant to subsection 3 whether the grantor was a recipient
14 of public assistance and, if he or she was not a recipient of
15 assistance, provide an original waiver of claim to the beneficiaries
16 for the purposes of recording the deed upon death.
17 7. For claims not originating with the [Department of Health
18 and Human Services,] Nevada Health Authority, if a claim is
19 rejected by the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon
20 death, in whole or in part, the beneficiary or beneficiaries must,
21 within 10 days after the rejection, notify the claimant of the
22 rejection by written notice sent by registered or certified mail to
23 the mailing address of the claimant. The claimant must bring suit in
24 the proper court against the beneficiary or beneficiaries within 30
25 days after the notice is sent, whether the claim is due or not, or the
26 claim is barred forever and the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the
27 deed upon death may distribute the property transferred by the deed
28 upon death without personal liability to any creditor whose claim is
29 barred forever.
30 8. A title company that is engaged regarding the transfer of the
31 property identified in a deed upon death may recognize that the
32 notices provided pursuant to this section constitute adequate notice
33 required by law. A title company is not liable for claims of which
34 the title company is not made aware by the beneficiaries.
35 9. A person dealing with a beneficiary of a deed upon death has
36 the same rights and protections as the person would have if the
37 beneficiary had been named as a distributee of the property in an
38 order for distribution of the grantor’s estate that had become final if
39 both of the following conditions are satisfied:
40 (a) The person acted in good faith and for valuable
41 consideration; and
42 (b) A Death of Grantor Affidavit was recorded pursuant to
43 NRS 111.699.

1 Sec. 44. NRS 111.779 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 111.779 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 21.090 and
3 other applicable law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is liable to
4 the probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that
5 decedent’s probate estate to the extent the estate is insufficient to
6 satisfy those claims.
7 2. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the
8 value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that
9 transferee.
10 3. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency
11 described in subsection 1 in the following order of priority:
12 (a) A transferee specified in the decedent’s will or any other
13 governing instrument as being liable for such an insufficiency, in the
14 order of priority provided in the will or other governing instrument;
15 (b) The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate
16 instrument in the decedent’s estate plan as shown by its designation
17 as devisee of the decedent’s residuary estate or by other facts or
18 circumstances, to the extent of the value of the nonprobate transfer
19 received or controlled; and
20 (c) Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values
21 received.
22 4. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests
23 of beneficiaries in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section
24 abate as necessary to satisfy the liability, as if all the trust
25 instruments were a single will and the interests were devises under
26 it.
27 5. If a nonprobate transferee is a spouse or a minor child, the
28 nonprobate transferee may petition the court to be excluded from the
29 liability imposed by this section as if the nonprobate property
30 received by the spouse or minor child were part of the decedent’s
31 estate. Such a petition may be made pursuant to the applicable
32 provisions of chapter 146 of NRS, including, without limitation, the
33 provisions of NRS 146.010 and 146.020 and subsection 2 of
34 NRS 146.070.
35 6. A provision made in one instrument may direct the
36 apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees
37 taking under that or any other governing instrument. If a provision
38 in one instrument conflicts with a provision in another, the later one
39 prevails.
40 7. Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability
41 imposed by this section is enforceable in probate proceedings in this
42 State, whether or not the transferee is located in this State.
43 8. If a probate proceeding is pending at the time of filing and it
44 has been determined by a final order issued by the probate court that
45 there are insufficient assets to pay a valid creditor, a proceeding
-
*SB494*
– 44 –
1 under this section may be commenced by one of the following
2 persons:
3 (a) The personal representative of the decedent’s estate. A
4 personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a
5 proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.
6 (b) A creditor of the estate, if the personal representative has
7 declined or refused to commence an action within 30 days after
8 receiving a written demand by a creditor. Such demand must
9 identify the nonprobate transfers known to the creditor. If the
10 creditor is unaware of any nonprobate transfers, in the probate
11 proceeding, the creditor may, pursuant to NRS 155.170, obtain
12 discovery, perpetuate testimony or conduct examinations in any
13 manner authorized by law or by the Nevada Rules of Civil
14 Procedure to ascertain whether any nonprobate transfers exist. If the
15 creditor is unable to identify any nonprobate transfers within a
16 reasonable time after conducting discovery, the creditor may not
17 proceed under this section. If a creditor commences an action under
18 this section:
19 (1) The creditor must proceed at the expense of the creditor
20 and not of the estate.
21 (2) If a creditor successfully establishes an entitlement to
22 payment under this section and collects nonprobate transfers, the
23 court must order the reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred
24 by the creditor, including attorney’s fees, from the transferee from
25 whom the payment is to be made, subject to the limitations of
26 subsection 2, or from the estate as a cost of administration, or
27 partially from each, as the court deems just.
28 9. If a probate proceeding is not pending, a proceeding under
29 this section may be commenced as a civil action by a creditor at the
30 expense of the creditor.
31 10. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this section, it
32 must be commenced:
33 (a) If a probate proceeding is pending in which notice to
34 creditors has been given at the time of filing a proceeding under this
35 section:
36 (1) As to a creditor whose claim was properly and timely
37 filed, allowed by the personal representative or partially allowed by
38 the personal representative, and accepted by the creditor pursuant to
39 NRS 147.160, within 60 days after the probate court enters an order
40 confirming the amount of payment of the approved claim that is
41 final and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1
42 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
43 (2) As to a creditor:
44 (I) Whose claim was rejected by the personal
45 representative, partially allowed by the personal representative and
-
*SB494*
– 45 –
1 rejected by the creditor pursuant to NRS 147.160, or deemed
2 rejected by the personal representative pursuant to NRS 147.110;
3 (II) Who adjudicated the creditor’s claims in the proper
4 court or by a summary adjudication; and
5 (III) Who obtained a favorable final judgment on its claim
6 from the proper court,
7  within 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming
8 the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final and no
9 longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the
10 decedent’s death, whichever is later.
11 (b) If an action had been commenced against the decedent
12 before the decedent’s death, the creditor receives a judgment against
13 the decedent’s estate and the creditor has filed a proper and timely
14 creditor’s claim against the estate, within 60 days after the probate
15 court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of the
16 adjudicated claim that is final and no longer subject to
17 reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the decedent’s death,
18 whichever is later.
19 (c) As to the recovery of benefits paid for Medicaid, within 3
20 years after the decedent’s death.
21 (d) As to all other creditors, within 1 year after the decedent’s
22 death.
23 11. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent’s probate
24 estate is nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and
25 statutory allowances has been received from the decedent’s personal
26 representative, the following rules apply:
27 (a) Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution,
28 registrar or other obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance
29 with the terms of the governing instrument controlling the transfer
30 releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets
31 delivered.
32 (b) A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is
33 released from liability under this section with respect to any assets
34 distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent
35 of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the
36 trustee’s liability attributable to assets received by the beneficiary.
37 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 13,
38 notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
39 (a) A creditor has no claim against:
40 (1) Property transferred pursuant to a power of appointment
41 exercised by a decedent unless the power of appointment was
42 actually exercised in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate.
43 (2) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
44 by a decedent which transfers money held by any of the following:
-
*SB494*

1 (I) An individual retirement arrangement which conforms
2 with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable limitations and
3 requirements of section 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code,
4 26 U.S.C. §§ 408 and 408A, including, without limitation, an
5 inherited individual retirement arrangement;
6 (II) A written simplified employee pension plan which
7 conforms with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable

15 (IV) A trust forming part of a stock bonus, pension or
16 profit-sharing plan which is qualified and maintained pursuant to
17 sections 401 et seq. of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 401
18 et seq.; and
19 (V) A trust forming part of a qualified tuition program
20 pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS, any applicable regulations
21 adopted pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS and section 529 of the
22 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 529, unless the money is
23 deposited after the entry of a judgment against the purchaser or
24 account owner or the money will not be used by any beneficiary to
25 attend a college or university.
26 (3) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
27 by a decedent which transfers money, benefits or privileges that
28 accrue in any manner out of life insurance.
29 (4) Proceeds of any wages of the decedent which were
30 exempt from execution during the decedent’s lifetime pursuant to
31 paragraph (g) of subsection 1 of NRS 21.090.
32 (5) A trust, a beneficial interest of the decedent under a trust
33 or amount payable from a trust if the trust was created by someone
34 other than the decedent, except to enforce a valid assignment of the
35 decedent’s beneficial interest under a trust that is not a spendthrift
36 trust.
37 (6) An irrevocable trust or amounts payable from a trust if
38 the trust was properly created as a valid spendthrift trust under
39 chapter 166 of NRS, except with respect to property transferred to
40 the trust by the decedent to the extent permitted under subsections 1,
41 2 and 3 of NRS 166.170.
42 (b) A purchaser for value of property or a lender who acquires a

*SB494*
– 47 –
1 (1) Takes the property free of any claims or of liability to the
2 owner’s estate, creditors of the owner’s estate, persons claiming

11 not relieve a purchaser or lender from the notice imparted by
12 instruments of record respecting the property.
13 13. Nothing in this section exempts any real or personal
14 property from any statute of this State that authorizes the recovery
15 of money owed to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
16 Nevada Health Authority as a result of the payment of benefits
17 from Medicaid.
18 14. As used in this section, “devise” has the meaning ascribed
19 to it in NRS 132.095.
20 Sec. 45. NRS 115.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 115.090 Nothing in this chapter exempts any real or personal
22 property from any statute of this State that authorizes the recovery
23 of money owed to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
24 Nevada Health Authority as a result of the payment of benefits
25 from Medicaid through the imposition or foreclosure of a lien
26 against the property of a recipient of Medicaid in the manner set
27 forth in NRS 422.29302, 422.29304 and 422.29306.
28 Sec. 46. NRS 123.259 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
30 court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by
31 a spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the
32 income and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if
33 one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
34 community spouse.
35 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
36 contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
37 enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
38 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
39 divide the income and resources:
40 (a) Equally between the spouses; or
41 (b) By protecting income for the community spouse through
42 application of the maximum federal minimum monthly maintenance
43 needs allowance set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(d)(3)(C) and by
44 permitting a transfer of resources to the community spouse an
-
*SB494*
– 48 –
1 amount which does not exceed the amount set forth in 42 U.S.C. §
2 1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(ii).
3 4. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs
4 income greater than that otherwise provided under paragraph (b) of
5 subsection 3, upon finding exceptional circumstances resulting in
6 significant financial duress and setting forth in writing the reasons
7 for that finding, the court may enter an order for support against the
8 institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse in
9 an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is
10 necessary.
11 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
12 community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
13 relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
14 inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
15 amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
16 support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
17 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount
18 so allowed or to fund the order for support.
19 6. A copy of a petition for relief under subsection 4 or 5 and
20 any court order issued pursuant to such a petition must be served on
21 the Administrator of the Division of [Welfare and Supportive]
22 Social Services of the Department of [Health and] Human Services

25 later than 45 days after receipt by the Division of [Welfare and
26 Supportive] Social Services of the Department of [Health and]
27 Human Services of an application for medical assistance and a copy

29 and may move to modify the order.
30 7. A person may enter into a written agreement with his or her
31 spouse dividing their community income, assets and obligations into
32 equal shares of separate income, assets and obligations of the
33 spouses. Such an agreement is effective only if one spouse is an
34 institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a community spouse
35 or a division of the income or resources would allow one spouse to
36 qualify for services under NRS 427A.250 to 427A.280, inclusive.
37 8. An agreement entered into or decree entered pursuant to this
38 section may not be binding on the Medicaid Division of [Welfare
39 and Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human
40 Services] the Nevada Health Authority in making determinations
41 under the State Plan for Medicaid.
42 9. As used in this section, “community spouse” and
43 “institutionalized spouse” have the meanings respectively ascribed
44 to them in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(h).

20 minor child or minor children, including any assets received by or
21 for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
22 children from the decedent by nonprobate transfers.

27 child or minor children.

32 5. A person or entity having a claim, due or to become due,
33 against a grantor or his or her probate estate, as applicable, must file
34 the claim with the beneficiary or beneficiaries within 90 days after
35 the mailing, for those required to be mailed, or 90 days after
36 publication of the first notice to creditors pursuant to subsection 3.
37 Any claim against a grantor or the probate estate of a grantor, as
38 applicable, not filed within that time is forever barred. After the
39 expiration of the time to file a claim as provided in this section, the
40 beneficiary or beneficiaries may sell or distribute the property
41 transferred pursuant to the deed upon death, without personal
42 liability for any claim which has not been timely filed with the
43 beneficiary or beneficiaries if, in accordance with subsection 6, the
44 beneficiary or beneficiaries have received a waiver of claim after
-
*SB494*

– 42 –
1 providing written notice to the [Department of Health and Human
2 Services] Nevada Health Authority as required by subsection 3.
3 6. If notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
4 Nevada Health Authority is not given, the property transferred by
5 the deed upon death remains subject to the right of the [Department]
6 Authority to recover public assistance received by the grantor. The
7 [Department] Authority may initiate an action to impose a lien on
8 the real property transferred by the deed upon death pursuant to
9 NRS 422.29306, take any other action allowable by law to secure
10 the future recovery of benefits or make a written demand for
11 payment, as applicable. The [Department] Authority shall notify the
12 beneficiary or beneficiaries in writing within 45 days after receipt of
13 a notice pursuant to subsection 3 whether the grantor was a recipient
14 of public assistance and, if he or she was not a recipient of
15 assistance, provide an original waiver of claim to the beneficiaries
16 for the purposes of recording the deed upon death.
17 7. For claims not originating with the [Department of Health
18 and Human Services,] Nevada Health Authority, if a claim is
19 rejected by the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon
20 death, in whole or in part, the beneficiary or beneficiaries must,
21 within 10 days after the rejection, notify the claimant of the
22 rejection by written notice sent by registered or certified mail to
23 the mailing address of the claimant. The claimant must bring suit in
24 the proper court against the beneficiary or beneficiaries within 30
25 days after the notice is sent, whether the claim is due or not, or the
26 claim is barred forever and the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the
27 deed upon death may distribute the property transferred by the deed
28 upon death without personal liability to any creditor whose claim is
29 barred forever.
30 8. A title company that is engaged regarding the transfer of the
31 property identified in a deed upon death may recognize that the
32 notices provided pursuant to this section constitute adequate notice
33 required by law. A title company is not liable for claims of which
34 the title company is not made aware by the beneficiaries.
35 9. A person dealing with a beneficiary of a deed upon death has
36 the same rights and protections as the person would have if the
37 beneficiary had been named as a distributee of the property in an
38 order for distribution of the grantor’s estate that had become final if
39 both of the following conditions are satisfied:
40 (a) The person acted in good faith and for valuable
41 consideration; and
42 (b) A Death of Grantor Affidavit was recorded pursuant to
43 NRS 111.699.

1 Sec. 44. NRS 111.779 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 111.779 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 21.090 and
3 other applicable law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is liable to
4 the probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that
5 decedent’s probate estate to the extent the estate is insufficient to
6 satisfy those claims.
7 2. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the
8 value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that
9 transferee.
10 3. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency
11 described in subsection 1 in the following order of priority:
12 (a) A transferee specified in the decedent’s will or any other
13 governing instrument as being liable for such an insufficiency, in the
14 order of priority provided in the will or other governing instrument;
15 (b) The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate
16 instrument in the decedent’s estate plan as shown by its designation
17 as devisee of the decedent’s residuary estate or by other facts or
18 circumstances, to the extent of the value of the nonprobate transfer
19 received or controlled; and
20 (c) Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values
21 received.
22 4. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests
23 of beneficiaries in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section
24 abate as necessary to satisfy the liability, as if all the trust
25 instruments were a single will and the interests were devises under
26 it.
27 5. If a nonprobate transferee is a spouse or a minor child, the
28 nonprobate transferee may petition the court to be excluded from the
29 liability imposed by this section as if the nonprobate property
30 received by the spouse or minor child were part of the decedent’s
31 estate. Such a petition may be made pursuant to the applicable
32 provisions of chapter 146 of NRS, including, without limitation, the
33 provisions of NRS 146.010 and 146.020 and subsection 2 of
34 NRS 146.070.
35 6. A provision made in one instrument may direct the
36 apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees
37 taking under that or any other governing instrument. If a provision
38 in one instrument conflicts with a provision in another, the later one
39 prevails.
40 7. Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability
41 imposed by this section is enforceable in probate proceedings in this
42 State, whether or not the transferee is located in this State.
43 8. If a probate proceeding is pending at the time of filing and it
44 has been determined by a final order issued by the probate court that
45 there are insufficient assets to pay a valid creditor, a proceeding
-
*SB494*

– 44 –
1 under this section may be commenced by one of the following
2 persons:
3 (a) The personal representative of the decedent’s estate. A
4 personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a
5 proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.
6 (b) A creditor of the estate, if the personal representative has
7 declined or refused to commence an action within 30 days after
8 receiving a written demand by a creditor. Such demand must
9 identify the nonprobate transfers known to the creditor. If the
10 creditor is unaware of any nonprobate transfers, in the probate
11 proceeding, the creditor may, pursuant to NRS 155.170, obtain
12 discovery, perpetuate testimony or conduct examinations in any
13 manner authorized by law or by the Nevada Rules of Civil
14 Procedure to ascertain whether any nonprobate transfers exist. If the
15 creditor is unable to identify any nonprobate transfers within a
16 reasonable time after conducting discovery, the creditor may not
17 proceed under this section. If a creditor commences an action under
18 this section:
19 (1) The creditor must proceed at the expense of the creditor
20 and not of the estate.
21 (2) If a creditor successfully establishes an entitlement to
22 payment under this section and collects nonprobate transfers, the
23 court must order the reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred
24 by the creditor, including attorney’s fees, from the transferee from
25 whom the payment is to be made, subject to the limitations of
26 subsection 2, or from the estate as a cost of administration, or
27 partially from each, as the court deems just.
28 9. If a probate proceeding is not pending, a proceeding under
29 this section may be commenced as a civil action by a creditor at the
30 expense of the creditor.
31 10. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this section, it
32 must be commenced:
33 (a) If a probate proceeding is pending in which notice to
34 creditors has been given at the time of filing a proceeding under this
35 section:
36 (1) As to a creditor whose claim was properly and timely
37 filed, allowed by the personal representative or partially allowed by
38 the personal representative, and accepted by the creditor pursuant to
39 NRS 147.160, within 60 days after the probate court enters an order
40 confirming the amount of payment of the approved claim that is
41 final and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1
42 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
43 (2) As to a creditor:
44 (I) Whose claim was rejected by the personal
45 representative, partially allowed by the personal representative and
-
*SB494*

– 45 –
1 rejected by the creditor pursuant to NRS 147.160, or deemed
2 rejected by the personal representative pursuant to NRS 147.110;
3 (II) Who adjudicated the creditor’s claims in the proper
4 court or by a summary adjudication; and
5 (III) Who obtained a favorable final judgment on its claim
6 from the proper court,
7  within 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming
8 the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final and no
9 longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the
10 decedent’s death, whichever is later.
11 (b) If an action had been commenced against the decedent
12 before the decedent’s death, the creditor receives a judgment against
13 the decedent’s estate and the creditor has filed a proper and timely
14 creditor’s claim against the estate, within 60 days after the probate
15 court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of the
16 adjudicated claim that is final and no longer subject to
17 reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the decedent’s death,
18 whichever is later.
19 (c) As to the recovery of benefits paid for Medicaid, within 3
20 years after the decedent’s death.
21 (d) As to all other creditors, within 1 year after the decedent’s
22 death.
23 11. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent’s probate
24 estate is nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and
25 statutory allowances has been received from the decedent’s personal
26 representative, the following rules apply:
27 (a) Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution,
28 registrar or other obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance
29 with the terms of the governing instrument controlling the transfer
30 releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets
31 delivered.
32 (b) A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is
33 released from liability under this section with respect to any assets
34 distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent
35 of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the
36 trustee’s liability attributable to assets received by the beneficiary.
37 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 13,
38 notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
39 (a) A creditor has no claim against:
40 (1) Property transferred pursuant to a power of appointment
41 exercised by a decedent unless the power of appointment was
42 actually exercised in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate.
43 (2) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
44 by a decedent which transfers money held by any of the following:
-
*SB494*

2 with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable limitations and
3 requirements of section 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code,
4 26 U.S.C. §§ 408 and 408A, including, without limitation, an
5 inherited individual retirement arrangement;
6 (II) A written simplified employee pension plan which

17 sections 401 et seq. of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 401

19 (V) A trust forming part of a qualified tuition program

22 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 529, unless the money is
23 deposited after the entry of a judgment against the purchaser or
24 account owner or the money will not be used by any beneficiary to
25 attend a college or university.
26 (3) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
27 by a decedent which transfers money, benefits or privileges that
28 accrue in any manner out of life insurance.

32 (5) A trust, a beneficial interest of the decedent under a trust
33 or amount payable from a trust if the trust was created by someone
34 other than the decedent, except to enforce a valid assignment of the
35 decedent’s beneficial interest under a trust that is not a spendthrift
36 trust.
37 (6) An irrevocable trust or amounts payable from a trust if
38 the trust was properly created as a valid spendthrift trust under
39 chapter 166 of NRS, except with respect to property transferred to
40 the trust by the decedent to the extent permitted under subsections 1,
41 2 and 3 of NRS 166.170.
42 (b) A purchaser for value of property or a lender who acquires a

1 (1) Takes the property free of any claims or of liability to the
2 owner’s estate, creditors of the owner’s estate, persons claiming

11 not relieve a purchaser or lender from the notice imparted by
12 instruments of record respecting the property.
13 13. Nothing in this section exempts any real or personal
14 property from any statute of this State that authorizes the recovery
15 of money owed to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
16 Nevada Health Authority as a result of the payment of benefits
17 from Medicaid.
18 14. As used in this section, “devise” has the meaning ascribed
19 to it in NRS 132.095.
20 Sec. 45. NRS 115.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 115.090 Nothing in this chapter exempts any real or personal
22 property from any statute of this State that authorizes the recovery
23 of money owed to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
24 Nevada Health Authority as a result of the payment of benefits
25 from Medicaid through the imposition or foreclosure of a lien
26 against the property of a recipient of Medicaid in the manner set
27 forth in NRS 422.29302, 422.29304 and 422.29306.
28 Sec. 46. NRS 123.259 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
30 court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by
31 a spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the
32 income and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if
33 one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
34 community spouse.
35 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
36 contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
37 enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
38 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
39 divide the income and resources:
40 (a) Equally between the spouses; or
41 (b) By protecting income for the community spouse through
42 application of the maximum federal minimum monthly maintenance
43 needs allowance set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(d)(3)(C) and by
44 permitting a transfer of resources to the community spouse an
-
*SB494*

– 48 –
1 amount which does not exceed the amount set forth in 42 U.S.C. §
2 1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(ii).
3 4. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs
4 income greater than that otherwise provided under paragraph (b) of
5 subsection 3, upon finding exceptional circumstances resulting in
6 significant financial duress and setting forth in writing the reasons
7 for that finding, the court may enter an order for support against the
8 institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse in
9 an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is
10 necessary.
11 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
12 community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
13 relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
14 inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
15 amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
16 support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
17 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount
18 so allowed or to fund the order for support.
19 6. A copy of a petition for relief under subsection 4 or 5 and
20 any court order issued pursuant to such a petition must be served on
21 the Administrator of the Division of [Welfare and Supportive]

30 7. A person may enter into a written agreement with his or her
31 spouse dividing their community income, assets and obligations into
32 equal shares of separate income, assets and obligations of the
33 spouses. Such an agreement is effective only if one spouse is an
34 institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a community spouse
35 or a division of the income or resources would allow one spouse to
36 qualify for services under NRS 427A.250 to 427A.280, inclusive.
37 8. An agreement entered into or decree entered pursuant to this
38 section may not be binding on the Medicaid Division of [Welfare
39 and Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human
40 Services] the Nevada Health Authority in making determinations
41 under the State Plan for Medicaid.

13 146.070 1. All or part of the estate of a decedent may be set
14 aside without administration by the order of the court as follows:
15 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed $100,000,
16 the estate may be set aside without administration by the order of
17 the court; or
18 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s
19 estate is to be distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust
20 established by the decedent and in existence at the decedent’s death,
21 the portion of the estate subject to such direction may be set aside
22 without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s estate set aside
23 to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
24 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the
25 court that the trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to
26 such creditors on behalf of the nontestamentary trust and settlor
27 pursuant to NRS 164.025.
28 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the whole
29 estate set aside pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 must be

31 (a) To the payment of the petitioner’s attorney’s fees and costs
32 incurred relative to the proceeding under this section;
33 (b) To the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of last illness,

39 thereto pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no
40 valid will, pursuant to intestate succession in accordance with
41 chapter 134 of NRS.
42 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed $100,000 and the
43 decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more minor children, the
44 court must set aside the estate for the benefit of the surviving spouse
45 or the minor child or minor children of the decedent, subject to any
-
*SB494*

– 52 –
1 reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or 5. The court may
2 allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse, the entire amount
3 to the minor child or minor children, or may divide the estate among
4 the surviving spouse and minor child or minor children.
5 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the
6 surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the decedent
7 pursuant to subsection 3, the court must set aside the estate without
8 the payment of creditors except as the court finds necessary to
9 prevent a manifest injustice.
10 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are
11 nonprobate transfers that already benefit the surviving spouse or
12 minor child or minor children of the decedent, the court has the
13 discretion to reduce the amount set aside under subsection 3 to the
14 extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value of
15 nonprobate transfers, as defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent
16 to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
17 children of the decedent exceeds $100,000.
18 6. In exercising the discretion granted in this section, the court
19 shall consider the needs and resources of the surviving spouse and
20 minor child or minor children, including any assets received by or
21 for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
22 children from the decedent by nonprobate transfers.
23 7. For the purpose of this section, a nonprobate transfer from
24 the decedent to one or more trusts or custodial accounts for the
25 benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children
26 shall be considered a transfer for the benefit of such spouse or minor
27 child or minor children.
28 8. Proceedings taken under this section must not begin until at
29 least 30 days after the death of the decedent and must be originated
30 by a petition containing:
31 (a) A specific description of all property in the decedent’s estate;
32 (b) A list of all known liens and encumbrances against estate
33 property at the date of the decedent’s death, with a description of
34 any that the petitioner believes may be unenforceable;
35 (c) An estimate of the value of the property, together with an
36 explanation of how the estimated value was determined;
37 (d) A statement of the debts of the decedent so far as known to
38 the petitioner;
39 (e) The names and residences of the heirs and devisees of the
40 decedent and the age of any who is a minor and the relationship of
41 the heirs and devisees to the decedent, so far as known to the
42 petitioner; and

44 evidence known to the petitioner that tends to prove that the will is
45 valid.

2 benefit of the decedent’s surviving spouse or minor child or minor
3 children without payment to creditors, the petition must also
4 contain:
5 (a) A specific description and estimated value of property
6 passing by one or more nonprobate transfers from the decedent to
7 the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children; or

9 to be set aside, combined with the value of all nonprobate transfers
10 from the decedent to the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
11 children who are seeking to receive property pursuant to this
12 section, is less than $100,000.
13 10. When property is distributed pursuant to an order granted
14 under this section, the court may allocate the property on a pro rata
15 basis or a non-pro rata basis.
16 11. The clerk shall set the petition for hearing and the
17 petitioner shall give notice of the petition and hearing in the manner
18 provided in NRS 155.010 to the decedent’s heirs and devisees and
19 to the Director of the [Department of Health and Human Services.]
20 Nevada Health Authority. If a complete copy of the petition is not
21 enclosed with the notice, the notice must include a statement setting
22 forth to whom the estate is being set aside.
23 12. No court or clerk’s fees may be charged for the filing of
24 any petition in, or order of court thereon, or for any certified copy of
25 the petition or order in an estate not exceeding $2,500 in value.
26 13. At the hearing on a petition under this section, the court
27 may require such additional evidence as the court deems necessary
28 to make the findings required under subsection 14.
29 14. The order granting the petition shall include:
30 (a) The court’s finding as to the validity of any will presented;

39 (e) The name of each distributee and the property to be
40 distributed to the distributee.
41 15. As to the distribution of the share of a minor child set aside
42 pursuant to this section, the court may direct the manner in which
43 the money may be used for the benefit of the minor child as is
44 deemed in the court’s discretion to be in the best interests of the
45 minor child, and the distribution of the minor child’s share shall be
-
*SB494*

– 54 –
1 made as permitted for the minor child’s share under the terms of the
2 decedent’s will or to one or more of the following:
3 (a) A parent of such minor child, with or without the filing of
4 any bond;
5 (b) A custodian under chapter 167 of NRS; or
6 (c) A court-appointed guardian of the estate, with or without

10 protect any interested person of the estate:
11 (a) May order that any asset assigned and set apart pursuant to
12 subsection 2 be distributed first to a designated person who resides
13 in this State and is otherwise qualified pursuant to NRS 139.010;
14 (b) May order the designated person to distribute the assets to
15 the person or persons entitled thereto; and

19 of the estate has been distributed to the persons entitled thereto and
20 all acts lawfully required have been performed.
21 17. For the purposes of this section, the value of property must
22 be the fair market value of that property, reduced by the value of all
23 enforceable liens and encumbrances. Property values and the values
24 of liens and encumbrances must be determined as of the date of the
25 decedent’s death.
26 Sec. 49. NRS 146.080 is hereby amended to read as follows:
