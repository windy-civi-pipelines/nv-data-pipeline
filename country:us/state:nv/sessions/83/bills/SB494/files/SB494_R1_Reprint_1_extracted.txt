27 Sec. 43. NRS 111.689 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 111.689 1. To the extent the grantor’s probate estate is
29 insufficient to satisfy an allowed claim against the estate or a statutory

10 ......... day of ............................., ............, and that said
11 grantor(s) had a date of birth of the ......... day of

18
19 Beneficiary or Beneficiaries: ...............................
20 Address: ...............................................................
21 ...............................................................
22
23 5. A person or entity having a claim, due or to become due,
24 against a grantor or his or her probate estate, as applicable, must file
25 the claim with the beneficiary or beneficiaries within 90 days after
26 the mailing, for those required to be mailed, or 90 days after
27 publication of the first notice to creditors pursuant to subsection 3.
28 Any claim against a grantor or the probate estate of a grantor, as
29 applicable, not filed within that time is forever barred. After the
30 expiration of the time to file a claim as provided in this section, the
31 beneficiary or beneficiaries may sell or distribute the property
32 transferred pursuant to the deed upon death, without personal liability
33 for any claim which has not been timely filed with the beneficiary or
34 beneficiaries if, in accordance with subsection 6, the beneficiary or
35 beneficiaries have received a waiver of claim after providing written
36 notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services] Nevada
37 Health Authority as required by subsection 3.
38 6. If notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
39 Nevada Health Authority is not given, the property transferred by the
40 deed upon death remains subject to the right of the [Department]
41 Authority to recover public assistance received by the grantor. The
42 [Department] Authority may initiate an action to impose a lien on the
43 real property transferred by the deed upon death pursuant to NRS
44 422.29306, take any other action allowable by law to secure the future
45 recovery of benefits or make a written demand for payment, as
-
*SB494_R1*
– 43 –
1 applicable. The [Department] Authority shall notify the beneficiary
2 or beneficiaries in writing within 45 days after receipt of a notice
3 pursuant to subsection 3 whether the grantor was a recipient of public
4 assistance and, if he or she was not a recipient of assistance, provide
5 an original waiver of claim to the beneficiaries for the purposes of
6 recording the deed upon death.
7 7. For claims not originating with the [Department of Health and
8 Human Services,] Nevada Health Authority, if a claim is rejected by
9 the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon death, in whole
10 or in part, the beneficiary or beneficiaries must, within 10 days after
11 the rejection, notify the claimant of the rejection by written notice
12 sent by registered or certified mail to the mailing address of the
13 claimant. The claimant must bring suit in the proper court against the
14 beneficiary or beneficiaries within 30 days after the notice is sent,
15 whether the claim is due or not, or the claim is barred forever and the
16 beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon death may distribute
17 the property transferred by the deed upon death without personal
18 liability to any creditor whose claim is barred forever.
19 8. A title company that is engaged regarding the transfer of the
20 property identified in a deed upon death may recognize that the
21 notices provided pursuant to this section constitute adequate notice
22 required by law. A title company is not liable for claims of which the
23 title company is not made aware by the beneficiaries.
24 9. A person dealing with a beneficiary of a deed upon death has
25 the same rights and protections as the person would have if the
26 beneficiary had been named as a distributee of the property in an order
27 for distribution of the grantor’s estate that had become final if both of
28 the following conditions are satisfied:
29 (a) The person acted in good faith and for valuable consideration;
30 and
31 (b) A Death of Grantor Affidavit was recorded pursuant to
32 NRS 111.699.
33 Sec. 44. NRS 111.779 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 111.779 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 21.090 and
35 other applicable law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is liable to
36 the probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that
37 decedent’s probate estate to the extent the estate is insufficient to
38 satisfy those claims.
39 2. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the
40 value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that
41 transferee.
42 3. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency
43 described in subsection 1 in the following order of priority:
-
*SB494_R1*
– 44 –
1 (a) A transferee specified in the decedent’s will or any other
2 governing instrument as being liable for such an insufficiency, in the
3 order of priority provided in the will or other governing instrument;
4 (b) The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate
5 instrument in the decedent’s estate plan as shown by its designation
6 as devisee of the decedent’s residuary estate or by other facts or
7 circumstances, to the extent of the value of the nonprobate transfer
8 received or controlled; and
9 (c) Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values
10 received.
11 4. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests of
12 beneficiaries in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section abate
13 as necessary to satisfy the liability, as if all the trust instruments were
14 a single will and the interests were devises under it.
15 5. If a nonprobate transferee is a spouse or a minor child, the
16 nonprobate transferee may petition the court to be excluded from the
17 liability imposed by this section as if the nonprobate property
18 received by the spouse or minor child were part of the decedent’s
19 estate. Such a petition may be made pursuant to the applicable
20 provisions of chapter 146 of NRS, including, without limitation, the
21 provisions of NRS 146.010 and 146.020 and subsection 2 of
22 NRS 146.070.
23 6. A provision made in one instrument may direct the
24 apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees
25 taking under that or any other governing instrument. If a provision in
26 one instrument conflicts with a provision in another, the later one
27 prevails.
28 7. Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability
29 imposed by this section is enforceable in probate proceedings in this
30 State, whether or not the transferee is located in this State.
31 8. If a probate proceeding is pending at the time of filing and it
32 has been determined by a final order issued by the probate court that
33 there are insufficient assets to pay a valid creditor, a proceeding under
34 this section may be commenced by one of the following persons:
35 (a) The personal representative of the decedent’s estate. A
36 personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a
37 proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.
38 (b) A creditor of the estate, if the personal representative has
39 declined or refused to commence an action within 30 days after
40 receiving a written demand by a creditor. Such demand must identify
41 the nonprobate transfers known to the creditor. If the creditor is
42 unaware of any nonprobate transfers, in the probate proceeding, the
43 creditor may, pursuant to NRS 155.170, obtain discovery, perpetuate
44 testimony or conduct examinations in any manner authorized by law
45 or by the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure to ascertain whether any
-
*SB494_R1*
– 45 –
1 nonprobate transfers exist. If the creditor is unable to identify any
2 nonprobate transfers within a reasonable time after conducting
3 discovery, the creditor may not proceed under this section. If a
4 creditor commences an action under this section:
5 (1) The creditor must proceed at the expense of the creditor
6 and not of the estate.
7 (2) If a creditor successfully establishes an entitlement to
8 payment under this section and collects nonprobate transfers, the
9 court must order the reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred
10 by the creditor, including attorney’s fees, from the transferee from
11 whom the payment is to be made, subject to the limitations of
12 subsection 2, or from the estate as a cost of administration, or partially
13 from each, as the court deems just.
14 9. If a probate proceeding is not pending, a proceeding under
15 this section may be commenced as a civil action by a creditor at the
16 expense of the creditor.
17 10. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this section, it
18 must be commenced:
19 (a) If a probate proceeding is pending in which notice to creditors
20 has been given at the time of filing a proceeding under this section:
21 (1) As to a creditor whose claim was properly and timely filed,
22 allowed by the personal representative or partially allowed by the
23 personal representative, and accepted by the creditor pursuant to NRS
24 147.160, within 60 days after the probate court enters an order
25 confirming the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final
26 and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year
27 after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
28 (2) As to a creditor:
29 (I) Whose claim was rejected by the personal
30 representative, partially allowed by the personal representative and
31 rejected by the creditor pursuant to NRS 147.160, or deemed rejected
32 by the personal representative pursuant to NRS 147.110;
33 (II) Who adjudicated the creditor’s claims in the proper
34 court or by a summary adjudication; and
35 (III) Who obtained a favorable final judgment on its claim
36 from the proper court,
37  within 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming
38 the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final and no
39 longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the
40 decedent’s death, whichever is later.
41 (b) If an action had been commenced against the decedent before
42 the decedent’s death, the creditor receives a judgment against the
43 decedent’s estate and the creditor has filed a proper and timely
44 creditor’s claim against the estate, within 60 days after the probate
45 court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of the
-
*SB494_R1*
– 46 –
1 adjudicated claim that is final and no longer subject to reconsideration
2 or appeal or within 1 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is
3 later.
4 (c) As to the recovery of benefits paid for Medicaid, within 3
5 years after the decedent’s death.
6 (d) As to all other creditors, within 1 year after the decedent’s
7 death.
8 11. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent’s probate
9 estate is nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and
10 statutory allowances has been received from the decedent’s personal
11 representative, the following rules apply:
12 (a) Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution,
13 registrar or other obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance
14 with the terms of the governing instrument controlling the transfer
15 releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets
16 delivered.
17 (b) A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is
18 released from liability under this section with respect to any assets
19 distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent
20 of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the
21 trustee’s liability attributable to assets received by the beneficiary.
22 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 13,
23 notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
24 (a) A creditor has no claim against:
25 (1) Property transferred pursuant to a power of appointment
26 exercised by a decedent unless the power of appointment was actually
27 exercised in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate.

30 (I) An individual retirement arrangement which conforms
31 with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable limitations and
32 requirements of section 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code,
33 26 U.S.C. §§ 408 and 408A, including, without limitation, an
34 inherited individual retirement arrangement;
35 (II) A written simplified employee pension plan which

43 arrangement plan;
44 (IV) A trust forming part of a stock bonus, pension or
45 profit-sharing plan which is qualified and maintained pursuant to
-
*SB494_R1*

3 (V) A trust forming part of a qualified tuition program
4 pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS, any applicable regulations adopted

7 the entry of a judgment against the purchaser or account owner or the
8 money will not be used by any beneficiary to attend a college or

10 (3) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
11 by a decedent which transfers money, benefits or privileges that

15 (g) of subsection 1 of NRS 21.090.
16 (5) A trust, a beneficial interest of the decedent under a trust
17 or amount payable from a trust if the trust was created by someone
18 other than the decedent, except to enforce a valid assignment of the
19 decedent’s beneficial interest under a trust that is not a spendthrift
20 trust.
21 (6) An irrevocable trust or amounts payable from a trust if the
22 trust was properly created as a valid spendthrift trust under chapter
23 166 of NRS, except with respect to property transferred to the trust
24 by the decedent to the extent permitted under subsections 1, 2 and 3
25 of NRS 166.170.
26 (b) A purchaser for value of property or a lender who acquires a
27 security interest in the property from a beneficiary of a nonprobate
28 transfer after the death of the owner, in good faith:
29 (1) Takes the property free of any claims or of liability to the
30 owner’s estate, creditors of the owner’s estate, persons claiming

39 relieve a purchaser or lender from the notice imparted by instruments
40 of record respecting the property.

4 115.090 Nothing in this chapter exempts any real or personal

9 property of a recipient of Medicaid in the manner set forth in NRS
10 422.29302, 422.29304 and 422.29306.
11 Sec. 46. NRS 123.259 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
13 court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by a
14 spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the income
15 and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if one
16 spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
17 community spouse.
18 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
19 contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
20 enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
21 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
22 divide the income and resources:
23 (a) Equally between the spouses; or
24 (b) By protecting income for the community spouse through
25 application of the maximum federal minimum monthly maintenance

31 income greater than that otherwise provided under paragraph (b) of
32 subsection 3, upon finding exceptional circumstances resulting in

34 that finding, the court may enter an order for support against the
35 institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse in
36 an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is
37 necessary.
38 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
39 community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
40 relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
41 inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
42 amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
43 support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
44 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount
45 so allowed or to fund the order for support.

14 equal shares of separate income, assets and obligations of the spouses.
15 Such an agreement is effective only if one spouse is an
16 institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a community spouse

45 established by the decedent and in existence at the decedent’s death,
-
*SB494_R1*
– 52 –
1 the portion of the estate subject to such direction may be set aside
2 without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s estate set aside
3 to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
4 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the court
5 that the trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to such
6 creditors on behalf of the nontestamentary trust and settlor pursuant
7 to NRS 164.025.

23 decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more minor children, the
24 court must set aside the estate for the benefit of the surviving spouse
25 or the minor child or minor children of the decedent, subject to any

34 a manifest injustice.
35 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are nonprobate
36 transfers that already benefit the surviving spouse or minor child or
37 minor children of the decedent, the court has the discretion to reduce
38 the amount set aside under subsection 3 to the extent that the value of
39 the estate, when combined with the value of nonprobate transfers, as
40 defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent to or for the benefit of the
41 surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the decedent
42 exceeds $100,000.

6 considered a transfer for the benefit of such spouse or minor child or
7 minor children.

35 is less than $100,000.

40 shall give notice of the petition and hearing in the manner provided
41 in NRS 155.010 to the decedent’s heirs and devisees and to the
42 Director of the [Department of Health and Human Services.] Nevada
43 Health Authority. If a complete copy of the petition is not enclosed
44 with the notice, the notice must include a statement setting forth to
45 whom the estate is being set aside.

21 money may be used for the benefit of the minor child as is deemed in
22 the court’s discretion to be in the best interests of the minor child, and

4 Child and Family Services and the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy.

9 regulation of certain persons and entities involved in the provision of health care and
10 the regulation of sanitation in food establishments and certain other locations.
11 Section 18 of this bill creates and establishes the purposes of the Authority, and

26 the mailing, for those required to be mailed, or 90 days after
27 publication of the first notice to creditors pursuant to subsection 3.
28 Any claim against a grantor or the probate estate of a grantor, as
29 applicable, not filed within that time is forever barred. After the
30 expiration of the time to file a claim as provided in this section, the
31 beneficiary or beneficiaries may sell or distribute the property
32 transferred pursuant to the deed upon death, without personal liability
33 for any claim which has not been timely filed with the beneficiary or
34 beneficiaries if, in accordance with subsection 6, the beneficiary or
35 beneficiaries have received a waiver of claim after providing written
36 notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services] Nevada
37 Health Authority as required by subsection 3.
38 6. If notice to the [Department of Health and Human Services]
39 Nevada Health Authority is not given, the property transferred by the
40 deed upon death remains subject to the right of the [Department]
41 Authority to recover public assistance received by the grantor. The
42 [Department] Authority may initiate an action to impose a lien on the
43 real property transferred by the deed upon death pursuant to NRS
44 422.29306, take any other action allowable by law to secure the future
45 recovery of benefits or make a written demand for payment, as
-
*SB494_R1*

– 43 –
1 applicable. The [Department] Authority shall notify the beneficiary
2 or beneficiaries in writing within 45 days after receipt of a notice
3 pursuant to subsection 3 whether the grantor was a recipient of public
4 assistance and, if he or she was not a recipient of assistance, provide
5 an original waiver of claim to the beneficiaries for the purposes of
6 recording the deed upon death.
7 7. For claims not originating with the [Department of Health and
8 Human Services,] Nevada Health Authority, if a claim is rejected by
9 the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon death, in whole
10 or in part, the beneficiary or beneficiaries must, within 10 days after
11 the rejection, notify the claimant of the rejection by written notice
12 sent by registered or certified mail to the mailing address of the
13 claimant. The claimant must bring suit in the proper court against the
14 beneficiary or beneficiaries within 30 days after the notice is sent,
15 whether the claim is due or not, or the claim is barred forever and the
16 beneficiary or beneficiaries under the deed upon death may distribute
17 the property transferred by the deed upon death without personal
18 liability to any creditor whose claim is barred forever.
19 8. A title company that is engaged regarding the transfer of the
20 property identified in a deed upon death may recognize that the
21 notices provided pursuant to this section constitute adequate notice
22 required by law. A title company is not liable for claims of which the
23 title company is not made aware by the beneficiaries.
24 9. A person dealing with a beneficiary of a deed upon death has
25 the same rights and protections as the person would have if the
26 beneficiary had been named as a distributee of the property in an order
27 for distribution of the grantor’s estate that had become final if both of
28 the following conditions are satisfied:
29 (a) The person acted in good faith and for valuable consideration;
30 and
31 (b) A Death of Grantor Affidavit was recorded pursuant to
32 NRS 111.699.
33 Sec. 44. NRS 111.779 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 111.779 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 21.090 and
35 other applicable law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is liable to
36 the probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that
37 decedent’s probate estate to the extent the estate is insufficient to
38 satisfy those claims.
39 2. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the
40 value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that
41 transferee.
42 3. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency
43 described in subsection 1 in the following order of priority:
-
*SB494_R1*

– 44 –
1 (a) A transferee specified in the decedent’s will or any other
2 governing instrument as being liable for such an insufficiency, in the
3 order of priority provided in the will or other governing instrument;
4 (b) The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate
5 instrument in the decedent’s estate plan as shown by its designation
6 as devisee of the decedent’s residuary estate or by other facts or
7 circumstances, to the extent of the value of the nonprobate transfer
8 received or controlled; and
9 (c) Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values
10 received.
11 4. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests of
12 beneficiaries in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section abate
13 as necessary to satisfy the liability, as if all the trust instruments were
14 a single will and the interests were devises under it.
15 5. If a nonprobate transferee is a spouse or a minor child, the
16 nonprobate transferee may petition the court to be excluded from the
17 liability imposed by this section as if the nonprobate property
18 received by the spouse or minor child were part of the decedent’s
19 estate. Such a petition may be made pursuant to the applicable
20 provisions of chapter 146 of NRS, including, without limitation, the
21 provisions of NRS 146.010 and 146.020 and subsection 2 of
22 NRS 146.070.
23 6. A provision made in one instrument may direct the
24 apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees
25 taking under that or any other governing instrument. If a provision in
26 one instrument conflicts with a provision in another, the later one
27 prevails.
28 7. Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability
29 imposed by this section is enforceable in probate proceedings in this
30 State, whether or not the transferee is located in this State.
31 8. If a probate proceeding is pending at the time of filing and it
32 has been determined by a final order issued by the probate court that
33 there are insufficient assets to pay a valid creditor, a proceeding under
34 this section may be commenced by one of the following persons:
35 (a) The personal representative of the decedent’s estate. A
36 personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a
37 proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.
38 (b) A creditor of the estate, if the personal representative has
39 declined or refused to commence an action within 30 days after
40 receiving a written demand by a creditor. Such demand must identify
41 the nonprobate transfers known to the creditor. If the creditor is
42 unaware of any nonprobate transfers, in the probate proceeding, the
43 creditor may, pursuant to NRS 155.170, obtain discovery, perpetuate
44 testimony or conduct examinations in any manner authorized by law
45 or by the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure to ascertain whether any
-
*SB494_R1*

– 45 –
1 nonprobate transfers exist. If the creditor is unable to identify any
2 nonprobate transfers within a reasonable time after conducting
3 discovery, the creditor may not proceed under this section. If a
4 creditor commences an action under this section:
5 (1) The creditor must proceed at the expense of the creditor
6 and not of the estate.
7 (2) If a creditor successfully establishes an entitlement to
8 payment under this section and collects nonprobate transfers, the
9 court must order the reimbursement of the costs reasonably incurred
10 by the creditor, including attorney’s fees, from the transferee from
11 whom the payment is to be made, subject to the limitations of
12 subsection 2, or from the estate as a cost of administration, or partially
13 from each, as the court deems just.
14 9. If a probate proceeding is not pending, a proceeding under
15 this section may be commenced as a civil action by a creditor at the
16 expense of the creditor.
17 10. If a proceeding is commenced pursuant to this section, it
18 must be commenced:
19 (a) If a probate proceeding is pending in which notice to creditors
20 has been given at the time of filing a proceeding under this section:
21 (1) As to a creditor whose claim was properly and timely filed,
22 allowed by the personal representative or partially allowed by the
23 personal representative, and accepted by the creditor pursuant to NRS
24 147.160, within 60 days after the probate court enters an order
25 confirming the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final
26 and no longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year
27 after the decedent’s death, whichever is later.
28 (2) As to a creditor:
29 (I) Whose claim was rejected by the personal
30 representative, partially allowed by the personal representative and
31 rejected by the creditor pursuant to NRS 147.160, or deemed rejected
32 by the personal representative pursuant to NRS 147.110;
33 (II) Who adjudicated the creditor’s claims in the proper
34 court or by a summary adjudication; and
35 (III) Who obtained a favorable final judgment on its claim
36 from the proper court,
37  within 60 days after the probate court enters an order confirming
38 the amount of payment of the approved claim that is final and no
39 longer subject to reconsideration or appeal or within 1 year after the
40 decedent’s death, whichever is later.
41 (b) If an action had been commenced against the decedent before
42 the decedent’s death, the creditor receives a judgment against the
43 decedent’s estate and the creditor has filed a proper and timely
44 creditor’s claim against the estate, within 60 days after the probate
45 court enters an order confirming the amount of payment of the
-
*SB494_R1*

– 46 –
1 adjudicated claim that is final and no longer subject to reconsideration
2 or appeal or within 1 year after the decedent’s death, whichever is
3 later.
4 (c) As to the recovery of benefits paid for Medicaid, within 3
5 years after the decedent’s death.
6 (d) As to all other creditors, within 1 year after the decedent’s
7 death.
8 11. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent’s probate
9 estate is nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and
10 statutory allowances has been received from the decedent’s personal
11 representative, the following rules apply:
12 (a) Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution,
13 registrar or other obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance
14 with the terms of the governing instrument controlling the transfer
15 releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets
16 delivered.
17 (b) A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is
18 released from liability under this section with respect to any assets
19 distributed to the trust’s beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent
20 of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the
21 trustee’s liability attributable to assets received by the beneficiary.
22 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 13,
23 notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary:
24 (a) A creditor has no claim against:
25 (1) Property transferred pursuant to a power of appointment
26 exercised by a decedent unless the power of appointment was actually
27 exercised in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate.
28 (2) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
29 by a decedent which transfers money held by any of the following:
30 (I) An individual retirement arrangement which conforms
31 with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable limitations and
32 requirements of section 408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code,
33 26 U.S.C. §§ 408 and 408A, including, without limitation, an
34 inherited individual retirement arrangement;
35 (II) A written simplified employee pension plan which
36 conforms with or is maintained pursuant to the applicable limitations

43 arrangement plan;
44 (IV) A trust forming part of a stock bonus, pension or
45 profit-sharing plan which is qualified and maintained pursuant to
-
*SB494_R1*

– 47 –
1 sections 401 et seq. of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §§ 401
2 et seq.; and
3 (V) A trust forming part of a qualified tuition program
4 pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS, any applicable regulations adopted
5 pursuant to chapter 353B of NRS and section 529 of the Internal

7 the entry of a judgment against the purchaser or account owner or the
8 money will not be used by any beneficiary to attend a college or
9 university.
10 (3) Property transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation
11 by a decedent which transfers money, benefits or privileges that

15 (g) of subsection 1 of NRS 21.090.
16 (5) A trust, a beneficial interest of the decedent under a trust
17 or amount payable from a trust if the trust was created by someone
18 other than the decedent, except to enforce a valid assignment of the
19 decedent’s beneficial interest under a trust that is not a spendthrift
20 trust.
21 (6) An irrevocable trust or amounts payable from a trust if the
22 trust was properly created as a valid spendthrift trust under chapter
23 166 of NRS, except with respect to property transferred to the trust
24 by the decedent to the extent permitted under subsections 1, 2 and 3
25 of NRS 166.170.
26 (b) A purchaser for value of property or a lender who acquires a
27 security interest in the property from a beneficiary of a nonprobate
28 transfer after the death of the owner, in good faith:
29 (1) Takes the property free of any claims or of liability to the
30 owner’s estate, creditors of the owner’s estate, persons claiming

39 relieve a purchaser or lender from the notice imparted by instruments
40 of record respecting the property.

9 property of a recipient of Medicaid in the manner set forth in NRS
10 422.29302, 422.29304 and 422.29306.
11 Sec. 46. NRS 123.259 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
13 court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by a
14 spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the income
15 and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if one
16 spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
17 community spouse.
18 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
19 contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
20 enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
21 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
22 divide the income and resources:
23 (a) Equally between the spouses; or

37 necessary.
38 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
39 community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
40 relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
41 inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
42 amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
43 support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
44 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount
45 so allowed or to fund the order for support.
