EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil liability; providing immunity from civil
liability for certain acts and omissions of volunteer
security personnel of a religious organization under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a volunteer of a charitable organization is immune
2 from liability for civil damages as a result of an act or omission concerning services
3 the volunteer performs for the charitable organization that are not supervisory in
4 nature and are not part of any duties or responsibilities the volunteer may have as
5 an officer, director or trustee of the charitable organization, unless the act is
6 intentional, willful, wanton or malicious. However, this provision of existing law
7 does not restrict the liability of a charitable organization for the acts or omissions of
8 a volunteer performing services on its behalf. (NRS 41.485) Existing law also
9 provides that, with certain exceptions, nonprofit corporations, associations and
10 organizations formed under the laws of this State are not immune from civil
11 liability for injury or damage arising out of negligent or wrongful acts under certain
12 circumstances. (NRS 41.480)
13 Section 1 of this bill provides that in addition to any other immunity from civil
14 liability provided by existing law, volunteer security personnel of a religious
15 organization who are providing safety, security or protection services for a religious
16 organization are immune from civil liability for injury or damage caused by their

17 acts or omissions if: (1) such volunteer security personnel are acting within the
18 scope of their duties or responsibilities as volunteer security personnel; and (2) such
19 acts or omissions are not reckless, wanton or grossly negligent. Section 1 also
20 provides that in addition to any other immunity from civil liability provided by
21 existing law, a religious organization is immune from civil liability for the acts or
22 omissions of its volunteer security personnel who are providing safety, security or
23 protection services on its behalf.
24 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the changes made
25 by section 1. Section 3 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of this
26 bill apply to a civil action that is filed on or after October 1, 2025.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

8 (a) Such volunteer security personnel are acting within the
9 scope of their duties and responsibilities as volunteer security
10 personnel; and
11 (b) Such acts or omissions are not reckless, wanton or grossly
12 negligent.
13 2. In addition to any other immunity from civil liability
14 provided by law, a religious organization is immune from civil
15 liability for the acts or omissions of its volunteer security
16 personnel who are providing safety, security or protection services
17 on its behalf pursuant to subsection 1.
18 3. As used in this section:

2 41.480 1. Except as otherwise provided [in NRS 41.519,] by

4 formed under the laws of this State is not immune from liability for
