EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring certain public schools to employ a school
social worker to the extent that money is available for that purpose;
creating immunity from civil liability for a school district or
charter school for certain actions that constitute harassment or
power-based violence if the school district or charter school
establishes, enforces and publishes a policy containing certain
provisions relating to harassment and power-based violence;
requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
adopt regulations relating to the licensure of school psychologists,
school counselors and school social workers; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements governing educational personnel, including
2 requirements governing the licensing, qualifications, employment, powers, duties, supervision
3 and evaluation of such personnel. (Chapter 391 of NRS) Under existing law, the Commission
4 on Professional Standards in Education is required to adopt regulations relating to the
5 qualifications for licensure of teachers and other educational personnel, including: (1)
6 regulations relating to the qualifications for licensure of school counselors and school social
7 workers; and (2) regulations that allow a person who is currently employed by a public school
8 in a position to provide support or other services relating to school psychology to
9 simultaneously complete a program of internship in psychology. (NRS 391.019, 391.0349)
10 Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations that allow a person who is
11 employed by a public school in a position relating to school counseling or school social work,
12 as applicable, and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or
13 endorsement as a school counselor or school social worker, as applicable, to simultaneously
14 complete any required internship or practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such a
15 license or endorsement. Section 2 further requires the Commission to adopt regulations that
16 allow a person who is employed by a public school in a position relating to school psychology
Senate Amendment No. 782 to Senate Bill No. 277 First Reprint Page 4
17 and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or endorsement as
18 a school psychologist to simultaneously complete any required practicum hours.
19 Existing law establishes the powers and duties of a school counselor and school social
20 worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.296) Existing law requires each public school, including each
21 charter school, to the extent that money is available for that purpose, to employ a school
22 counselor at the school on a full-time basis. (NRS 388.055) Section [1] 1.3 of this bill
23 additionally requires each public school in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
24 (currently only Clark County), to the extent that money is available for that purpose, to
25 employ a school social worker at the school on a full-time basis. Section [1] 1.3 also
26 prohibits, insofar as is practicable, each public school from entering into a contract with an
27 independent contractor for the provision of the services that a school social worker is
28 authorized to perform.
29 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this State and
30 provides that each school district may be sued. (NRS 386.010) Section 1.7 of this bill: (1)
31 makes a school district or charter school immune from civil liability for an incident of
32 harassment or power-based violence by pupils or staff if it demonstrates that it
33 established, enforced and adequately published a comprehensive policy to prevent
34 harassment and power-based violence; and (2) requires such a policy to include certain
35 provisions.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring certain public schools to employ a school
social worker to the extent that money is available for that purpose;
creating immunity from civil liability for a school district or
charter school for certain actions that constitute harassment or
power-based violence if the school district or charter school
establishes, enforces and publishes a policy containing certain
provisions relating to harassment and power-based violence;
requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
adopt regulations relating to the licensure of school psychologists,
school counselors and school social workers; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements governing educational personnel, including
2 requirements governing the licensing, qualifications, employment, powers, duties, supervision
3 and evaluation of such personnel. (Chapter 391 of NRS) Under existing law, the Commission
4 on Professional Standards in Education is required to adopt regulations relating to the
5 qualifications for licensure of teachers and other educational personnel, including: (1)
6 regulations relating to the qualifications for licensure of school counselors and school social
7 workers; and (2) regulations that allow a person who is currently employed by a public school
8 in a position to provide support or other services relating to school psychology to
9 simultaneously complete a program of internship in psychology. (NRS 391.019, 391.0349)
10 Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations that allow a person who is
11 employed by a public school in a position relating to school counseling or school social work,
12 as applicable, and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or
13 endorsement as a school counselor or school social worker, as applicable, to simultaneously
14 complete any required internship or practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such a
15 license or endorsement. Section 2 further requires the Commission to adopt regulations that
16 allow a person who is employed by a public school in a position relating to school psychology

Senate Amendment No. 782 to Senate Bill No. 277 First Reprint Page 4
17 and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or endorsement as
18 a school psychologist to simultaneously complete any required practicum hours.
19 Existing law establishes the powers and duties of a school counselor and school social
20 worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.296) Existing law requires each public school, including each
21 charter school, to the extent that money is available for that purpose, to employ a school
22 counselor at the school on a full-time basis. (NRS 388.055) Section [1] 1.3 of this bill
23 additionally requires each public school in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
24 (currently only Clark County), to the extent that money is available for that purpose, to
25 employ a school social worker at the school on a full-time basis. Section [1] 1.3 also
26 prohibits, insofar as is practicable, each public school from entering into a contract with an
27 independent contractor for the provision of the services that a school social worker is
28 authorized to perform.
29 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this State and
30 provides that each school district may be sued. (NRS 386.010) Section 1.7 of this bill: (1)
31 makes a school district or charter school immune from civil liability for an incident of
32 harassment or power-based violence by pupils or staff if it demonstrates that it
33 established, enforced and adequately published a comprehensive policy to prevent
34 harassment and power-based violence; and (2) requires such a policy to include certain
35 provisions.
