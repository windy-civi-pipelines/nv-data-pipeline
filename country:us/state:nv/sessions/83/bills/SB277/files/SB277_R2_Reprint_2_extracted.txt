EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring certain public schools to
employ a school social worker to the extent that money is
available for that purpose; creating immunity from civil
liability for a school district or charter school for certain
actions that constitute harassment or power-based
violence if the school district or charter school
establishes, enforces and publishes a policy containing
certain provisions relating to harassment and power-based
violence; requiring the Commission on Professional
Standards in Education to adopt regulations relating to the
licensure of school psychologists, school counselors and
school social workers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements governing educational personnel,
2 including requirements governing the licensing, qualifications, employment,
3 powers, duties, supervision and evaluation of such personnel. (Chapter 391 of
4 NRS) Under existing law, the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
5 is required to adopt regulations relating to the qualifications for licensure of
6 teachers and other educational personnel, including: (1) regulations relating to the
7 qualifications for licensure of school counselors and school social workers; and (2)
8 regulations that allow a person who is currently employed by a public school in a
-
*SB277_R2*
– 2 –
9 position to provide support or other services relating to school psychology to
10 simultaneously complete a program of internship in psychology. (NRS 391.019,
11 391.0349) Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations that
12 allow a person who is employed by a public school in a position relating to school
13 counseling or school social work, as applicable, and is enrolled in a program that
14 would allow the person to obtain a license or endorsement as a school counselor or
15 school social worker, as applicable, to simultaneously complete any required
16 internship or practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such a license or
17 endorsement. Section 2 further requires the Commission to adopt regulations that
18 allow a person who is employed by a public school in a position relating to school
19 psychology and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a
20 license or endorsement as a school psychologist to simultaneously complete any
21 required practicum hours.
22 Existing law establishes the powers and duties of a school counselor and school
23 social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.296) Existing law requires each public school,
24 including each charter school, to the extent that money is available for that purpose,
25 to employ a school counselor at the school on a full-time basis. (NRS 388.055)
26 Section 1.3 of this bill additionally requires each public school in a county whose
27 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), to the extent that
28 money is available for that purpose, to employ a school social worker at the school
29 on a full-time basis. Section 1.3 also prohibits, insofar as is practicable, each public
30 school from entering into a contract with an independent contractor for the
31 provision of the services that a school social worker is authorized to perform.
32 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this
33 State and provides that each school district may be sued. (NRS 386.010) Section
34 1.7 of this bill: (1) makes a school district or charter school immune from civil
35 liability for an incident of harassment or power-based violence by pupils or staff if
36 it demonstrates that it established, enforced and adequately published a
37 comprehensive policy to prevent harassment and power-based violence; and (2)
38 requires such a policy to include certain provisions.
