AN ACT relating to education; requiring [each] certain public [school] schools to
employ a school social worker to the extent that money is available for
that purpose; requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in
Education to adopt regulations relating to the licensure of school
psychologists, school counselors and school social workers; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements governing educational personnel, including
2 requirements governing the licensing, qualifications, employment, powers, duties, supervision
3 and evaluation of such personnel. (Chapter 391 of NRS) Under existing law, the Commission
4 on Professional Standards in Education is required to adopt regulations relating to the
5 qualifications for licensure of teachers and other educational personnel, including: (1)
6 regulations relating to the qualifications for licensure of school counselors and school social
7 workers; and (2) regulations that allow a person who is currently employed by a public school
8 in a position to provide support or other services relating to school psychology to
9 simultaneously complete a program of internship in psychology. (NRS 391.019, 391.0349)
10 Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations that allow a person who is
11 employed by a public school in a position relating to school counseling or school social work,
12 as applicable, and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or
13 endorsement as a school counselor or school social worker, as applicable, to simultaneously
14 complete any required internship or practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such a
15 license or endorsement. Section 2 further requires the Commission to adopt regulations
16 that allow a person who is employed by a public school in a position relating to school
17 psychology and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license
18 or endorsement as a school psychologist to simultaneously complete any required
19 practicum hours.
20 Existing law establishes the powers and duties of a school counselor and school social
21 worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.296) Existing law requires each public school, including each
22 charter school, to the extent that money is available for that purpose, to employ a school
23 counselor at the school on a full-time basis. (NRS 388.055) Section 1 of this bill additionally
24 requires each public school [,] in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently

Senate Amendment No. 272 to Senate Bill No. 277 Page 4
25 only Clark County), to the extent that money is available for that purpose, to employ a
26 school social worker at the school on a full-time basis. Section 1 also prohibits, insofar as is
27 practicable, each public school from entering into a contract with an independent contractor
28 for the provision of the services that a school social worker is authorized to perform.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 388 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:

6 school social worker at the school on a full-time basis.

38 employment from a school district, charter school or private school; and
39 (VII) Upon the completion by a person of the education and training
40 required under the alternative route to licensure and the satisfaction of all other
41 requirements for licensure, provide for the issuance of a regular license to the
