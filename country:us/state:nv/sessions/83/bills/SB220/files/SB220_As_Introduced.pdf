– 2 –
3 picture or other qualified production, based upon qualified direct production
4 expenditures made for the purchase, rental or lease of personal property or services
5 from a Nevada business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) This bill revises provisions
6 governing these transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada Film Infrastructure,
7 Workforce Development, Education and Economic Diversification Act to authorize
8 film infrastructure transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced at the
9 Nevada Studios Project at the Harry Reid Research and Technology Park, which is
10 owned by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Research Foundation.
11 Sections 1-18 of this bill enact the Nevada Film Infrastructure, Workforce
12 Development, Education and Economic Diversification Act, which provides for
13 film infrastructure transferable tax credits to be issued to production companies that
14 produce qualified productions, in whole or in part, at the Nevada Studios Project, as
15 defined in section 8. Section 10 requires the Office of Economic Development to
16 enter into a development agreement with the lead participant for the Project and to
17 establish certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy in exchange for
18 production companies located at the Project to be eligible for film infrastructure
19 transferable tax credits. Section 12: (1) authorizes a production company located at
20 the Project that has obtained the written approval of the lead participant under
21 section 11 to apply for film infrastructure transferable tax credits for qualified
22 productions produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and (2) authorizes such
23 credits to be used against the modified business tax, insurance premium tax or
24 gaming license fee, or any combination of these taxes and fees. Section 13
25 establishes the qualified direct production expenditures which are the basis for
26 calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits, including,
27 without limitation, purchases, leases and rentals of property or services from a
28 Nevada business, wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are Nevada
29 residents for services on the qualified production, certain fees paid to producers and
30 amounts paid to certain corporations or companies for the services of certain
31 persons on the qualified production. Section 14 provides that the base amount of
32 film infrastructure transferable tax credits is the sum of: (1) 35 percent of the
33 qualified direct production expenditures paid to Nevada residents for services in
34 connection with the qualified production; and (2) 30 percent of the amount of all
35 other qualified direct production expenditures. Under section 14: (1) the amount of
36 film infrastructure transferable tax credits for which a production company is
37 eligible is reduced by specified percentages if, after certain periods, the number of
38 Nevada residents who are below-the-line personnel of the qualified production is
39 less than certain percentages; (2) film infrastructure transferable tax credits may be
40 reduced by the amount of any damages incurred by the State or a political
41 subdivision of this State as a result of a qualified production; and (3) film
42 infrastructure transferable tax credits may be withheld for certain violations of law.
43 Section 15: (1) establishes the maximum amount of film infrastructure transferable
44 tax credits that may be issued pursuant to sections 1-18 during each 12-month
45 period of the development period and for each fiscal year thereafter; (2) authorizes
46 50 percent of the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits that are
47 authorized for the development period or for a fiscal year following the
48 development period, but are not approved, to be carried forward and made available
49 for approval in subsequent fiscal years; and (3) prohibits the issuance of film
50 infrastructure transferable tax credits for a fiscal year that begins more than 15
51 years after the Project receives its first certificate of occupancy. Section 16
52 establishes the time within which a production company that produces a qualified
53 production is required to submit to the Office and the Department of Taxation any
54 audits or other information required to determine the eligibility of the production
55 company for film infrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 17 requires a
56 production company to repay film infrastructure transferable tax credits under

57 certain circumstances. Section 18 requires certain reports to be made to the
58 Governor and the Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
59 Sections 19-24 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing
60 the noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified
61 productions. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 19: (1) provides that digital media
62 productions are qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film
63 infrastructure transferable tax credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits;
64 and (2) clarifies that media productions solely produced for social media are not
65 eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 20 revises certain criteria for a
66 qualified production to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits.
67 Section 21 increases the base amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits
68 for an application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025,
69 and ending before July 1, 2043, from 15 percent of the qualified direct production
70 expenditures to the sum of: (1) 35 percent of the qualified direct production
71 expenditures paid to Nevada residents for services in connection with the qualified
72 production; and (2) 30 percent of the amount of all other qualified direct production
73 expenditures. Section 21 also requires reductions to that base amount under certain
74 circumstances. Section 22 temporarily increases from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000
75 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and
76 other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing program for each
77 fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until June 30, 2043. Section 23
78 makes conforming changes to update a reference that was renumbered in section 20
79 and to consistently refer to the existing program of transferable tax credits as
80 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 24 makes conforming changes so
81 that the information required to be reported by the Office concerning
82 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits is similar to the information required to be
83 reported by the Office concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
84 Sections 25-32 of this bill establish a program to pay certain costs related to the
85 Nevada Media and Technology Lab and to provide grants to certain organizations
86 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the
87 production of motion picture and other qualified productions. Section 30 creates
88 the Account for Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and
89 Vocational Training for the purpose of paying certain costs related to the Nevada
90 Media and Technology Lab and to make grants to certain entities and organizations
91 that provide education and vocational training for such workforce development.
92 Sections 12 and 20 require a production company that is issued transferable tax
93 credits for a qualified production to pay to the Office an amount of money equal to
94 10 percent of the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the qualified
95 production, and require the Office to deposit that money with the State Treasurer
96 for credit to the Account. Section 31 creates and provides for the composition of
97 the Board for Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and
98 Vocational Training within the Office of Economic Development. Section 32
99 requires the Board to: (1) establish the procedures for a person or entity to apply for
100 a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to be used to determine whether to
101 approve an application for a grant from the Account to an applicant and the
102 requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of the
103 grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board
104 approves the application for the grant; and (3) requires a recipient of a grant from
105 the Account to adopt and implement a community benefits program that satisfies
106 certain requirements.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. This act may be cited as the Nevada Film
2 Infrastructure, Workforce Development, Education and Economic
3 Diversification Act.
4 Sec. 2. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
5 (a) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan
6 area in this State and has a need to improve the education and
7 training of the workforce in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area and to
8 diversify the economy of the Area, as indicated by the impact of the
9 COVID-19 pandemic on the Area. The Harry Reid Research and
10 Technology Park has been identified as a location in the Las Vegas
11 Metropolitan Area for a project that can address the needs of the Las
12 Vegas Metropolitan Area for workforce education and training and
13 economic diversification.
14 (b) Land at the Harry Reid Research and Technology Park will
15 be allocated for an educational and vocational training center, to be
16 known as the Nevada Media and Technology Lab, which will
17 provide workforce development, education and economic
18 diversification by providing career pathways in film, video game
19 publishing, defense, health care and other industries identified by
20 the UNLV Research Foundation through the Creative Technology
21 Initiative at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and the Video
22 Game Publishing Design Program Initiative at the University of
23 Nevada, Las Vegas.
24 (c) Land at the Harry Reid Research and Technology Park will
25 also be allocated for large-scale facilities for the location of
26 companies that produce motion pictures and other qualified
27 productions in this State, which will create high-paying jobs in that
28 industry and diversify the economy of the Las Vegas Metropolitan
29 Area and this State as a whole.
30 (d) Because the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area and the Harry
31 Reid Research and Technology Park is the only area in this State
32 that is appropriate and suitable for the Nevada Media and
33 Technology Lab and the development of large-scale projects to
34 develop large-scale facilities for the location of companies that
35 produce motion pictures and other qualified productions and has all
36 the special attributes, conditions and resources that are essential to
37 support such facilities, it is necessary to enact a law of local and
38 special application to promote, develop and secure the advantages of
39 the local and special characteristics and circumstances within the
40 Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, which are found nowhere else in this
41 State, and to benefit the residents of the Las Vegas Metropolitan
42 Area.

1 (e) Therefore, given that a law of local and special application is
2 necessary to promote, develop and secure the advantages of the
3 local and special characteristics and circumstances within the Las
4 Vegas Metropolitan Area, which are found nowhere else within this
5 State, and given that such a law is necessary to benefit the residents
6 of that local and special area, a general law cannot be made
7 applicable to the purposes, objects, powers, rights, privileges,
8 immunities, liabilities, duties and disabilities set forth in the Nevada
9 Film Infrastructure, Workforce Development, Education and
10 Economic Diversification Act.
11 2. The Legislature further finds and declares that as a result of
12 the construction of large-scale facilities for the production of motion
13 pictures and other qualified productions in this State and the direct,
14 indirect and induced economic benefits of such productions in this
15 State, the enactment of the Act will achieve a bona fide social or
16 economic purpose and the economic benefits of the issuance of the
17 transferable tax credits to encourage the location of large-scale
18 facilities for the production of motion pictures and other qualified
19 productions in this State are expected to exceed any adverse effect
20 of the transferable tax credits on the revenue raised for the provision
21 of services to the public by the State or a local government.
22 Sec. 3. As used in sections 1 to 18, inclusive, of this act,
23 unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined
24 NRS 360.7581 to 360.7586, inclusive, as amended by section 19 of
25 this act, have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections, and
26 the words and terms defined in sections 4 to 9, inclusive, of this act
27 have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.

29 incurred by the lead participant in the Nevada Studios Project only

31 limitation, the right to the possession of land through a ground lease,

33 the infrastructure, at the Project for the development of the Nevada
34 Media and Technology Lab and large-scale facilities for the location
35 of companies that produce qualified productions at the Project. The
36 amount of capital investment made in connection with the
37 acquisition of a right to possess land through a ground lease must be
38 the cost equivalent of the land.
39 Sec. 5. “Lead participant” means the person or entity
40 designated by the owner of the Nevada Studios Project as the lead
