5 Department of Health and Human Services to create a non-opioid directive, which
6 is a form on which a person may indicate that he or she does not wish to receive
-

7 opioids, and to post the non-opioid directive on an Internet website maintained by
8 the Division. Section 16 of this bill requires: (1) certain practitioners to provide a
9 person with an opportunity to execute a non-opioid directive; (2) third party
10 insurers that provide health coverage to provide persons who enroll in such health
11 coverage a non-opioid directive; and (3) certain health care facilities to ensure that
12 persons providing care at the facility provide a patient with an opportunity to
13 execute a non-opioid directive. Section 16 also requires such third party insurers
14 and health facilities to post the non-opioid directive on their Internet websites.
15 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill set forth the procedure for a patient to execute and
16 revoke a non-opioid directive.
17 Section 19 of this bill prohibits a person who knows or should know that a
18 person has executed a non-opioid directive from prescribing, administering or
19 directing or supervising the administration of an opioid to that person except under
20 certain circumstances. Section 21 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to
21 adopt regulations prescribing procedures relating to the non-opioid directive.
22 Sections 22 and 23 of this bill require the Administrator of the Division to

28 Sections 1 and 33-40 of this bill require a medical facility, certain other health
29 care facilities and certain practitioners who prescribe or administer opioids to
30 comply with the provisions of law governing non-opioid directives. Under section
31 55 of this bill, beginning on July 1, 2027, or 6 months after the date on which the
32 regulations relating to the non-opioid directives become effective, whichever is
33 later, sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require such facilities and practitioners to
34 offer and provide alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids to patients who
35 have requested such alternatives or executed non-opioid directives, except in
36 certain circumstances. Sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require the regulatory
37 bodies that license such facilities and practitioners to biennially review the
38 compliance of such facilities and practitioners with those requirements. Sections 34
39 and 38 make conforming changes to clarify that sections 33 and 37, respectively,
40 apply to the prescribing and administering of opioids to treat intractable pain.
41 Sections 2-6 and 41 of this bill provide for the administration and enforcement of
42 section 1 in the same manner as other requirements imposed by existing law on
43 licensed health facilities.
44 Sections 25 and 54 of this bill authorize the Board of the Public Employees’
45 Benefits Program and the Public Option, which is a state-run health insurance
46 program for private citizens, to reduce the rates paid to a facility or practitioner who
47 violates any provision of section 33, 35-37, 39 or 40 or prohibit the facility or
48 practitioner from receiving payments through the Program or the Public Option.
49 (NRS 695K.200) Section 27 of this bill applies certain definitions to section 25.
50 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
51 Nevada law and employers who provide such insurance for their employees to
52 include coverage for drugs to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use
53 disorder; and (2) provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
54 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025, 608.1555, 689A.0459, 689B.0319,

57 private policies of health insurance, not including Medicaid, to cover drugs that are
58 alternatives to opioids for purposes for which opioids are commonly used. Sections
59 42, 43, 45-50 and 53 of this bill prohibit certain insurers from imposing prior
60 authorization and certain other conditions on covered opioid alternatives that are
61 not imposed on opioids. Section 44 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
-
*SB337_R1*
– 3 –
62 Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic
63 insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage required by
64 section 43. Sections 51 and 53.5 of this bill exempt certain policies of health
65 insurance that provide health care services to recipients of Medicaid or insurance
66 pursuant to the Children’s Health Insurance Program from requirements to cover
67 drugs that are alternatives to opioids for purposes for which opioids are commonly
68 used. Section 52 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
69 certification of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
70 requirements of section 50. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
71 such actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements
72 of sections 43, 45-49 and 53. (NRS 680A.200)
73 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
74 Services to create the Silver State Scripts Board (NRS 422.4035) Existing law
75 requires the Department to set the duties of the Board by regulation, including
76 identifying the prescription drugs which should be included on the list of preferred
77 prescription drugs for Medicaid. (NRS 422.405) Section 30.6 of this bill
78 additionally requires the Department to require the Board to review new classes of
79 therapeutic prescription drugs that include alternatives to opioids for inclusion on
80 that list.
81 Existing federal law requires a state to establish a Drug Use Review Board to
82 conduct certain reviews related to the use of prescription drugs under Medicaid. (42
83 U.S.C. § 1396r-8(g)(3)) Existing Nevada law requires the Drug Use Review Board
84 to develop step therapy protocols and prior authorization policies and procedures
85 for use by the Medicaid program for prescription drugs. (NRS 422.403) Section
86 30.3 of this bill additionally requires the Drug Use Review Board to regularly
87 review the step therapy protocols and prior authorization policies and procedures
88 applicable to drugs that are alternatives to opioids to ensure sufficient access by
89 recipients of Medicaid to such drugs.
90 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
91 certain litigation by the State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale and
92 marketing of opioids. (NRS 433.732) Existing law requires the Department to
93 create a statewide plan to allocate the money in the Fund for certain statewide
94 projects and grants to local governments and private-sector organizations whose
95 work relates to opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. (NRS
96 433.738) Section 31 of this bill requires the statewide plan to allocate at least 20
97 percent of the money distributed from the Fund to such projects and grants that are
98 related to the prevention of substance use disorders. Section 32 of this bill makes a
99 conforming change to update an internal reference changed by section 31. Section
100 55 authorizes the Department to continue to utilize the current statewide plan and at
101 the time that the Department revises the statewide plan or develops a new plan, the
102 new plan must comply with the provisions of section 31.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health care
facilities and certain providers of health care to provide
patients with a form for a non-opioid directive and offer
patients treatments that do not utilize an opioid under
certain circumstances; requiring the Division of Public
and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and
Human Services to create a form for a non-opioid
directive; requiring the Administrator of the Division to
appoint an advisory board to monitor compliance with
laws and regulations relating to the non-opioid directive;
requiring certain policies of health insurance to include
coverage for at least one drug that is an alternative to
opioids; requiring certain insurers to provide the form for
a non-opioid directive to new insureds; revising the
manner by which money in the Fund for a Resilient
Nevada allocates money to projects and grants; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient to execute certain directives and declarations
2 to record his or her wishes relating to health care and to direct providers of health
3 care in the provision of health care to the patient. (NRS 449A.400-449A.645)
4 Section 15 of this bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services to create a non-opioid directive, which
6 is a form on which a person may indicate that he or she does not wish to receive
-
*SB337_R1*

– 2 –
7 opioids, and to post the non-opioid directive on an Internet website maintained by
8 the Division. Section 16 of this bill requires: (1) certain practitioners to provide a
9 person with an opportunity to execute a non-opioid directive; (2) third party
10 insurers that provide health coverage to provide persons who enroll in such health
11 coverage a non-opioid directive; and (3) certain health care facilities to ensure that
12 persons providing care at the facility provide a patient with an opportunity to
13 execute a non-opioid directive. Section 16 also requires such third party insurers
14 and health facilities to post the non-opioid directive on their Internet websites.
15 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill set forth the procedure for a patient to execute and
16 revoke a non-opioid directive.
17 Section 19 of this bill prohibits a person who knows or should know that a
18 person has executed a non-opioid directive from prescribing, administering or
19 directing or supervising the administration of an opioid to that person except under
20 certain circumstances. Section 21 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to
21 adopt regulations prescribing procedures relating to the non-opioid directive.
22 Sections 22 and 23 of this bill require the Administrator of the Division to
23 appoint an advisory board to: (1) review the implementation of and compliance
24 with provisions relating to the non-opioid directive; and (2) make recommendations
25 to practitioner licensing boards and certain governmental entities concerning issues
26 relating to opioid use and alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids. Sections
27 8-14 of this bill define certain terms used in sections 8-23.
28 Sections 1 and 33-40 of this bill require a medical facility, certain other health
29 care facilities and certain practitioners who prescribe or administer opioids to
30 comply with the provisions of law governing non-opioid directives. Under section
31 55 of this bill, beginning on July 1, 2027, or 6 months after the date on which the
32 regulations relating to the non-opioid directives become effective, whichever is
33 later, sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require such facilities and practitioners to
34 offer and provide alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids to patients who
35 have requested such alternatives or executed non-opioid directives, except in
36 certain circumstances. Sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require the regulatory
37 bodies that license such facilities and practitioners to biennially review the
38 compliance of such facilities and practitioners with those requirements. Sections 34
39 and 38 make conforming changes to clarify that sections 33 and 37, respectively,
40 apply to the prescribing and administering of opioids to treat intractable pain.
41 Sections 2-6 and 41 of this bill provide for the administration and enforcement of
42 section 1 in the same manner as other requirements imposed by existing law on
43 licensed health facilities.
44 Sections 25 and 54 of this bill authorize the Board of the Public Employees’
45 Benefits Program and the Public Option, which is a state-run health insurance
46 program for private citizens, to reduce the rates paid to a facility or practitioner who
47 violates any provision of section 33, 35-37, 39 or 40 or prohibit the facility or
48 practitioner from receiving payments through the Program or the Public Option.
49 (NRS 695K.200) Section 27 of this bill applies certain definitions to section 25.
50 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
51 Nevada law and employers who provide such insurance for their employees to
52 include coverage for drugs to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use
53 disorder; and (2) provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
54 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025, 608.1555, 689A.0459, 689B.0319,
55 689C.1665, 689C.425, 695A.1874, 695B.19197, 695C.050, 695C.1699,
56 695G.1719) Sections 26, 28, 43, 45-50 and 53 of this bill require certain public and
57 private policies of health insurance, not including Medicaid, to cover drugs that are
58 alternatives to opioids for purposes for which opioids are commonly used. Sections
59 42, 43, 45-50 and 53 of this bill prohibit certain insurers from imposing prior
60 authorization and certain other conditions on covered opioid alternatives that are
61 not imposed on opioids. Section 44 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
-
*SB337_R1*

– 3 –
62 Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic
63 insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage required by
64 section 43. Sections 51 and 53.5 of this bill exempt certain policies of health
65 insurance that provide health care services to recipients of Medicaid or insurance
66 pursuant to the Children’s Health Insurance Program from requirements to cover
67 drugs that are alternatives to opioids for purposes for which opioids are commonly
68 used. Section 52 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
69 certification of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
70 requirements of section 50. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
71 such actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements
72 of sections 43, 45-49 and 53. (NRS 680A.200)
73 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
74 Services to create the Silver State Scripts Board (NRS 422.4035) Existing law
75 requires the Department to set the duties of the Board by regulation, including
76 identifying the prescription drugs which should be included on the list of preferred
77 prescription drugs for Medicaid. (NRS 422.405) Section 30.6 of this bill
78 additionally requires the Department to require the Board to review new classes of
79 therapeutic prescription drugs that include alternatives to opioids for inclusion on
80 that list.
81 Existing federal law requires a state to establish a Drug Use Review Board to
82 conduct certain reviews related to the use of prescription drugs under Medicaid. (42
83 U.S.C. § 1396r-8(g)(3)) Existing Nevada law requires the Drug Use Review Board
84 to develop step therapy protocols and prior authorization policies and procedures
85 for use by the Medicaid program for prescription drugs. (NRS 422.403) Section
86 30.3 of this bill additionally requires the Drug Use Review Board to regularly
87 review the step therapy protocols and prior authorization policies and procedures
88 applicable to drugs that are alternatives to opioids to ensure sufficient access by
89 recipients of Medicaid to such drugs.
90 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
91 certain litigation by the State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale and
92 marketing of opioids. (NRS 433.732) Existing law requires the Department to
93 create a statewide plan to allocate the money in the Fund for certain statewide
94 projects and grants to local governments and private-sector organizations whose
95 work relates to opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. (NRS
96 433.738) Section 31 of this bill requires the statewide plan to allocate at least 20
97 percent of the money distributed from the Fund to such projects and grants that are
98 related to the prevention of substance use disorders. Section 32 of this bill makes a
99 conforming change to update an internal reference changed by section 31. Section
100 55 authorizes the Department to continue to utilize the current statewide plan and at
101 the time that the Department revises the statewide plan or develops a new plan, the
102 new plan must comply with the provisions of section 31.
