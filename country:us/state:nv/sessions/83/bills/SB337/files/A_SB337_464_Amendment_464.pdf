AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health care facilities and certain
providers of health care to provide patients with a form for a non-
opioid directive and offer patients treatments that do not utilize an
opioid under certain circumstances; requiring the Division of Public
and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services to create a form for a non-opioid directive; requiring the
Administrator of the Division to appoint an advisory board to monitor
compliance with laws and regulations relating to the non-opioid
directive; requiring certain policies of health insurance to include
coverage for at least one drug that is an alternative to opioids; requiring
certain insurers to provide the form for a non-opioid directive to new
insureds; revising the manner by which money in the Fund for a
Resilient Nevada allocates money to projects and grants; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient to execute certain directives and declarations to record
2 his or her wishes relating to health care and to direct providers of health care in the provision
3 of health care to the patient. (NRS 449A.400-449A.645) Section 15 of this bill requires the
4 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to
5 create a non-opioid directive, which is a form on which a person may indicate that he or she
6 does not wish to receive opioids, and to post the non-opioid directive on an Internet website
7 maintained by the Division. Section 16 of this bill requires: (1) certain [providers of health
8 care] practitioners to provide a person with an opportunity to execute a non-opioid directive;
9 (2) third party insurers that provide health coverage to provide persons who enroll in such
10 health coverage a non-opioid directive; and (3) certain health care facilities to ensure that
11 persons providing care at the facility provide a patient with an opportunity to execute a non-
12 opioid directive. Section 16 also requires such third party insurers and health facilities to post
13 the non-opioid directive on their Internet websites. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill set forth the
14 procedure for a patient to execute and revoke a non-opioid directive.

Senate Amendment No. 464 to Senate Bill No. 337 Page 4
15 Section 19 of this bill prohibits a person who knows or should know that a person has
16 executed a non-opioid directive from prescribing, administering or directing or supervising the
17 administration of an opioid to that person except under certain circumstances. [Section 20 of
18 this bill provides immunity to certain persons relating to the prescribing, administering or
19 directing or supervising the administration of an opioid to a patient who has executed a non-
20 opioid directive, or the failure to take those actions with regard to such a patient, if the person:
21 (1) acts in good faith; and (2) is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
22 relating to his or her actions.] Section 21 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to
23 adopt regulations prescribing procedures relating to the non-opioid directive.
24 Sections 22 and 23 of this bill require the Administrator of the Division to appoint an
25 advisory board to: (1) review the implementation of and compliance with provisions relating
26 to the non-opioid directive; and (2) make recommendations to practitioner licensing boards
27 and certain governmental entities concerning issues relating to opioid use and alternative
28 treatments that do not utilize opioids. Sections 8-14 of this bill define certain terms used in
29 sections 8-23.
30 Sections 1 and 33-40 of this bill require a medical facility, certain other health care
31 facilities and certain [providers of health care] practitioners who prescribe or administer
32 opioids to comply with the provisions of law governing non-opioid directives. Under section
33 55 of this bill, beginning on [January] July 1, 2027, or 6 months after the date on which the
34 regulations relating to the non-opioid directives become effective, whichever is later,
35 sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require such facilities and [providers of health care]
36 practitioners to offer and provide alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids to patients
37 who have requested such alternatives or executed non-opioid directives, except in certain
38 circumstances. Sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require the regulatory bodies that license
39 such facilities and [providers of health care] practitioners to biennially review the
40 compliance of such facilities and practitioners with those requirements. Sections 34 and 38
41 make conforming changes to clarify that sections 33 and 37, respectively, apply to the
42 prescribing and administering of opioids to treat intractable pain. Sections 2-6 and 41 of this
43 bill provide for the administration and enforcement of section 1 in the same manner as other
44 requirements imposed by existing law on licensed health facilities.
45 Sections 25 and 54 of this bill authorize the Board of the Public Employees’ Benefits
46 Program and the Public Option, which is a state-run health insurance program for private
47 citizens, to reduce the rates paid to a facility or practitioner who violates any provision of
48 section 33, 35-37, 39 or 40 or prohibit the facility or practitioner from receiving payments
49 through the Program or the Public Option. (NRS 695K.200) Section 27 of this bill applies
50 certain definitions to section 25. [Section 29 of this bill requires the Administrator of the
51 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to adopt regulations to: (1)
52 monitor the compliance of facilities and practitioners who participate in Medicaid with the
53 provisions of sections 33, 35-37, 39 and 40; and (2) impose sanctions on a facility or
54 practitioner who fails to comply with such provisions.]
55 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under Nevada law
56 and employers who provide such insurance for their employees to include coverage for drugs
57 to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use disorder; and (2) provide medication-
58 assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025, 608.1555,
59 689A.0459, 689B.0319, 689C.1665, 689C.425, 695A.1874, 695B.19197, 695C.050,
60 695C.1699, 695G.1719) Sections 26, 28, [30,] 43, [45-51] 45-50 and 53 of this bill require
61 certain public and private policies of health insurance , not including Medicaid, to cover
62 drugs that are alternatives to opioids for purposes for which opioids are commonly used.
63 Sections 42, 43, [45-51] 45-50 and 53 of this bill prohibit certain insurers from imposing
64 prior authorization and certain other conditions on covered opioid alternatives that are not
65 imposed on opioids. Section 44 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to
66 require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who
67 resides in another state to include the coverage required by section 43. Sections 51 and 53.5
68 of this bill exempt certain policies of health insurance that provide health care services to
69 recipients of Medicaid or insurance pursuant to the Children’s Health Insurance
70 Program from requirements to cover drugs that are alternatives to opioids for purposes
71 for which opioids are commonly used. Section 52 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner
72 to suspend or revoke the certification of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
73 with the requirements of section 50. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such

Senate Amendment No. 464 to Senate Bill No. 337 Page 5
74 actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 43,
75 45-49 [, 51] and 53. (NRS 680A.200) [Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change to
76 require the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 29 in the same
77 manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.]
78 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
79 to create the Silver State Scripts Board (NRS 422.4035) Existing law requires the
80 Department to set the duties of the Board by regulation, including identifying the
81 prescription drugs which should be included on the list of preferred prescription drugs
82 for Medicaid. (NRS 422.405) Section 30.6 of this bill additionally requires the
83 Department to require the Board to review new classes of therapeutic prescription drugs
84 that include alternatives to opioids for inclusion on that list.
85 Existing federal law requires a state to establish a Drug Use Review Board to
86 conduct certain reviews related to the use of prescription drugs under Medicaid. (42
87 U.S.C. § 1396r-8(g)(3)) Existing Nevada law requires the Drug Use Review Board to
88 develop step therapy protocols and prior authorization policies and procedures for use
89 by the Medicaid program for prescription drugs. (NRS 422.403) Section 30.3 of this bill
90 additionally requires the Drug Use Review Board to regularly review the step therapy
91 protocols and prior authorization policies and procedures applicable to drugs that are
92 alternatives to opioids to ensure sufficient access by recipients of Medicaid to such drugs.
93 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of certain
94 litigation by the State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale and marketing of opioids.
95 (NRS 433.732) Existing law requires the Department to create a statewide plan to allocate the
96 money in the Fund for certain statewide projects and grants to local governments and private-
97 sector organizations whose work relates to opioid use disorder and other substance use
98 disorders. (NRS 433.738) Section 31 of this bill requires the statewide plan to allocate at least
99 20 percent of the money distributed from the Fund to such projects and grants that are related
100 to the prevention of substance use disorders. Section 32 of this bill makes a conforming
101 change to update an internal reference changed by section 31. Section 55 authorizes the
102 Department to continue to utilize the current statewide plan and at the time that the
103 Department revises the statewide plan or develops a new plan, the new plan must comply with
104 the provisions of section 31.
