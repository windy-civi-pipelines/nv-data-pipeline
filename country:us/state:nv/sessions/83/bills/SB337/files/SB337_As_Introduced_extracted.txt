24 in good faith; and (2) is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
25 relating to his or her actions. Section 21 of this bill requires the State Board of

37 Under section 55 of this bill, beginning on January 1, 2027, sections 1, 33, 35-37,
38 39 and 40 require such facilities and providers of health care to offer and provide
39 alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids to patients who have requested

41 Sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require the regulatory bodies that license such

62 include coverage for drugs to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use

74 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certification of a
75 health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of
76 section 50. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such actions
77 against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections
78 43, 45-49, 51 and 53. (NRS 680A.200) Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming
79 change to require the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of
80 section 29 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
81 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
82 certain litigation by the State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale and
83 marketing of opioids. (NRS 433.732) Existing law requires the Department to
84 create a statewide plan to allocate the money in the Fund for certain statewide
85 projects and grants to local governments and private-sector organizations whose
86 work relates to opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. (NRS
87 433.738) Section 31 of this bill requires the statewide plan to allocate at least 20
88 percent of the money distributed from the Fund to such projects and grants that are
89 related to the prevention of substance use disorders. Section 32 of this bill makes a
90 conforming change to update an internal reference changed by section 31. Section
91 55 authorizes the Department to continue to utilize the current statewide plan and at
92 the time that the Department revises the statewide plan or develops a new plan, the
93 new plan must comply with the provisions of section 31.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient to execute certain directives and declarations

-
*SB337*

– 2 –
7 opioids, and to post the non-opioid directive on an Internet website maintained by
8 the Division. Section 16 of this bill requires: (1) certain providers of health care to
9 provide a person with an opportunity to execute a non-opioid directive; (2) third
10 party insurers that provide health coverage to provide persons who enroll in such
11 health coverage a non-opioid directive; and (3) certain health care facilities to
12 ensure that persons providing care at the facility provide a patient with an
13 opportunity to execute a non-opioid directive. Section 16 also requires such third
14 party insurers and health facilities to post the non-opioid directive on their Internet
15 websites. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill set forth the procedure for a patient to
16 execute and revoke a non-opioid directive.
17 Section 19 of this bill prohibits a person who knows or should know that a
18 person has executed a non-opioid directive from prescribing, administering or
19 directing or supervising the administration of an opioid to that person except under
20 certain circumstances. Section 20 of this bill provides immunity to certain persons
21 relating to the prescribing, administering or directing or supervising the
22 administration of an opioid to a patient who has executed a non-opioid directive, or
23 the failure to take those actions with regard to such a patient, if the person: (1) acts
24 in good faith; and (2) is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
25 relating to his or her actions. Section 21 of this bill requires the State Board of
26 Health to adopt regulations prescribing procedures relating to the non-opioid
27 directive.
28 Sections 22 and 23 of this bill require the Administrator of the Division to
29 appoint an advisory board to: (1) review the implementation of and compliance
30 with provisions relating to the non-opioid directive; and (2) make recommendations
31 to practitioner licensing boards and certain governmental entities concerning issues
32 relating to opioid use and alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids. Sections
33 8-14 of this bill define certain terms used in sections 8-23.
34 Sections 1 and 33-40 of this bill require a medical facility, certain other health
35 care facilities and certain providers of health care who prescribe or administer
36 opioids to comply with the provisions of law governing non-opioid directives.
37 Under section 55 of this bill, beginning on January 1, 2027, sections 1, 33, 35-37,
38 39 and 40 require such facilities and providers of health care to offer and provide
39 alternative treatments that do not utilize opioids to patients who have requested
40 such alternatives or executed non-opioid directives, except in certain circumstances.
41 Sections 1, 33, 35-37, 39 and 40 require the regulatory bodies that license such
42 facilities and providers of health care to biennially review the compliance of such
43 facilities and practitioners with those requirements. Sections 34 and 38 make
44 conforming changes to clarify that sections 33 and 37, respectively, apply to the
45 prescribing and administering of opioids to treat intractable pain. Sections 2-6 and
46 41 of this bill provide for the administration and enforcement of section 1 in the
47 same manner as other requirements imposed by existing law on licensed health
48 facilities.
49 Sections 25 and 54 of this bill authorize the Board of the Public Employees’
50 Benefits Program and the Public Option, which is a state-run health insurance
51 program for private citizens, to reduce the rates paid to a facility or practitioner who
52 violates any provision of section 33, 35-37, 39 or 40 or prohibit the facility or
53 practitioner from receiving payments through the Program or the Public Option.
54 (NRS 695K.200) Section 27 of this bill applies certain definitions to section 25.
55 Section 29 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Health Care
56 Financing and Policy of the Department to adopt regulations to: (1) monitor the
57 compliance of facilities and practitioners who participate in Medicaid with the
58 provisions of sections 33, 35-37, 39 and 40; and (2) impose sanctions on a facility
59 or practitioner who fails to comply with such provisions.
60 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
61 Nevada law and employers who provide such insurance for their employees to
-
*SB337*

– 3 –
62 include coverage for drugs to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use
63 disorder; and (2) provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
64 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025, 608.1555, 689A.0459, 689B.0319,
65 689C.1665, 689C.425, 695A.1874, 695B.19197, 695C.050, 695C.1699,
66 695G.1719) Sections 26, 28, 30, 43, 45-51 and 53 of this bill require certain public
67 and private policies of health insurance to cover drugs that are alternatives to
68 opioids for purposes for which opioids are commonly used. Sections 42, 43, 45-51
69 and 53 of this bill prohibit certain insurers from imposing prior authorization and
70 certain other conditions on covered opioid alternatives that are not imposed on
71 opioids. Section 44 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require
72 certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who
73 resides in another state to include the coverage required by section 43. Section 52
74 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certification of a
75 health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of
76 section 50. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such actions
77 against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections
78 43, 45-49, 51 and 53. (NRS 680A.200) Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming
79 change to require the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of
80 section 29 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
81 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
82 certain litigation by the State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale and
83 marketing of opioids. (NRS 433.732) Existing law requires the Department to
84 create a statewide plan to allocate the money in the Fund for certain statewide
85 projects and grants to local governments and private-sector organizations whose
86 work relates to opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders. (NRS
87 433.738) Section 31 of this bill requires the statewide plan to allocate at least 20
88 percent of the money distributed from the Fund to such projects and grants that are
89 related to the prevention of substance use disorders. Section 32 of this bill makes a
90 conforming change to update an internal reference changed by section 31. Section
91 55 authorizes the Department to continue to utilize the current statewide plan and at
92 the time that the Department revises the statewide plan or develops a new plan, the
93 new plan must comply with the provisions of section 31.
