Section 1:
Growth and Infrastructure
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; removing the prospective
expiration of certain requirements relating to the recording,
retention and review of information concerning traffic stops
made by law enforcement officers; revising certain reporting
requirements for law enforcement agencies and certain third
parties with whom the Department of Public Safety contracts;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) prescribes certain requirements relating to the recording,
retention and reporting of information concerning traffic stops made by law
enforcement officers; and (2) in general, makes these requirements applicable
during a period that ends on February 1, 2026. (NRS 484B.830, 484B.833)

Section 2:
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill remove the prospective expiration of these
requirements, thereby making permanent the requirements relating to the recording,
retention and reporting of information concerning traffic stops made by law
enforcement officers.
Under existing law, one such requirement provides that each law enforcement
agency that engages in traffic stops for which certain citations or warnings are
issued must annually report to the Department of Public Safety certain information
concerning such stops. (NRS 484B.830, 484B.833) Existing law authorizes the
Department to contract with a third party to: (1) review all public information,
including, without limitation, information reported to the Department by law
enforcement agencies; and (2) conduct a statistical analysis of the data for the
purpose of identifying patterns or practices of profiling. If the Department enters
into such a contract, existing law requires a third party with whom the Department
contracts to report the results of the statistical analysis to the Governor, the
Department and the Chairs of the Senate and Assembly Standing Committees on
Judiciary. (NRS 484B.837) Section 2.5 of this bill instead requires that any such
report be submitted to the Governor, the Department and: (1) if the report is
prepared during an even-numbered year, the next regular session of the Legislature;
or (2) if the report is prepared during an odd-numbered year, the Joint Interim
Standing Committee on the Judiciary.
