AN ACT relating to public safety; removing the prospective expiration of certain
requirements relating to the recording, retention and review of
information concerning traffic stops made by law enforcement officers;
revising certain reporting requirements for law enforcement agencies
[;] and certain third parties with whom the Department of Public
Safety contracts; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prescribes certain requirements relating to the recording, retention and
2 reporting of information concerning traffic stops made by law enforcement officers; and (2) in
3 general, makes these requirements applicable during a period that ends on February 1, 2026.
4 (NRS 484B.830, 484B.833) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill remove the prospective expiration of
5 these requirements, thereby making permanent the requirements relating to the recording,
6 retention and reporting of information concerning traffic stops made by law enforcement
7 officers.
8 Under existing law, one such requirement provides that each law enforcement agency that
9 engages in traffic stops for which certain citations or warnings are issued must annually report
10 to the Department of Public Safety certain information concerning such stops. (NRS
11 484B.830, 484B.833) [Sections 1 and 2 also require each such law enforcement agency]
12 Existing law authorizes the Department to contract with a third party to: (1) review all
13 public information, including, without limitation, information reported to the
14 Department by law enforcement agencies; and (2) conduct a statistical analysis of the
15 data for the purpose of identifying patterns or practices of profiling. If the Department
16 enters into such a contract, existing law requires a third party with whom the
17 Department contracts to report the [information] results of the statistical analysis to the [:
18 (1) Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to] Governor, the Department
19 and the Chairs of the Senate and Assembly Standing Committees on Judiciary . [in odd-

20 numbered years; and (2) Joint Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary in even-numbered
21 years.] (NRS 484B.837) Section 2.5 of this bill instead requires that any such report be
22 submitted to the Governor, the Department and: (1) if the report is prepared during an
23 even-numbered year, the next regular session of the Legislature; or (2) if the report is
24 prepared during an odd-numbered year, the Joint Interim Standing Committee on the
25 Judiciary.
