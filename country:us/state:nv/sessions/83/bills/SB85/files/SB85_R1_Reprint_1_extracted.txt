EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; removing the prospective
expiration of certain requirements relating to the
recording, retention and review of information concerning
traffic stops made by law enforcement officers; revising
certain reporting requirements for law enforcement
agencies and certain third parties with whom the
Department of Public Safety contracts; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prescribes certain requirements relating to the recording,
2 retention and reporting of information concerning traffic stops made by law
3 enforcement officers; and (2) in general, makes these requirements applicable
4 during a period that ends on February 1, 2026. (NRS 484B.830, 484B.833)
5 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill remove the prospective expiration of these
6 requirements, thereby making permanent the requirements relating to the recording,
7 retention and reporting of information concerning traffic stops made by law
8 enforcement officers.
9 Under existing law, one such requirement provides that each law enforcement
10 agency that engages in traffic stops for which certain citations or warnings are
11 issued must annually report to the Department of Public Safety certain information
12 concerning such stops. (NRS 484B.830, 484B.833) Existing law authorizes the
13 Department to contract with a third party to: (1) review all public information,
-

– 2 –
14 including, without limitation, information reported to the Department by law
15 enforcement agencies; and (2) conduct a statistical analysis of the data for the
16 purpose of identifying patterns or practices of profiling. If the Department enters
17 into such a contract, existing law requires a third party with whom the Department
18 contracts to report the results of the statistical analysis to the Governor, the
19 Department and the Chairs of the Senate and Assembly Standing Committees on
20 Judiciary. (NRS 484B.837) Section 2.5 of this bill instead requires that any such
21 report be submitted to the Governor, the Department and: (1) if the report is
22 prepared during an even-numbered year, the next regular session of the Legislature;
23 or (2) if the report is prepared during an odd-numbered year, the Joint Interim
24 Standing Committee on the Judiciary.
