EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; establishing provisions relating to the inspection
of certain vehicles; revising provisions relating to the rescission and
cancellation of the registration of a vehicle under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle in an unauthorized speed contest or in
2 an unauthorized trick driving display on a highway or premises to which the public has access.
3 (NRS 484B.653) Section 3 of this bill provides that if a peace officer, while investigating an
4 act that may constitute driving in an unauthorized speed contest or in an unauthorized trick
5 driving display, has reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle used or suspected of being
6 used in the unauthorized speed contest or unauthorized trick driving display fails to comply
7 with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is unsafe under certain
8 circumstances, the peace officer must inspect the vehicle to determine whether those
9 conditions exist. Section 3 authorizes the peace officer to issue a citation to the registered
10 owner of the vehicle if the peace officer determines from the inspection that the conditions
11 exist.
12 Existing law provides that a court may, in addition to certain other penalties, order the
13 impoundment of a vehicle used in the commission of certain offenses related to unauthorized
14 speed contests or unauthorized trick driving displays. (NRS 484B.653) If a court issues an
15 order for impoundment, section 5 of this bill also requires the court to issue an order
16 requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to rescind and cancel the registration of the
17 vehicle unless the registered owner completes an inspection of the vehicle in the manner
18 prescribed by section 1 of this bill. Section 5 [of this bill] requires the court to forward a
19 copy of the order for impoundment and the order for recission and cancellation of
20 registration to the Department . [of Motor Vehicles.]
21 [Section 4 of this bill requires the Department, upon receipt of the copy of the order for
22 impoundment, to cause a peace officer or inspector of the Department to travel to the place of
23 impoundment to view the vehicle. Section 4 provides that if a peace officer or an inspector of
24 the Department has reasonable cause to believe that the impounded vehicle fails to comply
25 with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is unsafe under certain
26 circumstances, the peace officer or inspector of the Department must inspect the impounded
27 vehicle to determine whether those conditions exist. Section 4 authorizes the peace officer or
28 inspector of the Department to issue a citation or notice of violation to the registered owner of
29 the vehicle if the peace officer or inspector of the Department determines from the inspection
30 that the conditions exist.]
Assembly Amendment No. 137 to Assembly Bill No. 417 Page 4
31 Existing law requires the Department to rescind and cancel the registration of a vehicle if
32 the registered owner of the vehicle is issued a citation or notice of violation for failure to
33 comply with certain requirements concerning emissions and the owner does not provide proof
34 to the Department that the condition has been corrected within 30 days after the issuance of
35 the citation or notice of violation. (NRS 482.460) Section 1 [of this bill] additionally requires
36 the Department to rescind and cancel the registration of a vehicle if the registered owner of the
37 vehicle : (1) is issued a citation or notice of a violation pursuant to section 3 [or 4] and the
38 owner does not provide proof to the Department that the condition has been corrected within
39 30 days after the issuance of the citation or notice of violation [.] ; or (2) is the subject of an
40 order of impoundment and order for rescission and cancellation of registration pursuant
41 to section 5 and the owner does not prove through an inspection of the vehicle that the
42 vehicle complies with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is otherwise
43 not in an unsafe condition within 30 days of the last date of impound.
44 Finally, section 1 authorizes the Department to extend the time by which the
45 registered owner must provide the specified proof to the Department before the
46 rescission and cancellation of the registration.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle in an unauthorized speed contest or in
2 an unauthorized trick driving display on a highway or premises to which the public has access.
3 (NRS 484B.653) Section 3 of this bill provides that if a peace officer, while investigating an
4 act that may constitute driving in an unauthorized speed contest or in an unauthorized trick
5 driving display, has reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle used or suspected of being
6 used in the unauthorized speed contest or unauthorized trick driving display fails to comply
7 with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is unsafe under certain
8 circumstances, the peace officer must inspect the vehicle to determine whether those
9 conditions exist. Section 3 authorizes the peace officer to issue a citation to the registered
10 owner of the vehicle if the peace officer determines from the inspection that the conditions
11 exist.
12 Existing law provides that a court may, in addition to certain other penalties, order the
13 impoundment of a vehicle used in the commission of certain offenses related to unauthorized
14 speed contests or unauthorized trick driving displays. (NRS 484B.653) If a court issues an
15 order for impoundment, section 5 of this bill also requires the court to issue an order
16 requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to rescind and cancel the registration of the
17 vehicle unless the registered owner completes an inspection of the vehicle in the manner
18 prescribed by section 1 of this bill. Section 5 [of this bill] requires the court to forward a
19 copy of the order for impoundment and the order for recission and cancellation of
20 registration to the Department . [of Motor Vehicles.]
21 [Section 4 of this bill requires the Department, upon receipt of the copy of the order for
22 impoundment, to cause a peace officer or inspector of the Department to travel to the place of
23 impoundment to view the vehicle. Section 4 provides that if a peace officer or an inspector of
24 the Department has reasonable cause to believe that the impounded vehicle fails to comply
25 with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is unsafe under certain
26 circumstances, the peace officer or inspector of the Department must inspect the impounded
27 vehicle to determine whether those conditions exist. Section 4 authorizes the peace officer or
28 inspector of the Department to issue a citation or notice of violation to the registered owner of
29 the vehicle if the peace officer or inspector of the Department determines from the inspection
30 that the conditions exist.]

31 Existing law requires the Department to rescind and cancel the registration of a vehicle if
32 the registered owner of the vehicle is issued a citation or notice of violation for failure to
33 comply with certain requirements concerning emissions and the owner does not provide proof
34 to the Department that the condition has been corrected within 30 days after the issuance of
35 the citation or notice of violation. (NRS 482.460) Section 1 [of this bill] additionally requires
36 the Department to rescind and cancel the registration of a vehicle if the registered owner of the
37 vehicle : (1) is issued a citation or notice of a violation pursuant to section 3 [or 4] and the
38 owner does not provide proof to the Department that the condition has been corrected within
39 30 days after the issuance of the citation or notice of violation [.] ; or (2) is the subject of an
40 order of impoundment and order for rescission and cancellation of registration pursuant
41 to section 5 and the owner does not prove through an inspection of the vehicle that the
42 vehicle complies with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is otherwise
43 not in an unsafe condition within 30 days of the last date of impound.
44 Finally, section 1 authorizes the Department to extend the time by which the
45 registered owner must provide the specified proof to the Department before the
46 rescission and cancellation of the registration.
