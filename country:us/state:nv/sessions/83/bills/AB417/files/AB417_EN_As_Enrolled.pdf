Assembly Bill No. 417–Assemblymembers Hunt; Considine,
D’Silva, Flanagan, González, Karris and Nadeem
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; establishing provisions relating to
the inspection of certain vehicles; revising provisions relating
to the rescission and cancellation of the registration of a
vehicle under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle in an unauthorized speed
contest or in an unauthorized trick driving display on a highway or premises to
which the public has access. (NRS 484B.653) Section 3 of this bill provides that if
a peace officer, while investigating an act that may constitute driving in an
unauthorized speed contest or in an unauthorized trick driving display, has
reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle used or suspected of being used in the
unauthorized speed contest or unauthorized trick driving display fails to comply
with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is unsafe under certain
circumstances, the peace officer must inspect the vehicle to determine whether
those conditions exist. Section 3 authorizes the peace officer to issue a citation to
the registered owner of the vehicle if the peace officer determines from the
inspection that the conditions exist.
Existing law provides that a court may, in addition to certain other penalties,
order the impoundment of a vehicle used in the commission of certain offenses
related to unauthorized speed contests or unauthorized trick driving displays. (NRS
484B.653) If a court issues an order for impoundment, section 5 of this bill also
requires the court to issue an order requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to
rescind and cancel the registration of the vehicle unless the registered owner
completes an inspection of the vehicle in the manner prescribed by section 1 of this
bill. Section 5 requires the court to forward a copy of the order for impoundment
and the order for recission and cancellation of registration to the Department.
Existing law requires the Department to rescind and cancel the registration of a
vehicle if the registered owner of the vehicle is issued a citation or notice of
violation for failure to comply with certain requirements concerning emissions and
the owner does not provide proof to the Department that the condition has been
corrected within 30 days after the issuance of the citation or notice of violation.
(NRS 482.460) Section 1 additionally requires the Department to rescind and
cancel the registration of a vehicle if the registered owner of the vehicle: (1) is
issued a citation or notice of a violation pursuant to section 3 and the owner does
not provide proof to the Department that the condition has been corrected within 30
days after the issuance of the citation or notice of violation; or (2) is the subject of
an order of impoundment and order for rescission and cancellation of registration
pursuant to section 5 and the owner does not prove through an inspection of the
vehicle that the vehicle complies with certain requirements related to vehicle
equipment or is otherwise not in an unsafe condition within 30 days of the last date
of impound.
Finally, section 1 authorizes the Department to extend the time by which the
registered owner must provide the specified proof to the Department before the
rescission and cancellation of the registration.
