12 inspection that the conditions exist.
13 Existing law provides that a court may, in addition to certain other penalties,
14 order the impoundment of a vehicle used in the commission of certain offenses
15 related to unauthorized speed contests or unauthorized trick driving displays. (NRS

17 impoundment to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
18 Section 4 of this bill requires the Department, upon receipt of the copy of the
