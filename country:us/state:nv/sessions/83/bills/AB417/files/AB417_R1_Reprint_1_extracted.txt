EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; establishing provisions relating to
the inspection of certain vehicles; revising provisions
relating to the rescission and cancellation of the
registration of a vehicle under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle in an unauthorized speed
2 contest or in an unauthorized trick driving display on a highway or premises to
3 which the public has access. (NRS 484B.653) Section 3 of this bill provides that if
4 a peace officer, while investigating an act that may constitute driving in an
5 unauthorized speed contest or in an unauthorized trick driving display, has
6 reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle used or suspected of being used in the
7 unauthorized speed contest or unauthorized trick driving display fails to comply
8 with certain requirements related to vehicle equipment or is unsafe under certain
9 circumstances, the peace officer must inspect the vehicle to determine whether
10 those conditions exist. Section 3 authorizes the peace officer to issue a citation to
11 the registered owner of the vehicle if the peace officer determines from the
12 inspection that the conditions exist.
13 Existing law provides that a court may, in addition to certain other penalties,
14 order the impoundment of a vehicle used in the commission of certain offenses
15 related to unauthorized speed contests or unauthorized trick driving displays. (NRS
16 484B.653) If a court issues an order for impoundment, section 5 of this bill also
17 requires the court to issue an order requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to
18 rescind and cancel the registration of the vehicle unless the registered owner
19 completes an inspection of the vehicle in the manner prescribed by section 1 of this
20 bill. Section 5 requires the court to forward a copy of the order for impoundment
21 and the order for recission and cancellation of registration to the Department.
22 Existing law requires the Department to rescind and cancel the registration of a
23 vehicle if the registered owner of the vehicle is issued a citation or notice of
-
*AB417_R1*
– 2 –
24 violation for failure to comply with certain requirements concerning emissions and
25 the owner does not provide proof to the Department that the condition has been
26 corrected within 30 days after the issuance of the citation or notice of violation.
27 (NRS 482.460) Section 1 additionally requires the Department to rescind and
28 cancel the registration of a vehicle if the registered owner of the vehicle: (1) is
29 issued a citation or notice of a violation pursuant to section 3 and the owner does
30 not provide proof to the Department that the condition has been corrected within 30
31 days after the issuance of the citation or notice of violation; or (2) is the subject of
32 an order of impoundment and order for rescission and cancellation of registration
33 pursuant to section 5 and the owner does not prove through an inspection of the
34 vehicle that the vehicle complies with certain requirements related to vehicle
35 equipment or is otherwise not in an unsafe condition within 30 days of the last date
36 of impound.
37 Finally, section 1 authorizes the Department to extend the time by which the
38 registered owner must provide the specified proof to the Department before the
39 rescission and cancellation of the registration.
