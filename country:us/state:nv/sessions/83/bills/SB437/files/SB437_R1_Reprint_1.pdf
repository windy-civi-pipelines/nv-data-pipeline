EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to financial services; setting forth certain
requirements for a contract between an Internet consumer
lender and a resident of this State for the provision of a
loan; authorizing an Internet consumer lender to apply for
a license to engage in the business of lending for an office
or place of business located outside this State without
having a license for an office or place of business located
inside this State; exempting Internet consumer lenders
from provisions prohibiting a person from conducting the
business of making loans in the same office or place of
business as any other business; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending in this
2 State without having first obtained a license from the Commissioner of Financial
3 Institutions for each office or other place of business in which the person engages
4 in the business of lending. (NRS 675.060) Under existing law, a person who wishes
5 to obtain a license for an office or place of business located outside this State is
6 required to have a license for an office or place of business located inside this State,
7 unless the person is an Internet business lender, which existing law defines to mean
8 a person who makes business loans exclusively through the Internet. (NRS
9 675.020, 675.090) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes an Internet
10 consumer lender to apply for a license to engage in the business of lending for an
11 office or place of business located outside this State without having a license for an
12 office or place of business located inside this State. Section 2 of this bill defines the
13 term “Internet consumer lender” to mean a person who makes, solicits, brokers,
14 arranges or facilitates consumer loans exclusively through the Internet.
15 Existing law exempts Internet business lenders from provisions of existing law
16 which prohibit persons, with certain exceptions, from conducting the business of

17 making loans in the same office or place of business as any other business. (NRS
18 675.230) Section 4 of this bill similarly exempts Internet consumer lenders from
19 those provisions.
20 Section 1 of this bill requires any contract between an Internet consumer lender
21 and a resident of this State for the provision of a loan to: (1) provide that the
22 contract is governed by the laws of this State; and (2) require that any process for
23 the resolution of disputes arising out of the contract occur in this State. Under
24 section 1, any condition, stipulation or provision in such a contract that conflicts
25 with such requirements is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.
