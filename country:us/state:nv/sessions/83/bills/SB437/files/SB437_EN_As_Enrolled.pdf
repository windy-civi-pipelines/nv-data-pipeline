Senate Bill No. 437–Committee on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to financial services; setting forth certain
requirements for a contract between an Internet consumer
lender and a resident of this State for the provision of a loan;
authorizing an Internet consumer lender to apply for a license
to engage in the business of lending for an office or place of
business located outside this State without having a license
for an office or place of business located inside this State;
exempting Internet consumer lenders from provisions
prohibiting a person from conducting the business of making
loans in the same office or place of business as any other
business; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending in this
State without having first obtained a license from the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions for each office or other place of business in which the person engages
in the business of lending. (NRS 675.060) Under existing law, a person who wishes
to obtain a license for an office or place of business located outside this State is
required to have a license for an office or place of business located inside this State,
unless the person is an Internet business lender, which existing law defines to mean
a person who makes business loans exclusively through the Internet. (NRS
675.020, 675.090) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes an Internet
consumer lender to apply for a license to engage in the business of lending for an
office or place of business located outside this State without having a license for an
office or place of business located inside this State. Section 2 of this bill defines the
term “Internet consumer lender” to mean a person who makes, solicits, brokers,
arranges or facilitates consumer loans exclusively through the Internet.
Existing law exempts Internet business lenders from provisions of existing law
which prohibit persons, with certain exceptions, from conducting the business of
making loans in the same office or place of business as any other business. (NRS
675.230) Section 4 of this bill similarly exempts Internet consumer lenders from
those provisions.
Section 1 of this bill requires any contract between an Internet consumer lender
and a resident of this State for the provision of a loan to: (1) provide that the
contract is governed by the laws of this State; and (2) require that any process for
the resolution of disputes arising out of the contract occur in this State. Under
section 1, any condition, stipulation or provision in such a contract that conflicts
with such requirements is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.
