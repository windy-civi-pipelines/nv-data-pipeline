AN ACT relating to financial services; setting forth certain requirements for a
contract between an Internet consumer lender and a resident of this
State for the provision of a loan; authorizing an Internet consumer
lender to apply for a license to engage in the business of lending for an
office or place of business located outside this State without having a
license for an office or place of business located inside this State;
exempting Internet consumer lenders from provisions prohibiting a
person from conducting the business of making loans in the same
office or place of business as any other business; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending in this State
2 without having first obtained a license from the Commissioner of Financial Institutions for
3 each office or other place of business in which the person engages in the business of lending.
4 (NRS 675.060) Under existing law, a person who wishes to obtain a license for an office or
5 place of business located outside this State is required to have a license for an office or place
6 of business located inside this State, unless the person is an Internet business lender, which
7 existing law defines to mean a person who makes business loans exclusively through the
8 Internet. (NRS 675.020, 675.090) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes an Internet
9 consumer lender to apply for a license to engage in the business of lending for an office or
10 place of business located outside this State without having a license for an office or place of
11 business located inside this State. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “Internet consumer
12 lender” to mean a person who makes , solicits, brokers, arranges or facilitates consumer
13 loans exclusively through the Internet.
14 Existing law exempts Internet business lenders from provisions of existing law which
15 prohibit persons, with certain exceptions, from conducting the business of making loans in the
16 same office or place of business as any other business. (NRS 675.230) Section 4 of this bill
17 similarly exempts Internet consumer lenders from those provisions.
18 Section 1 of this bill requires any contract between an Internet consumer lender and a
19 resident of this State for the provision of a loan to: (1) provide that the contract is governed by
20 the laws of this State; and (2) require that any process for the resolution of disputes arising out
21 of the contract occur in this State. Under section 1, any condition, stipulation or provision in
Senate Amendment No. 325 to Senate Bill No. 437 Page 4
22 such a contract that conflicts with such requirements is contrary to public policy and is void
23 and unenforceable.
