7 Existing law requires, among other qualifications, a person to have practiced as a
-
*AB225*
– 2 –
8 licensed apprentice under the supervision of a licensed barber to be qualified to
9 receive a license as a barber. (NRS 643.070) Section 2 of this bill requires licensed
10 barbers who supervise apprentices who participate in certain apprenticeship
11 programs to train the apprentices in all subjects of practical work and related
12 supplemental instruction for the scope of a license as a barber.
13 Section 3 of this bill defines certain words and terms for the purposes of
14 provisions governing barbers and the practice of barbering. Section 4 of this bill
15 exempts persons engaging in certain practices from the application of the
16 provisions governing barbers and the practice of barbering.
17 Existing law sets forth the qualifications for a person to receive a license as a
18 barber. (NRS 643.070) Section 5 of this bill: (1) allows a person to complete
19 certain training in a federally-registered apprenticeship program in lieu of certain
20 other training requirements to obtain a license; (2) allows a person to complete a
21 certain number of hours in a school of barbering in lieu of serving as an apprentice
22 or satisfying certain other requirements to obtain a license; and (3) eliminates
23 certain requirements for licensure.
24 Existing law sets forth the qualifications for a person to receive a license as an
25 apprentice. (NRS 643.080) Section 6 of this bill eliminates certain requirements for
26 such a license, including the requirement to have graduated from a school of
27 barbering approved by the Board. Sections 6 and 9 of this bill exempt a person
28 who is participating in a federally-registered apprenticeship program from the
29 requirement of passing an examination conducted by the Board.
30 Existing law requires each applicant for a license as a barber or an apprentice to
31 file a verified application for an examination before the State Barbers’ Health and
32 Sanitation Board. (NRS 643.090) Section 7 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
33 requirement that the applicant file a physician’s certification that the applicant is
34 free from tuberculosis and other communicable diseases; and (2) exempts a person
35 who is participating in a federally-registered apprenticeship program from
36 complying with the requirement to apply for an examination before the Board.
37 Existing law requires a person who has a license or certificate as a barber or
38 apprentice from certain other jurisdictions whose requirements for licensing barbers
39 and apprentices are substantially the same as the requirements of this State to be
40 admitted to practice as a licensed barber or apprentice, pursuant to regulations
41 adopted by the Board. (NRS 643.120) Section 8 of this bill also requires a person
42 who has a license or certificate for a scope of practice that is substantially the same
43 as the practice of barbering to be admitted to practice as a licensed barber or
44 apprentice, as applicable, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Board.
45 Existing law requires the display of the license of each licensed barber and
46 apprentice and the regulations of the Board to be displayed in a barbershop or
47 barber school. (NRS 643.150) Section 10 of this bill requires a barbershop to make
48 disclosures in certain forms to a customer who is to receive a service from an
49 apprentice who is participating in a federally-registered apprenticeship program.
50 Existing law prohibits a person from operating a barbershop unless the Board
51 has issued to that person a license to operate a barbershop. (NRS 643.171) Section
52 11 of this bill provides that: (1) a person who holds a license to operate a
53 barbershop is not prohibited from leasing space to, employing or working in the
54 same space as a person who is licensed under provisions governing cosmetology;
55 and (2) a licensed barber and a person who is licensed under provisions governing
56 cosmetology who work in the same barbershop are not required to work in different
57 spaces in the barbershop or to have partitions between them.

59 to issue a license as an instructor to a person who: (1) holds a license as an
60 instructor of cosmetology issued by the State Board of Cosmetology; (2) has
61 applied to the State Barbers’ Health and Sanitation Board; (3) has paid the
-

62 applicable fees; and (4) submits all information required to complete the
63 application.
64 Section 47 of this bill repeals certain provisions relating to the: (1) examination
65 for licensure as a hair braider or shampoo technologist; and (2) registration of
66 makeup artists.
67 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the State Board of
68 Cosmetology of persons engaged in various branches of cosmetology, including
69 shampoo technologists and hair braiders, persons engaged in makeup artistry,
70 cosmetological establishments and schools of cosmetology. (Chapter 644A of
71 NRS) Section 20 of this bill exempts from the provisions governing the licensure
72 and regulation of persons licensed by the Board a person engaged in the practice of
73 shampoo technology, hair braiding or makeup artistry if the person engages in no
74 other practice which requires a license under this chapter. Thus, a person who
75 restricts his or her activities to only those specified under existing law as
76 constituting the practice of shampoo technology, hair braiding or makeup artistry is
77 not required to obtain a license from the Board. Section 14 of this bill defines
78 “blow-dry styling” to include certain practices involving hair and section 20 also
79 exempts persons engaged only in those activities from the provisions governing the
80 licensure and regulation of persons licensed by the Board. Sections 17, 18, 21, 34-
81 37, 39, 40 and 42-47 of this bill eliminate references to shampoo technologists, hair
82 braiders and makeup artists in provisions governing the licensure and regulation of
83 persons licensed by the Board.
84 Sections 22, 24, 26, 27, 29 and 31 of this bill revise the requirements for the
85 admission of a person to examination for a license as a cosmetologist, hair designer,
86 advanced esthetician, esthetician, nail technologist or electrologist, respectively, to,
87 among other things, allow certain training requirements to be fulfilled by
88 completing training in a federally-registered apprenticeship program, as defined in
89 section 15 of this bill.
90 Sections 23, 25, 28 and 30 of this bill revise the requirements for the issuance
91 of a certificate of registration as a cosmetologist’s apprentice, hair designer’s
92 apprentice, esthetician’s apprentice and nail technologist’s apprentice, respectively,
93 to, among other things, allow for such a certificate of registration to be issued to
94 persons in a federally-registered apprenticeship program.
95 Section 33 of this bill eliminates the requirement that a person who is licensed
96 under the laws of another state or territory of the United States or the District of
97 Columbia provide proof satisfactory to the State Board of Cosmetology that the
98 person is of good moral character to be granted a license to practice the occupation
99 in which the applicant was previously licensed.
100 Section 41 of this bill revise certain provisions governing the procedures for
101 the training and practice of apprentices for cosmetologists, estheticians,
102 electrologists, hair designers and nail technologists.
103 Existing law authorizes a licensed operator of a cosmetological establishment
104 to lease space to or employ a barber. (NRS 644A.615) Section 42 of this bill
105 authorizes an operator of a cosmetological establishment or a person who is
106 licensed under provisions governing cosmetology to work in the same space as a
107 barber in the cosmetological establishment.
108 Existing law provides that, unless a person is licensed or registered in
109 accordance with the provisions governing the occupations of cosmetology and
110 related practices, it is unlawful for the person to: (1) conduct or operate a
111 cosmetological establishment, a school of cosmetology or any other place of
112 business in which any one or combination of the occupations of cosmetology are
113 taught or practiced unless the person is licensed or registered in accordance with the
114 provisions governing the occupations of cosmetology and related practices; or (2)
115 engage in, or attempt to engage in, the practice of cosmetology. (NRS 644A.900)
116 Section 46 of this bill specifies that the prohibition does not prohibit a person who
-

– 4 –
117 participates in a federally-registered apprenticeship program from engaging in the
118 practice for which the apprenticeship is offered in collaboration with the provider
119 of the apprenticeship.

4 massage therapy.

6 barbers by the State Barbers’ Health and Sanitation Board. (Chapter 643 of NRS)
7 Existing law requires, among other qualifications, a person to have practiced as a
-
*AB225*

– 2 –
8 licensed apprentice under the supervision of a licensed barber to be qualified to
9 receive a license as a barber. (NRS 643.070) Section 2 of this bill requires licensed
10 barbers who supervise apprentices who participate in certain apprenticeship
11 programs to train the apprentices in all subjects of practical work and related
12 supplemental instruction for the scope of a license as a barber.
13 Section 3 of this bill defines certain words and terms for the purposes of
14 provisions governing barbers and the practice of barbering. Section 4 of this bill
15 exempts persons engaging in certain practices from the application of the
16 provisions governing barbers and the practice of barbering.
17 Existing law sets forth the qualifications for a person to receive a license as a
18 barber. (NRS 643.070) Section 5 of this bill: (1) allows a person to complete
19 certain training in a federally-registered apprenticeship program in lieu of certain
20 other training requirements to obtain a license; (2) allows a person to complete a
21 certain number of hours in a school of barbering in lieu of serving as an apprentice
22 or satisfying certain other requirements to obtain a license; and (3) eliminates
23 certain requirements for licensure.
24 Existing law sets forth the qualifications for a person to receive a license as an
25 apprentice. (NRS 643.080) Section 6 of this bill eliminates certain requirements for
26 such a license, including the requirement to have graduated from a school of
27 barbering approved by the Board. Sections 6 and 9 of this bill exempt a person
28 who is participating in a federally-registered apprenticeship program from the
29 requirement of passing an examination conducted by the Board.
30 Existing law requires each applicant for a license as a barber or an apprentice to
31 file a verified application for an examination before the State Barbers’ Health and
32 Sanitation Board. (NRS 643.090) Section 7 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
33 requirement that the applicant file a physician’s certification that the applicant is
34 free from tuberculosis and other communicable diseases; and (2) exempts a person
35 who is participating in a federally-registered apprenticeship program from
36 complying with the requirement to apply for an examination before the Board.
37 Existing law requires a person who has a license or certificate as a barber or
38 apprentice from certain other jurisdictions whose requirements for licensing barbers
39 and apprentices are substantially the same as the requirements of this State to be
40 admitted to practice as a licensed barber or apprentice, pursuant to regulations
41 adopted by the Board. (NRS 643.120) Section 8 of this bill also requires a person
42 who has a license or certificate for a scope of practice that is substantially the same
43 as the practice of barbering to be admitted to practice as a licensed barber or
44 apprentice, as applicable, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Board.
45 Existing law requires the display of the license of each licensed barber and
46 apprentice and the regulations of the Board to be displayed in a barbershop or
47 barber school. (NRS 643.150) Section 10 of this bill requires a barbershop to make
48 disclosures in certain forms to a customer who is to receive a service from an
49 apprentice who is participating in a federally-registered apprenticeship program.
50 Existing law prohibits a person from operating a barbershop unless the Board
51 has issued to that person a license to operate a barbershop. (NRS 643.171) Section
52 11 of this bill provides that: (1) a person who holds a license to operate a
53 barbershop is not prohibited from leasing space to, employing or working in the
54 same space as a person who is licensed under provisions governing cosmetology;
55 and (2) a licensed barber and a person who is licensed under provisions governing
56 cosmetology who work in the same barbershop are not required to work in different
57 spaces in the barbershop or to have partitions between them.
58 Section 12 of this bill requires the State Barbers’ Health and Sanitation Board
59 to issue a license as an instructor to a person who: (1) holds a license as an
60 instructor of cosmetology issued by the State Board of Cosmetology; (2) has
61 applied to the State Barbers’ Health and Sanitation Board; (3) has paid the
-
*AB225*

– 3 –
62 applicable fees; and (4) submits all information required to complete the
63 application.
64 Section 47 of this bill repeals certain provisions relating to the: (1) examination
65 for licensure as a hair braider or shampoo technologist; and (2) registration of
66 makeup artists.
67 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the State Board of
68 Cosmetology of persons engaged in various branches of cosmetology, including
69 shampoo technologists and hair braiders, persons engaged in makeup artistry,
70 cosmetological establishments and schools of cosmetology. (Chapter 644A of
71 NRS) Section 20 of this bill exempts from the provisions governing the licensure
72 and regulation of persons licensed by the Board a person engaged in the practice of
73 shampoo technology, hair braiding or makeup artistry if the person engages in no
74 other practice which requires a license under this chapter. Thus, a person who
75 restricts his or her activities to only those specified under existing law as
76 constituting the practice of shampoo technology, hair braiding or makeup artistry is
77 not required to obtain a license from the Board. Section 14 of this bill defines
78 “blow-dry styling” to include certain practices involving hair and section 20 also
79 exempts persons engaged only in those activities from the provisions governing the
80 licensure and regulation of persons licensed by the Board. Sections 17, 18, 21, 34-
81 37, 39, 40 and 42-47 of this bill eliminate references to shampoo technologists, hair
82 braiders and makeup artists in provisions governing the licensure and regulation of
83 persons licensed by the Board.
84 Sections 22, 24, 26, 27, 29 and 31 of this bill revise the requirements for the
85 admission of a person to examination for a license as a cosmetologist, hair designer,
86 advanced esthetician, esthetician, nail technologist or electrologist, respectively, to,
87 among other things, allow certain training requirements to be fulfilled by
88 completing training in a federally-registered apprenticeship program, as defined in
89 section 15 of this bill.
90 Sections 23, 25, 28 and 30 of this bill revise the requirements for the issuance
91 of a certificate of registration as a cosmetologist’s apprentice, hair designer’s
92 apprentice, esthetician’s apprentice and nail technologist’s apprentice, respectively,
93 to, among other things, allow for such a certificate of registration to be issued to
94 persons in a federally-registered apprenticeship program.
95 Section 33 of this bill eliminates the requirement that a person who is licensed
96 under the laws of another state or territory of the United States or the District of
97 Columbia provide proof satisfactory to the State Board of Cosmetology that the
98 person is of good moral character to be granted a license to practice the occupation
99 in which the applicant was previously licensed.
100 Section 41 of this bill revise certain provisions governing the procedures for
101 the training and practice of apprentices for cosmetologists, estheticians,
102 electrologists, hair designers and nail technologists.
103 Existing law authorizes a licensed operator of a cosmetological establishment
104 to lease space to or employ a barber. (NRS 644A.615) Section 42 of this bill
105 authorizes an operator of a cosmetological establishment or a person who is
106 licensed under provisions governing cosmetology to work in the same space as a
107 barber in the cosmetological establishment.
108 Existing law provides that, unless a person is licensed or registered in
109 accordance with the provisions governing the occupations of cosmetology and
110 related practices, it is unlawful for the person to: (1) conduct or operate a
111 cosmetological establishment, a school of cosmetology or any other place of
112 business in which any one or combination of the occupations of cosmetology are
113 taught or practiced unless the person is licensed or registered in accordance with the
114 provisions governing the occupations of cosmetology and related practices; or (2)
115 engage in, or attempt to engage in, the practice of cosmetology. (NRS 644A.900)
116 Section 46 of this bill specifies that the prohibition does not prohibit a person who
-

– 4 –
117 participates in a federally-registered apprenticeship program from engaging in the
118 practice for which the apprenticeship is offered in collaboration with the provider
119 of the apprenticeship.
