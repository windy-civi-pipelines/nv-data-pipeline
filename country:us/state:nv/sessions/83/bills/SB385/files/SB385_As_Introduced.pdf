1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application for such
5 credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria and has entered
6 into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for the abatement.

10 Office that includes a workforce development plan that provides for the
11 implementation by the applicant of a workforce development program which meets
12 certain requirements, including that the program is provided by certain educational

16 abatement is complying with the terms of the workforce development plan; and (2)
17 require a recipient to repay the amount of the abatement or partial abatement or an
18 amount equal to the amount of transferable tax credits, plus interest, if the
19 Executive Director of the Office determines that the recipient has not substantially
20 complied with the terms of the workforce development plan. Sections 7 and 8 of
21 this bill make conforming changes to update references to provisions renumbered
22 by section 2. Section 13 of this bill makes the requirements of this bill relating to
23 workforce development plans applicable only to an application for certain
24 transferable tax credits or certain abatements made on or after July 1, 2025.
