EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for
political action to use money in its campaign finance
account for certain purposes; clarifying that nonprofit
organizations or corporations are not a committee for
political action for purposes of campaign finance
requirements; revising provisions relating to the disposal
of unspent campaign contributions; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1
2 week after receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or
3 more, open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the
4 United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)
5 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a committee for political action to use money in the
6 account for certain purposes.
7 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of a “committee for political action”
8 to exclude from the definition any nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation
9 duly organized under federal law or under the laws of this State, any other state, the
10 District of Columbia or any territory of the United States.
11 Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a
12 candidate or former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected
13 to office may use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a
14 candidate who is defeated is required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS
15 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a candidate who is defeated to use
16 unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If, within 4 years, such a
17 candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an official ballot at
18 any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
19 contributions.

20 Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not
21 run for reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a
22 circumstance, existing law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of
23 within 4 years if the former public officer does not file a declaration of candidacy
24 or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill instead requires any
25 former public officer to dispose of unspent contributions not later than 15 days after
26 the 4-year period immediately following leaving office.
27 Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former
28 officer who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions,
29 and for whom the time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such
30 contributions has yet to expire, to dispose of such contributions not later than 4
31 years from the effective date of this bill.
