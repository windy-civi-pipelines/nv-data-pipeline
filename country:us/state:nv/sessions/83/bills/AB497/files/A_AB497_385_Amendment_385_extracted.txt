EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for political action
to use money in its campaign finance account for certain purposes;
clarifying that nonprofit organizations or corporations are not a
committee for political action for purposes of campaign finance
requirements; revising provisions relating to the disposal of unspent
campaign contributions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1 week after
2 receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or more, open and
3 maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the United States for the
4 deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
5 committee for political action to use money in the account for certain purposes.
6 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude
7 from the definition any nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized under
8 federal law or under the laws of this State, any other state, the District of Columbia or any
9 territory of the United States.
10 Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a candidate or
11 former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected to office may use
12 unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a candidate who is defeated is
13 required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
14 a candidate who is defeated to use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If,
15 within 4 years, such a candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an
16 official ballot at any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
17 contributions.
18 Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not run for
19 reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a circumstance, existing
20 law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of within 4 years if the former public
21 officer does not file a declaration of candidacy or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160)
22 Section 3 of this bill instead requires any former public officer to dispose of unspent
23 contributions not later than [the 15th day of the second month] 15 days after the 4-year
24 period immediately following leaving office.
25 Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former
26 officer who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions, and
27 for whom the time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such contributions
Assembly Amendment No. 385 to Assembly Bill No. 497 Page 4
28 has yet to expire, to dispose of such contributions not later than 4 years from the
29 effective date of this bill.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for political action
to use money in its campaign finance account for certain purposes;
clarifying that nonprofit organizations or corporations are not a
committee for political action for purposes of campaign finance
requirements; revising provisions relating to the disposal of unspent
campaign contributions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1 week after
2 receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or more, open and
3 maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the United States for the
4 deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
5 committee for political action to use money in the account for certain purposes.
6 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude
7 from the definition any nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized under
8 federal law or under the laws of this State, any other state, the District of Columbia or any
9 territory of the United States.
10 Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a candidate or
11 former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected to office may use
12 unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a candidate who is defeated is
13 required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
14 a candidate who is defeated to use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If,
15 within 4 years, such a candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an
16 official ballot at any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
17 contributions.
18 Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not run for
19 reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a circumstance, existing
20 law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of within 4 years if the former public
21 officer does not file a declaration of candidacy or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160)
22 Section 3 of this bill instead requires any former public officer to dispose of unspent
23 contributions not later than [the 15th day of the second month] 15 days after the 4-year
24 period immediately following leaving office.
25 Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former
26 officer who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions, and
27 for whom the time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such contributions

Assembly Amendment No. 385 to Assembly Bill No. 497 Page 4
28 has yet to expire, to dispose of such contributions not later than 4 years from the
29 effective date of this bill.
