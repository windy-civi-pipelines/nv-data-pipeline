SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to campaign finance. (BDR 24-996)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for political action
to use money in its campaign finance account for certain purposes;
[clarifying] providing that [nonprofit] a labor union and certain
business organizations [or] and corporations are not a committee for
political action for purposes of campaign finance requirements;
revising provisions relating to the disposal of unspent campaign
contributions; requiring certain persons that are not committees for
political action to report certain expenditures; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1 week after
2 receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or more, open and
3 maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the United States for the
4 deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
5 committee for political action to use money in the account for certain purposes.
6 Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations and
7 other business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the definition of a
8 “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 2 of this bill revises the
9 definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude from the definition : (1) any
10 nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized under federal law or under the
11 laws of this State, any other state, the District of Columbia or any territory of the United
12 States [.] ; (2) all individual corporations and business organizations that have filed
13 certain organizational information with the Secretary of State; and (3) all labor unions.
14 Existing law requires certain persons, committees and political parties to report
15 certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS 294A.210) Section 3.5 of
16 this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of “committee for political
17 action” pursuant to section 2 that makes certain expenditures in excess of $1,000 to
18 report such expenditures.
19 Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a candidate or
20 former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected to office may use
21 unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a candidate who is defeated is
22 required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
23 a candidate who is defeated to use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If,
24 within 4 years, such a candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an
Senate Amendment No. 642 to Assembly Bill No. 497 First Reprint Page 4
25 official ballot at any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
26 contributions.
27 Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not run for
28 reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a circumstance, existing
29 law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of within 4 years if the former public
30 officer does not file a declaration of candidacy or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160)
31 Section 3 of this bill instead requires any former public officer to dispose of unspent
32 contributions not later than 15 days after the 4-year period immediately following leaving
33 office.
34 Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former officer
35 who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions, and for whom the
36 time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such contributions has yet to expire, to
37 dispose of such contributions not later than [4 years from the effective date of this bill.]

_______________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to campaign finance. (BDR 24-996)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for political action
to use money in its campaign finance account for certain purposes;
[clarifying] providing that [nonprofit] a labor union and certain
business organizations [or] and corporations are not a committee for
political action for purposes of campaign finance requirements;
revising provisions relating to the disposal of unspent campaign
contributions; requiring certain persons that are not committees for
political action to report certain expenditures; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1 week after
2 receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or more, open and
3 maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the United States for the
4 deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
5 committee for political action to use money in the account for certain purposes.
6 Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations and
7 other business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the definition of a
8 “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 2 of this bill revises the
9 definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude from the definition : (1) any
10 nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized under federal law or under the
11 laws of this State, any other state, the District of Columbia or any territory of the United
12 States [.] ; (2) all individual corporations and business organizations that have filed
13 certain organizational information with the Secretary of State; and (3) all labor unions.
14 Existing law requires certain persons, committees and political parties to report
15 certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS 294A.210) Section 3.5 of
16 this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of “committee for political
17 action” pursuant to section 2 that makes certain expenditures in excess of $1,000 to
18 report such expenditures.
19 Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a candidate or
20 former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected to office may use
21 unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a candidate who is defeated is
22 required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
23 a candidate who is defeated to use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If,
24 within 4 years, such a candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an

Senate Amendment No. 642 to Assembly Bill No. 497 First Reprint Page 4
25 official ballot at any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
26 contributions.
27 Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not run for
28 reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a circumstance, existing
29 law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of within 4 years if the former public
30 officer does not file a declaration of candidacy or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160)
31 Section 3 of this bill instead requires any former public officer to dispose of unspent
32 contributions not later than 15 days after the 4-year period immediately following leaving
33 office.
34 Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former officer
35 who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions, and for whom the
36 time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such contributions has yet to expire, to
37 dispose of such contributions not later than [4 years from the effective date of this bill.]
38 October 1, 2029.
