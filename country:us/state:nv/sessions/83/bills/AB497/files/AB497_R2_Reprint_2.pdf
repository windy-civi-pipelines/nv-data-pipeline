EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for
political action to use money in its campaign finance
account for certain purposes; providing that a labor union
and certain business organizations and corporations are
not a committee for political action for purposes of
campaign finance requirements; revising provisions
relating to the disposal of unspent campaign
contributions; requiring certain persons that are not
committees for political action to report certain
expenditures; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1
2 week after receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or
3 more, open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the
4 United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)
5 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a committee for political action to use money in the
6 account for certain purposes.
7 Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations
8 and other business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the
9 definition of a “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 2 of this
10 bill revises the definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude from the
11 definition: (1) any nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized
12 under federal law or under the laws of this State, any other state, the District of
13 Columbia or any territory of the United States; (2) all individual corporations and
14 business organizations that have filed certain organizational information with the
15 Secretary of State; and (3) all labor unions.
16 Existing law requires certain persons, committees and political parties to report
17 certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS 294A.210)

18 Section 3.5 of this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of
19 “committee for political action” pursuant to section 2 that makes certain
20 expenditures in excess of $1,000 to report such expenditures.
21 Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a
22 candidate or former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected
23 to office may use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a
24 candidate who is defeated is required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS
25 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a candidate who is defeated to use
26 unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If, within 4 years, such a
27 candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an official ballot at
28 any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
29 contributions.
30 Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not
31 run for reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a
32 circumstance, existing law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of
33 within 4 years if the former public officer does not file a declaration of candidacy
34 or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill instead requires any
35 former public officer to dispose of unspent contributions not later than 15 days after
36 the 4-year period immediately following leaving office.
37 Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former
38 officer who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions,
39 and for whom the time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such
40 contributions has yet to expire, to dispose of such contributions not later than
41 October 1, 2029.
