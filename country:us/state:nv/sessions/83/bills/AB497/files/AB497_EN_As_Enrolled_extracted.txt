Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for
political action to use money in its campaign finance account
for certain purposes; providing that a labor union and certain
business organizations and corporations are not a committee
for political action for purposes of campaign finance
requirements; revising provisions relating to the disposal of
unspent campaign contributions; requiring certain persons
that are not committees for political action to report certain
expenditures; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1
week after receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or
more, open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the
United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill authorizes a committee for political action to use money in the
account for certain purposes.
Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations
and other business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the
definition of a “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 2 of this
bill revises the definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude from the
definition: (1) any nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized
under federal law or under the laws of this State, any other state, the District of
Columbia or any territory of the United States; (2) all individual corporations and
business organizations that have filed certain organizational information with the
Secretary of State; and (3) all labor unions.
Existing law requires certain persons, committees and political parties to report
certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS 294A.210) Section

Section 3:
3.5 of this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of “committee for
political action” pursuant to section 2 that makes certain expenditures in excess of
$1,000 to report such expenditures.
Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a
candidate or former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected
to office may use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a
candidate who is defeated is required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS
294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a candidate who is defeated to use
unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If, within 4 years, such a
candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an official ballot at
any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
contributions.
Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not
run for reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a
circumstance, existing law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of
within 4 years if the former public officer does not file a declaration of candidacy
or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill instead requires any
former public officer to dispose of unspent contributions not later than 15 days after
the 4-year period immediately following leaving office.

Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former
officer who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions,
and for whom the time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such
contributions has yet to expire, to dispose of such contributions not later than
October 1, 2029.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 497–Assemblymember Yeager
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to campaign finance; authorizing a committee for
political action to use money in its campaign finance account
for certain purposes; providing that a labor union and certain
business organizations and corporations are not a committee
for political action for purposes of campaign finance
requirements; revising provisions relating to the disposal of
unspent campaign contributions; requiring certain persons
that are not committees for political action to report certain
expenditures; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires every committee for political action to, not later than 1
week after receiving contributions the sum of which, in the aggregate is $1,000 or
more, open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution located in the
United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)
Section 1 of this bill authorizes a committee for political action to use money in the
account for certain purposes.
Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations
and other business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the
definition of a “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 2 of this
bill revises the definition of a “committee for political action” to exclude from the
definition: (1) any nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation duly organized
under federal law or under the laws of this State, any other state, the District of
Columbia or any territory of the United States; (2) all individual corporations and
business organizations that have filed certain organizational information with the
Secretary of State; and (3) all labor unions.
Existing law requires certain persons, committees and political parties to report
certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS 294A.210) Section
3.5 of this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of “committee for
political action” pursuant to section 2 that makes certain expenditures in excess of
$1,000 to report such expenditures.
Existing law governs the disposition of unspent campaign contributions by a
candidate or former public officer. Under existing law, a candidate who is elected
to office may use unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election, but a
candidate who is defeated is required to dispose of unspent contributions. (NRS
294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a candidate who is defeated to use
unspent contributions in the candidate’s next election. If, within 4 years, such a
candidate doesn’t file a declaration of candidacy or appear on an official ballot at
any election, section 3 requires the defeated candidate to dispose of unspent
contributions.
Existing law authorizes certain former public officers who resigned or did not
run for reelection to use unspent contributions in a future election. In such a
circumstance, existing law requires such unspent contributions to be disposed of
within 4 years if the former public officer does not file a declaration of candidacy
or appear on the ballot. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill instead requires any
former public officer to dispose of unspent contributions not later than 15 days after
the 4-year period immediately following leaving office.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Section 4 of this bill requires any candidate who was defeated and any former
officer who resigned or did not run for reelection who have unspent contributions,
and for whom the time period in which he or she is required to dispose of such
contributions has yet to expire, to dispose of such contributions not later than
October 1, 2029.
