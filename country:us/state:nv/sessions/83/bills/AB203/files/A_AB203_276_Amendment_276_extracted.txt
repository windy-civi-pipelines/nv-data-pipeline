Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments
2 involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of
3 NRS) [Section 1 of this bill creates the Social Equity Liaison within the Board. Section 1
4 requires the Executive Director of the Board to appoint a person to serve in the position of
5 Social Equity Liaison and sets forth the duties of that position.]
6 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements relating
7 to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 2
8 of this bill prohibits those requirements from requiring : (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis
9 products which is sold at wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag
10 necessary for the functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
11 cannabis adopted by the Board [.] ; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any
Assembly Amendment No. 276 to Assembly Bill No. 203 Page 4
12 information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already included
13 on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 9 of this bill revises
14 requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products for the purpose of allowing
15 information required to be included on a label to instead be included on packaging.
16 Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of this bill define the terms “label” and “packaging” for the
17 purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of
18 cannabis. Section 1.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions set
19 forth in sections 1.3 and 1.5 to the provisions of existing law governing the medical and
20 adult use of cannabis.
21 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of an adult-use or medical
22 cannabis establishment unless the person holds an adult-use or medical cannabis
23 establishment license, as applicable, issued by the Board. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250)
24 Sections 5-7 of this bill provide an exception from that prohibition for certain cannabis-
25 related businesses operated pursuant to a joint-venture agreement with a licensed cannabis
26 cultivation facility or cannabis production facility. Section 5 authorizes a person who does not
27 hold a license issued by the Board and who has been adversely affected by provisions of
28 previous laws which criminalized activities relating to cannabis to enter into such a joint-
29 venture agreement with such a cannabis establishment to operate a cannabis-related business
30 on the premises of the establishment. Section 5: (1) authorizes such a business to engage in
31 any activity in which the cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis production facility that is a
32 party to the joint-venture agreement is authorized to engage; and (2) sets forth various
33 requirements for such a joint-venture agreement and the operation of such a business.
34 Sections 12 and 17 of this bill provide an exception from state prosecution for certain crimes
35 relating to cannabis for a person who has entered into a joint-venture agreement that has been
36 approved by the Board pursuant to section 5. Section 16 of this bill provides that the fact that
37 a person has entered into such an agreement does not, alone: (1) constitute probable cause to
38 search the person or the person’s property; or (2) subject the person or the person’s property to
39 inspection.
40 [Existing law imposes certain excise taxes on certain wholesale and retail sales of
41 cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS 372A.290) Section 23 of this bill exempts from those
42 excise taxes any sale of cannabis or a cannabis product that was produced by a business
43 operating pursuant to a joint-venture agreement pursuant to section 5.]
44 Existing law requires an applicant for an adult-use cannabis establishment license to
45 submit to the Board, among other things, evidence that the applicant controls certain liquid
46 assets. (NRS 678B.250) Section 7 exempts from that requirement a social equity applicant
47 who is applying for the issuance of an adult-use cannabis establishment license for an
48 independent cannabis consumption lounge. Section 8 of this bill removes provisions requiring
49 the Board to set forth certain restrictions on the transfer of an adult-use cannabis establishment
50 license for an independent cannabis consumption lounge.
51 [Section 9 of this bill authorizes a cannabis production facility to produce and sell to a
52 cannabis sales facility a non-infused pre-roll.]
53 Existing law requires the Board to adopt certain regulations to carry out the provisions of
54 existing law governing the licensing and control of cannabis. (NRS 678B.650) Section 10 of
55 this bill prohibits those regulations from requiring: (1) a cannabis sales facility to maintain a
56 visitor’s log; and (2) a cannabis establishment to maintain records concerning sales
57 transactions for more than 3 years. Section 10 additionally requires those regulations to allow
58 certain [employees] agents of a cannabis establishment to conduct a quarterly inventory, if
59 such a quarterly inventory is required by the Board. Sections 13-15 of this bill make
60 conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 10.
61 Section 11 of this bill revises the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a
62 plant of the genus Cannabis.
63 Existing law authorizes a cannabis sales facility to contract with a third party or
64 intermediary business to deliver cannabis or cannabis products. (NRS 678C.440, 678D.430)
65 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a cannabis sales facility or a third party or intermediary
66 business with whom the cannabis sales facility has contracted to deliver cannabis or cannabis
67 products to a consumer at any location so long as the location is not [within a certain distance
68 from] on the property of a school, community facility or airport or , with certain
69 exceptions, within a certain distance from a gaming establishment. Section 4 additionally
Assembly Amendment No. 276 to Assembly Bill No. 203 Page 5
70 prohibits the Board from requiring a vehicle used for such deliveries to be inspected by the
71 Board before making such a delivery.
72 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to destroy marijuana that has been
73 seized from a defendant without prior court approval under certain circumstances. (NRS
74 52.400) Section 18 of this bill specifies that the Board constitutes a law enforcement agency
75 for the purposes of that authorization.
76 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross receipts of the
77 retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State. (NRS 372.105, 374.110,
78 374.111) Sections 19 and 25 of this bill clarify that the provisions of existing law governing
79 the imposition, collection and remittance of the sales taxes apply to a retailer who makes a
80 retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products regardless of whether the retailer holds a license
81 issued by the Board.
82 Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to impose upon any person
83 who does not hold a license issued by the Board and who sells cannabis or a cannabis product
84 an administrative fine in the amount of the excise tax on cannabis for which the person would
85 have been liable had the person engaged in the sale as an adult-use cannabis cultivation
86 facility or adult-use cannabis retail store. Sections 21, 22 and 24 of this bill make conforming
87 changes to provide that the definitions in existing law apply to section 20 and to clarify that
88 certain provisions of existing law apply to section 20.
89 Existing law sets forth the primary functions and responsibilities of the Investigation
90 Division of the Department of Public Safety. (NRS 480.140) Section 26 of this bill [makes]
91 additionally authorizes the Division [primarily responsible] to collaborate with the Board
92 and other state and local agencies for the enforcement of criminal laws relating to
93 unlicensed cannabis activities.
94 [Existing law requires employees of a cannabis establishment to complete certain training
95 courses relating to occupational health and safety. (NRS 618.9940-618.9950) Section 27 of
96 this bill excludes a cannabis sales facility from the definition of the term “cannabis
97 establishment” for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing those
98 requirements, thereby exempting an employee of a cannabis sales facility from those
99 requirements.]
100 Section 28 of this bill requires the Board and the Nevada Gaming Control Board, on or
101 before December 31, 2026, to jointly prepare and submit a report concerning the relationship
102 between the gaming industry and the cannabis industry in this State to the Governor and the
103 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.

Cannabis Compliance Board;] revising certain requirements relating to
the packaging, labeling and delivery of cannabis and cannabis
products; authorizing certain persons to enter into a joint-venture
agreement with certain cannabis establishments; revising provisions

the Department of Public Safety; [exempting an employee of a
cannabis sales facility from certain training requirements;] requiring
the Board and the Nevada Gaming Control Board to prepare a report

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments
2 involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of
3 NRS) [Section 1 of this bill creates the Social Equity Liaison within the Board. Section 1
4 requires the Executive Director of the Board to appoint a person to serve in the position of
5 Social Equity Liaison and sets forth the duties of that position.]
6 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements relating
7 to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 2
8 of this bill prohibits those requirements from requiring : (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis
9 products which is sold at wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag
10 necessary for the functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
11 cannabis adopted by the Board [.] ; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any

Assembly Amendment No. 276 to Assembly Bill No. 203 Page 4
12 information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already included
13 on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 9 of this bill revises
14 requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products for the purpose of allowing
15 information required to be included on a label to instead be included on packaging.
16 Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of this bill define the terms “label” and “packaging” for the
17 purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of
18 cannabis. Section 1.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions set
19 forth in sections 1.3 and 1.5 to the provisions of existing law governing the medical and
20 adult use of cannabis.
21 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of an adult-use or medical
22 cannabis establishment unless the person holds an adult-use or medical cannabis
23 establishment license, as applicable, issued by the Board. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250)
24 Sections 5-7 of this bill provide an exception from that prohibition for certain cannabis-
25 related businesses operated pursuant to a joint-venture agreement with a licensed cannabis
26 cultivation facility or cannabis production facility. Section 5 authorizes a person who does not
27 hold a license issued by the Board and who has been adversely affected by provisions of
28 previous laws which criminalized activities relating to cannabis to enter into such a joint-
29 venture agreement with such a cannabis establishment to operate a cannabis-related business
30 on the premises of the establishment. Section 5: (1) authorizes such a business to engage in
31 any activity in which the cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis production facility that is a
32 party to the joint-venture agreement is authorized to engage; and (2) sets forth various
33 requirements for such a joint-venture agreement and the operation of such a business.
34 Sections 12 and 17 of this bill provide an exception from state prosecution for certain crimes
35 relating to cannabis for a person who has entered into a joint-venture agreement that has been
36 approved by the Board pursuant to section 5. Section 16 of this bill provides that the fact that
37 a person has entered into such an agreement does not, alone: (1) constitute probable cause to
38 search the person or the person’s property; or (2) subject the person or the person’s property to
39 inspection.
40 [Existing law imposes certain excise taxes on certain wholesale and retail sales of
41 cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS 372A.290) Section 23 of this bill exempts from those
42 excise taxes any sale of cannabis or a cannabis product that was produced by a business
43 operating pursuant to a joint-venture agreement pursuant to section 5.]
44 Existing law requires an applicant for an adult-use cannabis establishment license to
45 submit to the Board, among other things, evidence that the applicant controls certain liquid
46 assets. (NRS 678B.250) Section 7 exempts from that requirement a social equity applicant
47 who is applying for the issuance of an adult-use cannabis establishment license for an
48 independent cannabis consumption lounge. Section 8 of this bill removes provisions requiring
49 the Board to set forth certain restrictions on the transfer of an adult-use cannabis establishment
50 license for an independent cannabis consumption lounge.
51 [Section 9 of this bill authorizes a cannabis production facility to produce and sell to a
52 cannabis sales facility a non-infused pre-roll.]
53 Existing law requires the Board to adopt certain regulations to carry out the provisions of
54 existing law governing the licensing and control of cannabis. (NRS 678B.650) Section 10 of
55 this bill prohibits those regulations from requiring: (1) a cannabis sales facility to maintain a
56 visitor’s log; and (2) a cannabis establishment to maintain records concerning sales
57 transactions for more than 3 years. Section 10 additionally requires those regulations to allow
58 certain [employees] agents of a cannabis establishment to conduct a quarterly inventory, if
59 such a quarterly inventory is required by the Board. Sections 13-15 of this bill make
60 conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 10.
61 Section 11 of this bill revises the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a
62 plant of the genus Cannabis.
63 Existing law authorizes a cannabis sales facility to contract with a third party or
64 intermediary business to deliver cannabis or cannabis products. (NRS 678C.440, 678D.430)
65 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a cannabis sales facility or a third party or intermediary
66 business with whom the cannabis sales facility has contracted to deliver cannabis or cannabis
67 products to a consumer at any location so long as the location is not [within a certain distance
68 from] on the property of a school, community facility or airport or , with certain
69 exceptions, within a certain distance from a gaming establishment. Section 4 additionally

Assembly Amendment No. 276 to Assembly Bill No. 203 Page 5
70 prohibits the Board from requiring a vehicle used for such deliveries to be inspected by the
71 Board before making such a delivery.
72 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to destroy marijuana that has been
73 seized from a defendant without prior court approval under certain circumstances. (NRS
74 52.400) Section 18 of this bill specifies that the Board constitutes a law enforcement agency
75 for the purposes of that authorization.
76 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross receipts of the
77 retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State. (NRS 372.105, 374.110,
78 374.111) Sections 19 and 25 of this bill clarify that the provisions of existing law governing
79 the imposition, collection and remittance of the sales taxes apply to a retailer who makes a
80 retail sale of cannabis or cannabis products regardless of whether the retailer holds a license
81 issued by the Board.
82 Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to impose upon any person
83 who does not hold a license issued by the Board and who sells cannabis or a cannabis product
84 an administrative fine in the amount of the excise tax on cannabis for which the person would
85 have been liable had the person engaged in the sale as an adult-use cannabis cultivation
86 facility or adult-use cannabis retail store. Sections 21, 22 and 24 of this bill make conforming
87 changes to provide that the definitions in existing law apply to section 20 and to clarify that
88 certain provisions of existing law apply to section 20.
89 Existing law sets forth the primary functions and responsibilities of the Investigation
90 Division of the Department of Public Safety. (NRS 480.140) Section 26 of this bill [makes]
91 additionally authorizes the Division [primarily responsible] to collaborate with the Board
92 and other state and local agencies for the enforcement of criminal laws relating to
93 unlicensed cannabis activities.
94 [Existing law requires employees of a cannabis establishment to complete certain training
95 courses relating to occupational health and safety. (NRS 618.9940-618.9950) Section 27 of
96 this bill excludes a cannabis sales facility from the definition of the term “cannabis
97 establishment” for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing those
98 requirements, thereby exempting an employee of a cannabis sales facility from those
99 requirements.]
100 Section 28 of this bill requires the Board and the Nevada Gaming Control Board, on or
101 before December 31, 2026, to jointly prepare and submit a report concerning the relationship
102 between the gaming industry and the cannabis industry in this State to the Governor and the
103 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
