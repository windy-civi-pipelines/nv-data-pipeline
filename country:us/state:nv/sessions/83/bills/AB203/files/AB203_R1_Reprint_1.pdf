Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
2 establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
3 Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS)
4 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
5 requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
6 products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 2 of this bill prohibits those requirements from
7 requiring: (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at
-
*AB203_R1*

– 2 –
8 wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the
9 functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
10 cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any
11 information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already
12 included on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 9 of this
13 bill revises requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products for the
14 purpose of allowing information required to be included on a label to instead be
15 included on packaging. Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of this bill define the terms “label”
16 and “packaging” for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the
17 medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 1.7 of this bill makes a conforming
18 change to apply the definitions set forth in sections 1.3 and 1.5 to the provisions of
19 existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of an adult-use or
21 medical cannabis establishment unless the person holds an adult-use or medical
22 cannabis establishment license, as applicable, issued by the Board. (NRS 678B.210,
23 678B.250) Sections 5-7 of this bill provide an exception from that prohibition for
24 certain cannabis-related businesses operated pursuant to a joint-venture agreement
25 with a licensed cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis production facility. Section
26 5 authorizes a person who does not hold a license issued by the Board and who has
27 been adversely affected by provisions of previous laws which criminalized
28 activities relating to cannabis to enter into such a joint-venture agreement with such
29 a cannabis establishment to operate a cannabis-related business on the premises of
30 the establishment. Section 5: (1) authorizes such a business to engage in any
31 activity in which the cannabis cultivation facility or cannabis production facility
32 that is a party to the joint-venture agreement is authorized to engage; and (2) sets
33 forth various requirements for such a joint-venture agreement and the operation of
34 such a business. Sections 12 and 17 of this bill provide an exception from state
35 prosecution for certain crimes relating to cannabis for a person who has entered into
36 a joint-venture agreement that has been approved by the Board pursuant to section
37 5. Section 16 of this bill provides that the fact that a person has entered into such an
38 agreement does not, alone: (1) constitute probable cause to search the person or the
39 person’s property; or (2) subject the person or the person’s property to inspection.
40 Existing law requires an applicant for an adult-use cannabis establishment
41 license to submit to the Board, among other things, evidence that the applicant
42 controls certain liquid assets. (NRS 678B.250) Section 7 exempts from that
43 requirement a social equity applicant who is applying for the issuance of an adult-
44 use cannabis establishment license for an independent cannabis consumption
45 lounge. Section 8 of this bill removes provisions requiring the Board to set forth
46 certain restrictions on the transfer of an adult-use cannabis establishment license for
47 an independent cannabis consumption lounge.
48 Existing law requires the Board to adopt certain regulations to carry out the
49 provisions of existing law governing the licensing and control of cannabis. (NRS
50 678B.650) Section 10 of this bill prohibits those regulations from requiring: (1) a
51 cannabis sales facility to maintain a visitor’s log; and (2) a cannabis establishment
52 to maintain records concerning sales transactions for more than 3 years. Section 10
53 additionally requires those regulations to allow certain agents of a cannabis
54 establishment to conduct a quarterly inventory, if such a quarterly inventory is
55 required by the Board. Sections 13-15 of this bill make conforming changes to
56 refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 10.
57 Section 11 of this bill revises the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the
58 seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis.
59 Existing law authorizes a cannabis sales facility to contract with a third party or
60 intermediary business to deliver cannabis or cannabis products. (NRS 678C.440,
61 678D.430) Section 4 of this bill authorizes a cannabis sales facility or a third party
62 or intermediary business with whom the cannabis sales facility has contracted to
-
*AB203_R1*

– 3 –
63 deliver cannabis or cannabis products to a consumer at any location so long as the
64 location is not on the property of a school, community facility or airport or, with
65 certain exceptions, within a certain distance from a gaming establishment. Section
66 4 additionally prohibits the Board from requiring a vehicle used for such deliveries
67 to be inspected by the Board before making such a delivery.
68 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to destroy marijuana that has
69 been seized from a defendant without prior court approval under certain
70 circumstances. (NRS 52.400) Section 18 of this bill specifies that the Board
71 constitutes a law enforcement agency for the purposes of that authorization.
72 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross
73 receipts of the retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State.
74 (NRS 372.105, 374.110, 374.111) Sections 19 and 25 of this bill clarify that the
75 provisions of existing law governing the imposition, collection and remittance of
76 the sales taxes apply to a retailer who makes a retail sale of cannabis or cannabis
77 products regardless of whether the retailer holds a license issued by the Board.
78 Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to impose upon
79 any person who does not hold a license issued by the Board and who sells cannabis
80 or a cannabis product an administrative fine in the amount of the excise tax on
81 cannabis for which the person would have been liable had the person engaged in
82 the sale as an adult-use cannabis cultivation facility or adult-use cannabis retail
83 store. Sections 21, 22 and 24 of this bill make conforming changes to provide that
84 the definitions in existing law apply to section 20 and to clarify that certain
85 provisions of existing law apply to section 20.
86 Existing law sets forth the primary functions and responsibilities of the
87 Investigation Division of the Department of Public Safety. (NRS 480.140) Section
88 26 of this bill additionally authorizes the Division to collaborate with the Board and
89 other state and local agencies for the enforcement of criminal laws relating to
90 unlicensed cannabis activities.
91 Section 28 of this bill requires the Board and the Nevada Gaming Control
92 Board, on or before December 31, 2026, to jointly prepare and submit a report
93 concerning the relationship between the gaming industry and the cannabis industry
94 in this State to the Governor and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
