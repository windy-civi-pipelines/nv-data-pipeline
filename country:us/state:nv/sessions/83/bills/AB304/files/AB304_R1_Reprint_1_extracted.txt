properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 To the extent money is available, and with the use of existing personnel and
2 resources, this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to create
3 a pilot program to collect and analyze data that is publicly available or voluntarily
4 provided to the pilot program related to best practices for, and the outcome of
5 studies concerning, transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromagnetic brain
6 pulse treatment. This bill requires the Department to compile a report of the
7 findings and recommendations of the pilot program, which must be posted on an
8 Internet website maintained by the Department and submitted to the Director of the
9 Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. 1. The Department of Health and Human Services
2 shall, to the extent money is available, create a pilot program to
3 collect and analyze data that is publicly available or voluntarily
4 provided to the pilot program concerning:
5 (a) The best practices for transcranial magnetic stimulation and
6 electromagnetic brain pulse treatment; and
7 (b) The results of studies concerning transcranial magnetic
8 stimulation and electromagnetic brain pulse treatment.
9 2. The data described in subsection 1 may be collected from:
10 (a) Entities that provide transcranial magnetic stimulation or
11 electromagnetic brain pulse treatment in this State; and
12 (b) Public or private research institutions that conduct studies on
13 transcranial magnetic stimulation or electromagnetic brain pulse
14 treatment for persons with a substance use disorder, post-traumatic
15 stress disorder or an addictive disorder related to gambling.
16 3. The Department shall use existing personnel, resources and
17 technology to administer the pilot program.
18 4. The Department shall, on or before July 1, 2027, compile a
19 report of its findings and recommendations resulting from the pilot
20 program, which must be:
21 (a) Posted on an Internet website maintained by the Department;

26 5. The Department may apply for and accept gifts, grants and
27 donations to assist with the implementation of the pilot program.
28 6. As used in this section:
29 (a) “Electromagnetic brain pulse treatment” means a
30 noninvasive and non-pharmaceutical treatment that uses an
31 electroencephalograph and transcranial magnetic stimulation to
32 image and identify abnormal brainwaves and provide treatment
33 through the delivery of pulse-matching, electromagnetic stimulation
34 intended to restore normal brain function.
35 (b) “Transcranial magnetic stimulation” means a noninvasive
36 procedure that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate and alter brain
37 activity.
38 Sec. 2. This act becomes effective on October 1, 2025, and
39 expires by limitation on September 30, 2027.
