Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [To the extent money is available, and with the use of existing personnel and resources,
2 this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to create a pilot program to
3 collect and analyze data that is publicly available or voluntarily provided to the pilot program
4 related to best practices for, and the outcome of studies concerning,] This bill requires a
5 practitioner or entity that conducts a pilot program that researches transcranial magnetic
6 stimulation [and] or electromagnetic brain pulse treatment [. This bill requires the Department
7 to compile a report of the findings and recommendations of the pilot program, which must be
8 posted on an Internet website maintained by the Department and submitted] to submit certain
9 notifications and reports to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau . [for transmittal
10 to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.] Specifically, this
11 bill requires the practitioner or entity, before commencing the pilot program, to submit
12 to the Director a notification that contains certain information relating to the
13 practitioner or entity, the methodology of the research and the research subjects.
14 Additionally, once the pilot program commences, this bill requires the practitioner or
15 entity to submit a report once each calendar quarter to the Director which contains
16 certain information related to the research subjects. Finally, upon the completion of the
17 pilot program, this bill requires the practitioner or entity to submit a final report to the
18 Director that contains certain information related to the results of the pilot program and
19 any corresponding recommendations related to the research.
