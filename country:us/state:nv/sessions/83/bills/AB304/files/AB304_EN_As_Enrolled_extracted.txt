Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
This bill requires a practitioner or entity that conducts a pilot program that
researches transcranial magnetic stimulation or electromagnetic brain pulse
treatment to submit certain notifications and reports to the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau. Specifically, this bill requires the practitioner or entity,
before commencing the pilot program, to submit to the Director a notification that
contains certain information relating to the practitioner or entity, the methodology
of the research and the research subjects. Additionally, once the pilot program
commences, this bill requires the practitioner or entity to submit a report once each
calendar quarter to the Director which contains certain information related to the
research subjects. Finally, upon the completion of the pilot program, this bill
requires the practitioner or entity to submit a final report to the Director that
contains certain information related to the results of the pilot program and any
corresponding recommendations related to the research.

(3) The number of research subjects anticipated to be
involved in the pilot program and a general description of the

(5) An identification of any licenses, registrations and other
approvals that are necessary to conduct the research under the pilot
program and proof that the practitioner or entity has obtained all
such licenses, registrations and approvals;
(b) At least once each calendar quarter while research is being
conducted under the pilot program, a report concerning the research,
which must include, without limitation:

program in the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
(2) Aggregated demographic information concerning the
research subjects;
(3) Baseline health and mental health assessments of the

(4) Outcomes of treatment, including, without limitation,
longitudinal data after the conclusion of treatments; and
(5) Data relating to any monitoring that is performed for
ethical or safety purposes; and
(c) After the pilot program has concluded, a report on the results
of the research conducted under the pilot program and any
corresponding recommendations relating to the research.

2. If multiple practitioners or entities conduct research under
the same pilot program, the practitioners or entities may submit a
single report pursuant to subsection 1 concerning the pilot program.

Section 4:
3. A notification or report submitted pursuant to subsection 1

provision of transcranial magnetic stimulation or electromagnetic
brain pulse treatment, or both, to subjects in this State.
(c) “Transcranial magnetic stimulation” means a noninvasive
procedure that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate specific areas of
the brain to alter brain activity.
Sec. 2. This act becomes effective on October 1, 2025, and
