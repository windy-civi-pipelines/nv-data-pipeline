EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; establishing certain notification
and reporting requirements concerning pilot programs that
research transcranial magnetic stimulation or
electromagnetic brain pulse treatment; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill requires a practitioner or entity that conducts a pilot program that
2 researches transcranial magnetic stimulation or electromagnetic brain pulse
3 treatment to submit certain notifications and reports to the Director of the
4 Legislative Counsel Bureau. Specifically, this bill requires the practitioner or entity,
5 before commencing the pilot program, to submit to the Director a notification that
6 contains certain information relating to the practitioner or entity, the methodology
7 of the research and the research subjects. Additionally, once the pilot program
8 commences, this bill requires the practitioner or entity to submit a report once each
9 calendar quarter to the Director which contains certain information related to the
10 research subjects. Finally, upon the completion of the pilot program, this bill

7 notification that contains:
8 (1) The name of the practitioner or entity conducting the
9 research under the pilot program;
10 (2) A description of the purpose, scope and objectives of the
11 research to be conducted under the pilot program, which must
12 include, without limitation, an identification of whether transcranial
13 magnetic stimulation or electromagnetic brain pulse treatment, or
14 both, will be used in the pilot program;
15 (3) The number of research subjects anticipated to be
16 involved in the pilot program and a general description of the
17 characteristics of each research subject;
18 (4) Any location at which the research will be conducted
19 under the pilot program; and
20 (5) An identification of any licenses, registrations and other
21 approvals that are necessary to conduct the research under the pilot
22 program and proof that the practitioner or entity has obtained all
23 such licenses, registrations and approvals;
24 (b) At least once each calendar quarter while research is being
25 conducted under the pilot program, a report concerning the research,
26 which must include, without limitation:
27 (1) The number of research subjects participating in the pilot
28 program in the immediately preceding calendar quarter;
29 (2) Aggregated demographic information concerning the
30 research subjects;
31 (3) Baseline health and mental health assessments of the
32 research subjects;
33 (4) Outcomes of treatment, including, without limitation,
34 longitudinal data after the conclusion of treatments; and
35 (5) Data relating to any monitoring that is performed for
36 ethical or safety purposes; and
37 (c) After the pilot program has concluded, a report on the results
38 of the research conducted under the pilot program and any
39 corresponding recommendations relating to the research.
40 2. If multiple practitioners or entities conduct research under
41 the same pilot program, the practitioners or entities may submit a
42 single report pursuant to subsection 1 concerning the pilot program.

1 3. A notification or report submitted pursuant to subsection 1
2 must not contain any information that would lead to the
3 identification of any research subject participating in the pilot
4 program.
5 4. A practitioner or entity shall not implement a pilot program
6 unless the practitioner or entity complies with the provisions of this
7 section.
8 5. Nothing in the provisions of this section:

19 collaborating, from accepting gifts, grants, donations and other
20 resources of money to support the pilot program.
21 6. As used in this section:
22 (a) “Electromagnetic brain pulse treatment” means a
23 noninvasive and non-pharmaceutical treatment that uses
24 electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation to
25 identify abnormal patterns in brainwaves and provide therapeutic
26 electromagnetic stimulation to normalize brain activity.
27 (b) “Pilot program” means a research project that involves the
28 provision of transcranial magnetic stimulation or electromagnetic
29 brain pulse treatment, or both, to subjects in this State.
30 (c) “Transcranial magnetic stimulation” means a noninvasive
31 procedure that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate specific areas of
32 the brain to alter brain activity.
33 Sec. 2. This act becomes effective on October 1, 2025, and
34 expires by limitation on September 30, 2027.
