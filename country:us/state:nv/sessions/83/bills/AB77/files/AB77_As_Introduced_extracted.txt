~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising criteria governing the
approval of an application for certain partial abatements
of taxes; authorizing the Office of Economic
Development to deny an application for certain partial
abatements of taxes if the Office determines that the
denial of an application is in the best interests of the State;
authorizing businesses that recycle certain materials or
produce certain fuels from recycled materials to apply to
the Office for a partial abatement of certain taxes on real
property; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who intends to locate or expand a business in
2 this State to apply to the Office of Economic Development for a partial abatement
3 of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes. The Office is
4 required to approve an application for such a partial abatement if the Office
5 determines that the business applying for the partial abatement satisfies certain
6 criteria. (NRS 360.750) Section 2 of this bill revises one of the eligibility criteria
7 by requiring a business that is anticipated to have at least 500 full-time employees
8 on the payroll of the business within a certain period, rather than 50 such
9 employees, to comply with the requirement to have a policy for paid family and
10 medical leave for employees. Section 2 also removes a prohibition on the approval
11 of a partial abatement for an applicant who intends to expand a business and who
12 has already received a partial abatement for expanding that business, thereby
-

– 2 –
13 authorizing a business to obtain a partial abatement for multiple expansions of a
14 business. (NRS 360.750)
15 Another eligibility criteria for a business to qualify for a partial abatement is
16 that the business offers primary jobs, which are jobs at a business location in this
17 State where at least half of the revenue generated at that business location is
18 derived from exports to locations outside of this State. (NRS 360.750; NAC
19 231.363) Section 2 revises this determination by authorizing the approval of a
20 partial abatement for a business that: (1) offers import substitution jobs, which are
21 generally defined as jobs at a business location in this State where certain goods or
22 services are manufactured, produced or sold in this State and reduce the amount of
23 such goods or services imported into this State from outside this State; or (2) is a
24 provider of specialty health care or a provider of health care in a rural area, except
25 that the amount of the partial abatement is greater for such providers who are
26 providers of services under Medicaid. Sections 1, 5 and 6 of this bill similarly
27 expand the eligibility criteria for certain partial abatements of taxes to authorize a
28 business to obtain such a partial abatement by offering import substitution jobs.
29 Sections 7, 8 and 9 of this bill revise reporting requirements relating to businesses
30 awarded partial abatements of taxes to include, in addition to information on
31 primary jobs, information on the number of import substitution jobs, jobs with a
32 provider of specialty health care and jobs with a provider of health care in a rural
33 area. Section 10 of this bill expands eligibility for certain grants from the Office for
34 workforce training programs to include programs providing training for import
35 substitution jobs and jobs in specialty health care or health care in a rural area.
36 Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this bill authorize the Office to deny an application for a
37 partial abatement for a new or expanding business if the Office determines that
38 denying the application is in the best interests of the State.
39 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
40 imposed on real property for a business that: (1) either engages in the primary trade
41 of preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
42 intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled material or includes as
43 a primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled
44 material; and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the
45 substitution of other sources of energy for fossil sources of energy. (NRS
46 701A.210) Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Office to grant such a partial
47 abatement of property taxes to a business that: (1) includes as a primary component
48 a facility for the production of biofuels, biomass or other primary fuels from
49 recycled material for use in the production of energy; or (2) primarily engages in
50 the recycling or repurposing of materials that were used to produce or store
51 renewable energy, including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels, or
52 waste materials resulting from the extraction of minerals.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 77–COMMITTEE ON REVENUE
(ON BEHALF OF THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing tax abatements for
certain businesses. (BDR 32-282)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising criteria governing the
approval of an application for certain partial abatements
of taxes; authorizing the Office of Economic
Development to deny an application for certain partial
abatements of taxes if the Office determines that the
denial of an application is in the best interests of the State;
authorizing businesses that recycle certain materials or
produce certain fuels from recycled materials to apply to
the Office for a partial abatement of certain taxes on real
property; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who intends to locate or expand a business in
2 this State to apply to the Office of Economic Development for a partial abatement
3 of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes. The Office is
4 required to approve an application for such a partial abatement if the Office
5 determines that the business applying for the partial abatement satisfies certain
6 criteria. (NRS 360.750) Section 2 of this bill revises one of the eligibility criteria
7 by requiring a business that is anticipated to have at least 500 full-time employees
8 on the payroll of the business within a certain period, rather than 50 such
9 employees, to comply with the requirement to have a policy for paid family and
10 medical leave for employees. Section 2 also removes a prohibition on the approval
11 of a partial abatement for an applicant who intends to expand a business and who
12 has already received a partial abatement for expanding that business, thereby
-

– 2 –
13 authorizing a business to obtain a partial abatement for multiple expansions of a
14 business. (NRS 360.750)
15 Another eligibility criteria for a business to qualify for a partial abatement is
16 that the business offers primary jobs, which are jobs at a business location in this
17 State where at least half of the revenue generated at that business location is
18 derived from exports to locations outside of this State. (NRS 360.750; NAC
19 231.363) Section 2 revises this determination by authorizing the approval of a
20 partial abatement for a business that: (1) offers import substitution jobs, which are
21 generally defined as jobs at a business location in this State where certain goods or
22 services are manufactured, produced or sold in this State and reduce the amount of
23 such goods or services imported into this State from outside this State; or (2) is a
24 provider of specialty health care or a provider of health care in a rural area, except
25 that the amount of the partial abatement is greater for such providers who are
26 providers of services under Medicaid. Sections 1, 5 and 6 of this bill similarly
27 expand the eligibility criteria for certain partial abatements of taxes to authorize a
28 business to obtain such a partial abatement by offering import substitution jobs.
29 Sections 7, 8 and 9 of this bill revise reporting requirements relating to businesses
30 awarded partial abatements of taxes to include, in addition to information on
31 primary jobs, information on the number of import substitution jobs, jobs with a
32 provider of specialty health care and jobs with a provider of health care in a rural
33 area. Section 10 of this bill expands eligibility for certain grants from the Office for
34 workforce training programs to include programs providing training for import
35 substitution jobs and jobs in specialty health care or health care in a rural area.
36 Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this bill authorize the Office to deny an application for a
37 partial abatement for a new or expanding business if the Office determines that
38 denying the application is in the best interests of the State.
39 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
40 imposed on real property for a business that: (1) either engages in the primary trade
41 of preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
42 intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled material or includes as
43 a primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled
44 material; and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the
45 substitution of other sources of energy for fossil sources of energy. (NRS
46 701A.210) Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Office to grant such a partial
47 abatement of property taxes to a business that: (1) includes as a primary component
48 a facility for the production of biofuels, biomass or other primary fuels from
49 recycled material for use in the production of energy; or (2) primarily engages in
50 the recycling or repurposing of materials that were used to produce or store
51 renewable energy, including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels, or
52 waste materials resulting from the extraction of minerals.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
