SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Trust Fund for
Child Welfare. (BDR 38-1124)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; revising provisions relating to
deductions from the separate account of a child in the
Trust Fund for Child Welfare; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) creates the Trust Fund for Child Welfare; and (2) provides
2 that all benefits for survivors or other awards payable to children receiving child
3 welfare services in a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all
4 counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) must be deposited in the State
5 Treasury for credit to the Fund. Under existing law, the Division of Child and
6 Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to:
7 (1) keep a separate account for each child who receives money from the Fund; and
8 (2) deduct from a child’s separate account any services to the child provided by
9 public money. Existing law also provides that: (1) any surplus remaining after such
10 deductions may be expended for extraordinary items deemed beneficial to the child;
11 and (2) any surplus balance must be remitted to the parent or legal guardian of the
12 child, or to the child if the child is emancipated or has reached the age of 18 years,
13 when the Division is no longer legally responsible for the child. (NRS 432.037)
14 This bill eliminates the requirement for the Division to deduct from a child’s
15 separate account in the Fund any services to the child provided by public money.

34 services for any child welfare services provided to the child with
35 public money.
36 5. As used in this section, “interest period” means that period
