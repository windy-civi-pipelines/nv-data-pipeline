Assembly Bill No. 552–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to child welfare; revising provisions relating to
deductions from the separate account of a child in the Trust
Fund for Child Welfare; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) creates the Trust Fund for Child Welfare; and (2) provides
that all benefits for survivors or other awards payable to children receiving child
welfare services in a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all
counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) must be deposited in the State
Treasury for credit to the Fund. Under existing law, the Division of Child and
Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to:
(1) keep a separate account for each child who receives money from the Fund; and
(2) deduct from a child’s separate account any services to the child provided by
public money. Existing law also provides that: (1) any surplus remaining after such
deductions may be expended for extraordinary items deemed beneficial to the child;
and (2) any surplus balance must be remitted to the parent or legal guardian of the
child, or to the child if the child is emancipated or has reached the age of 18 years,
when the Division is no longer legally responsible for the child. (NRS 432.037)
This bill eliminates the requirement for the Division to deduct from a child’s
separate account in the Fund any services to the child provided by public money.

3. The Division shall pay interest to each child’s separate
account maintained in the Trust Fund for Child Welfare at the end
of each interest period. Interest must be paid at a rate equal to the
average of the interest rates quoted by at least three banking
institutions for interest-bearing savings accounts of $3,000 or less
on the first day of each interest period. Interest must be paid on the
child’s account commencing with the first interest period that the
Division is legally responsible for the child. Interest must not be
paid for the interest period during which the child ceases to be the
legal responsibility of the Division.
4. All benefits for survivors or other awards payable to
children receiving child welfare services in a county whose
population is 100,000 or more pursuant to NRS 432.010 to 432.085,
inclusive, must be deposited in the trust fund for child welfare
established in the county treasury. A disbursement from the benefits
for survivors or other awards of a child which is deposited in the
fund may be made to the agency which provides child welfare
services for any child welfare services provided to the child with
public money.
5. As used in this section, “interest period” means that period
not less frequent than quarterly, as determined by the State
Treasurer, for which interest must be paid.
