Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this
2 State and requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality
3 to incur certain debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an
4 installment-purchase agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law
5 also requires a commission to review and vote on proposals by general
6 improvement districts to issue medium-term obligations, borrow money or issue
7 certain securities, among certain other duties and responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115,
8 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management commission to meet annually in
9 August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in addition to certain other
10 meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
11 annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make conforming
12 changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.

13 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders
14 and county auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep
15 open the county office and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and
16 nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and on all days except Sundays,
17 nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Existing law also authorizes
18 the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or authorize
19 deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
20 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that
21 the county treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of
22 this bill provides that the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county
23 treasurer may not close earlier than 5 p.m. but may close later than 5 p.m.
24 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent
25 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information
26 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
27 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
28 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of
29 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
30 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
31 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
32 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
33 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
34 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
35 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
36 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
37 by law for the redemption of a property described in a certificate has expired and no
38 redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required to
39 execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon obtaining
40 such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust until it is
41 sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods or
42 not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
43 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the
44 receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
45 (NRS 361.585) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or
46 not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
47 before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have
48 the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the
49 delinquent taxes and certain costs.
50 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
51 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
52 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
53 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
54 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
55 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
56 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
57 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under
58 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
59 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
60 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
61 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
62 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this
63 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
64 the Clark County School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to
65 oversee one or more local school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law
66 prescribes the duties of a school associate superintendent, including requiring a
67 school associate superintendent to provide a report in person, not less than
-
*SB15_R1*

– 3 –
68 quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a local
69 school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS
70 388G.630) Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
71 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to
72 construct, install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and
73 power lines, gas and water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things.
74 (NRS 709.050) Any person or entity desiring a franchise is required to file an
75 application in writing with the board of county commissioners wherein the
76 franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an application is
77 required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to be:
78 (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
79 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in
80 three public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than
81 one unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the
82 unincorporated towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such
83 requirements to post the notice from three places to one place if more than one
84 unincorporated town is affected by reducing the postings required in public places
85 in each of the unincorporated towns.

2 required pursuant to this section if the board of county
3 commissioners approves the plan for the deviation submitted by the

5 laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
6 cost savings.
7 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not
8 designate or approve the county office or branch office, if any, of
9 the county treasurer to close earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction

25 number of days of the month in which the absence occurs. The
26 money must be withheld from payment of salary to the officer for
27 the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
28 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first
29 giving the officer affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to
30 appear before the board and defend the charge against him or her.

30 period of redemption has expired, the tax receiver shall maintain

32 may prescribe in support of the affidavit.

41 than 45 days before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as

1 must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or
2 other person or governmental entity before the sale.
3 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
4 treasurer shall make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon
5 payment to the county treasurer, as trustee, of a consideration not
6 less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim deed, discharged of
7 any trust of the property mentioned in the order.
8 6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county
9 treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the day
10 of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the
11 county treasurer with an affidavit signed by the treasurer of the
12 municipality stating that:
13 (a) The municipality sold the property or the property was
14 stricken off to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
15 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the
16 purchaser pursuant to NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant
17 to NRS 271.560,
18  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described
19 in subsection 5 unless the person who purchased the property from
20 the county pays to the municipality any amount owed pursuant to
21 the certificate of sale issued pursuant to NRS 271.560 and 271.570
22 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the treasurer of
23 the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
24 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within
25 20 days after the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the
26 property by the county is void and the county treasurer may retain
27 for administrative costs not more than 10 percent of the purchase
28 amount paid by the purchaser.
29 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record
30 the deed at the expense of the purchaser.

32 before, on or after July 1, 1955, are primary evidence:
33 (a) Of the regularity of all proceedings relating to the order of
34 the board of county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of
35 the property;
36 (b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has
37 elected to use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property,
38 the property is abandoned; and
39 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal
40 property, the real property belonged to the person liable to pay the
41 tax.
42 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county
43 treasurer until he or she files at the expense of the purchaser, with
44 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
45 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,

– 12 –
1 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
2 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
3 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
4 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
5 office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
6 thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
7 and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
8 thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
9 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
10 with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each
11 purchaser, together with the date of sale, a description of the
12 property sold, a reference to the book and page of the minutes of the
