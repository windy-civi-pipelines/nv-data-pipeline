Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this State and
2 requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality to incur certain
3 debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an installment-purchase
4 agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law also requires a commission to
5 review and vote on proposals by general improvement districts to issue medium-term
6 obligations, borrow money or issue certain securities, among certain other duties and
7 responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115, 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management
8 commission to meet annually in August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in
9 addition to certain other meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the
10 requirement that the annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make
11 conforming changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
12 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders and county
13 auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep open the county office
14 and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12
15 p.m., and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
16 Existing law also authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or
17 authorize deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
18 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that the county
19 treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of this bill provides that
Assembly Amendment No. 568 to Senate Bill No. 15 First Reprint Page 4
20 the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county treasurer may not close earlier than
21 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later than 5 p.m.
22 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent taxes to
23 certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information including that if the
24 amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at 5 p.m. on the first Monday in
25 June of the current year, issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the
26 property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency
27 must state that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close
28 of business of the tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year,
29 issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
30 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that describes
31 each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs have not been paid. The
32 trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold each property for a certain period
33 of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed by law for the redemption of a property
34 described in a certificate has expired and no redemption has been made, the tax receiver who
35 issued the certificate is required to execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the
36 property. Upon obtaining such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in
37 trust until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods
38 or not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
39 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
40 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs. (NRS 361.585) Section
41 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or not later than the close of business
42 of the county treasurer on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
43 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
44 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
45 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to sell property
46 held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county treasurer is required, with
47 certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the purchaser. Existing law provides an
48 exception to this requirement to issue a quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not
49 later than 5 p.m. on the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the
50 county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets
51 certain requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under certain
52 circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not later than the
53 close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the
54 day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an
55 affidavit that meets certain requirements.
56 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this State which
57 has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
58 School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to oversee one or more local
59 school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law prescribes the duties of a school associate
60 superintendent, including requiring a school associate superintendent to provide a report in
61 person, not less than quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a
62 local school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS 388G.630)
63 Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
64 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to construct,
65 install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and power lines, gas and
66 water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things. (NRS 709.050) Any person or
67 entity desiring a franchise is required to file an application in writing with the board of county
68 commissioners wherein the franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an
69 application is required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to
70 be: (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
71 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in three
72 public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than one
73 unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the unincorporated
74 towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such requirements to post the notice from
75 three places to one place if more than one unincorporated town is affected by reducing the
76 postings required in public places in each of the unincorporated towns.

11 and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5
12 p.m. for the transaction of public business, but nothing contained in this subsection
13 interferes with a duty now required of a public officer under the election laws of
14 this State. County clerks shall keep their offices open on all election days during the
15 hours when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the district
16 judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes except election business and

22 proceedings, designate the days and hours during which the offices of the sheriff,
23 county recorder and county auditor, county clerk, county assessor and county
24 treasurer must be kept open for the transaction of public business. An order so
25 made and entered must require each office to be kept open for not less than 40
26 hours during each week, and must not prevent the county clerk from closing his or
27 her office for all purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage
28 licenses on primary and general election days as provided in subsection 1.
29 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county officer to rent,

31 branch office may be kept open for the transaction of public business on the days
32 and during the hours specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during
33 such hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection do not
34 preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain duties to be performed
35 at the county seat.
36 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation required
37 pursuant to this section if the board of county commissioners approves the plan for
38 the deviation submitted by the office, except that no such deviation may conflict
39 with the election laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
40 cost savings.
41 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not designate or
42 approve the county office or branch office, if any, of the county treasurer to close
43 earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction of business on [all days except Sundays,
44 nonjudicial days and Saturdays.] any business day. Nothing in this subsection
45 shall be construed to prohibit the offices from closing later than 5 p.m.
46 6. A county officer who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a
47 misdemeanor, and if an officer mentioned in subsection 1 absents himself or herself
48 from office, except:

50 (b) When expressly permitted so to do by the board of county commissioners
51 or a majority of the members thereof in writing; or
Assembly Amendment No. 568 to Senate Bill No. 15 First Reprint Page 8
1 (c) When he or she makes provision to leave his or her office open for the
2 transaction of public business on the days and during the hours prescribed by this
3 section and in charge of a deputy qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,
4  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary that proportion
5 thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the number of days of the month
6 in which the absence occurs. The money must be withheld from payment of salary
7 to the officer for the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
8 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first giving the officer
9 affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to appear before the board and defend
10 the charge against him or her.
11 Sec. 4. NRS 361.5648 is hereby amended to read as follows:

14 county shall mail notice of the delinquency by first-class mail to:

31 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue to
32 the county treasurer, as trustee for the State and county, a certificate authorizing the
33 county treasurer to hold the property, subject to redemption within 2 years, or
34 within 1 year if the property is determined to be abandoned pursuant to NRS
35 361.567, after the date of the issuance of the certificate, by payment of the taxes
36 and accruing taxes, penalties and costs, together with interest on the taxes at the rate
37 of 10 percent per annum, assessed monthly, from the date due until paid as
38 provided by law, except as otherwise provided in NRS 360.232 and 360.320, and
39 that redemption may be made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 21 of
40 NRS in regard to real property sold under execution.
41 3. Within 30 days after mailing the original notice of delinquency, the tax
42 receiver shall issue his or her personal affidavit to the board of county
43 commissioners affirming that due notice has been mailed with respect to each
44 parcel. The affidavit must recite the number of letters mailed, the number of letters
45 returned and the number of letters finally determined to be undeliverable. Until the
46 period of redemption has expired, the tax receiver shall maintain detailed records
47 which contain such information as the Department may prescribe in support of the
48 affidavit.
49 4. A second copy of the notice of delinquency must be sent by certified mail,
50 not less than 60 days before the expiration of the period of redemption as stated in
51 the notice.
52 5. The cost of each mailing must be charged to the delinquent taxpayer.

5 authorized to provide title insurance in this State.
6 Sec. 5. NRS 361.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:

8 described in a certificate has expired and no redemption has been made, the tax

18 sale and be:
19 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including one at the
20 courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days before the day of sale or,
21 in lieu of such a posting, by publication of the notice at least once a week for 4
22 consecutive weeks by four weekly insertions in some newspaper published within
23 the county, the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale, if
24 the board of county commissioners so directs.
25 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 45 days
26 before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as shown on the tax roll and to
27 any person or governmental entity that appears in the records of the county to have
28 a lien or other interest in the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county
29 treasurer must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or other
30 person or governmental entity before the sale.
31 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county treasurer shall
32 make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon payment to the county treasurer,
33 as trustee, of a consideration not less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim
34 deed, discharged of any trust of the property mentioned in the order.
35 6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county treasurer on
36 the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county
37 treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit signed by
38 the treasurer of the municipality stating that:
39 (a) The municipality sold the property or the property was stricken off to the
40 municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
41 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the purchaser pursuant to
42 NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560,
43  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described in subsection 5
44 unless the person who purchased the property from the county pays to the
45 municipality any amount owed pursuant to the certificate of sale issued pursuant to
46 NRS 271.560 and 271.570 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the
47 treasurer of the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
48 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within 20 days after
49 the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the property by the county is void
50 and the county treasurer may retain for administrative costs not more than 10
51 percent of the purchase amount paid by the purchaser.
52 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record the deed at the
53 expense of the purchaser.
Assembly Amendment No. 568 to Senate Bill No. 15 First Reprint Page 11
1 8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued before, on or after
2 July 1, 1955, are primary evidence:
3 (a) Of the regularity of all proceedings relating to the order of the board of
4 county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of the property;
5 (b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to use an
6 expedited procedure for the sale of the property, the property is abandoned; and
7 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal property, the
8 real property belonged to the person liable to pay the tax.
9 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county treasurer until he or
10 she files at the expense of the purchaser, with the clerk of the board of county
11 commissioners, proper affidavits of posting and of publication of the notice of sale,
12 as the case may be, together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing
13 compliance with the order of the board of county commissioners, which constitutes
14 primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
15 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the office of the
16 county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating thereto, is void as against
17 any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration of the same
18 property, or any portion thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
19 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk with a record
20 book in which must be indexed the name of each purchaser, together with the date
21 of sale, a description of the property sold, a reference to the book and page of the
22 minutes of the board of county commissioners where the order of sale is recorded,
23 and the file number of the affidavits and return.

36 Community Education Advisory Board; and
37 (e) Carry out any other duties assigned by the superintendent at his or her
38 discretion or after approval by the superintendent of a request made by the local
39 school precinct.
40 2. The school associate superintendent must be held accountable for all

44 (a) The satisfaction of the parents and legal guardians of pupils and the
45 teachers, administrators and other staff of the local school precinct as determined
46 by the surveys administered pursuant to NRS 388G.800; and
47 (b) The progress made by the local school precinct to satisfy the goals and

(ON BEHALF OF CLARK COUNTY)
PREFILED OCTOBER 31, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to governmental administration.
(BDR 30-464)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising provisions relating to
the timing of when an annual meeting of a debt management
commission must occur; revising the hours the office of the county
treasurer is required to be kept open; revising the contents of a notice
of delinquent taxes; revising provisions relating to certain property
held in trust by the county treasurer; eliminating the requirement that a
school associate superintendent provide a quarterly report to the
governing body of a county within a local school precinct; revising the
notice requirements relating to applications for certain franchises; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this State and
2 requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality to incur certain
3 debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an installment-purchase
4 agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law also requires a commission to
5 review and vote on proposals by general improvement districts to issue medium-term
6 obligations, borrow money or issue certain securities, among certain other duties and
7 responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115, 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management
8 commission to meet annually in August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in
9 addition to certain other meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the
10 requirement that the annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make
11 conforming changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
12 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders and county
13 auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep open the county office
14 and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12
15 p.m., and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
16 Existing law also authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or
17 authorize deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
18 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that the county
19 treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of this bill provides that

Assembly Amendment No. 568 to Senate Bill No. 15 First Reprint Page 4
20 the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county treasurer may not close earlier than
21 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later than 5 p.m.
22 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent taxes to
23 certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information including that if the
24 amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at 5 p.m. on the first Monday in
25 June of the current year, issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the
26 property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency
27 must state that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close
28 of business of the tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year,
29 issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
30 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that describes
31 each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs have not been paid. The
32 trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold each property for a certain period
33 of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed by law for the redemption of a property
34 described in a certificate has expired and no redemption has been made, the tax receiver who
35 issued the certificate is required to execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the
36 property. Upon obtaining such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in
37 trust until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods
38 or not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
39 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
40 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs. (NRS 361.585) Section
41 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or not later than the close of business
42 of the county treasurer on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
43 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
44 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
45 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to sell property
46 held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county treasurer is required, with
47 certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the purchaser. Existing law provides an
48 exception to this requirement to issue a quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not
49 later than 5 p.m. on the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the
50 county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets
51 certain requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under certain
52 circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not later than the
53 close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the
54 day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an
55 affidavit that meets certain requirements.
56 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this State which
57 has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
58 School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to oversee one or more local
59 school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law prescribes the duties of a school associate
60 superintendent, including requiring a school associate superintendent to provide a report in
61 person, not less than quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a
62 local school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS 388G.630)
63 Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
64 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to construct,
65 install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and power lines, gas and
66 water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things. (NRS 709.050) Any person or
67 entity desiring a franchise is required to file an application in writing with the board of county
68 commissioners wherein the franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an
69 application is required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to
70 be: (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
71 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in three
72 public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than one
73 unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the unincorporated
74 towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such requirements to post the notice from
75 three places to one place if more than one unincorporated town is affected by reducing the
76 postings required in public places in each of the unincorporated towns.

1 2. Establish priorities among essential and nonessential facilities and services
2 for the purposes of paragraph (d) of subsection 1 of NRS 350.015. Facilities and

4 facilities and services, and all other facilities and services must be considered
5 nonessential facilities and services.
6 Sec. 3.5. NRS 245.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 245.040 1. Sheriffs, county recorders and county auditors, county clerks,
8 county assessors and county treasurers shall keep an office at the county seat of
9 their county which, except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, must be
10 kept open on all days except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 m.,
11 and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5
12 p.m. for the transaction of public business, but nothing contained in this subsection
13 interferes with a duty now required of a public officer under the election laws of
14 this State. County clerks shall keep their offices open on all election days during the
15 hours when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the district
16 judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes except election business and
17 the issuance of marriage licenses on any day on which the primary or general
18 election is held.
19 2. [Notwithstanding] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5 and
20 notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1, the board of county commissioners
21 of any county may, by an order regularly made and entered in the records of its
22 proceedings, designate the days and hours during which the offices of the sheriff,
23 county recorder and county auditor, county clerk, county assessor and county
24 treasurer must be kept open for the transaction of public business. An order so
25 made and entered must require each office to be kept open for not less than 40
26 hours during each week, and must not prevent the county clerk from closing his or
27 her office for all purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage
28 licenses on primary and general election days as provided in subsection 1.
29 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county officer to rent,
30 equip and operate, at public expense, one or more branch offices in the county. The
31 branch office may be kept open for the transaction of public business on the days
32 and during the hours specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during
33 such hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection do not
34 preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain duties to be performed
35 at the county seat.
36 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation required
37 pursuant to this section if the board of county commissioners approves the plan for
38 the deviation submitted by the office, except that no such deviation may conflict
39 with the election laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
40 cost savings.
41 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not designate or
42 approve the county office or branch office, if any, of the county treasurer to close
43 earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction of business on [all days except Sundays,
44 nonjudicial days and Saturdays.] any business day. Nothing in this subsection
45 shall be construed to prohibit the offices from closing later than 5 p.m.
46 6. A county officer who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a
47 misdemeanor, and if an officer mentioned in subsection 1 absents himself or herself
48 from office, except:
49 (a) When called away from his or her office by official duties;
50 (b) When expressly permitted so to do by the board of county commissioners
51 or a majority of the members thereof in writing; or

Assembly Amendment No. 568 to Senate Bill No. 15 First Reprint Page 8
1 (c) When he or she makes provision to leave his or her office open for the
2 transaction of public business on the days and during the hours prescribed by this
3 section and in charge of a deputy qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,
4  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary that proportion
5 thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the number of days of the month
6 in which the absence occurs. The money must be withheld from payment of salary
7 to the officer for the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
8 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first giving the officer
9 affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to appear before the board and defend
10 the charge against him or her.
11 Sec. 4. NRS 361.5648 is hereby amended to read as follows:

32 the county treasurer, as trustee for the State and county, a certificate authorizing the
33 county treasurer to hold the property, subject to redemption within 2 years, or
34 within 1 year if the property is determined to be abandoned pursuant to NRS
35 361.567, after the date of the issuance of the certificate, by payment of the taxes
36 and accruing taxes, penalties and costs, together with interest on the taxes at the rate
37 of 10 percent per annum, assessed monthly, from the date due until paid as
38 provided by law, except as otherwise provided in NRS 360.232 and 360.320, and
39 that redemption may be made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 21 of

43 commissioners affirming that due notice has been mailed with respect to each
44 parcel. The affidavit must recite the number of letters mailed, the number of letters
45 returned and the number of letters finally determined to be undeliverable. Until the
46 period of redemption has expired, the tax receiver shall maintain detailed records
47 which contain such information as the Department may prescribe in support of the
48 affidavit.
49 4. A second copy of the notice of delinquency must be sent by certified mail,
50 not less than 60 days before the expiration of the period of redemption as stated in
51 the notice.
52 5. The cost of each mailing must be charged to the delinquent taxpayer.

Assembly Amendment No. 568 to Senate Bill No. 15 First Reprint Page 9

4 interest in the property, relies upon a preliminary title search from a company
5 authorized to provide title insurance in this State.
6 Sec. 5. NRS 361.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 361.585 1. When the time allowed by law for the redemption of a property
8 described in a certificate has expired and no redemption has been made, the tax

17 during the 90-day period specified in NRS 361.603, or not later than [5 p.m.] the
18 close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day before the day
19 of the sale by a county treasurer, as specified in the notice required by NRS
20 361.595, of any property held in trust by him or her by virtue of any deed made
21 pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, any person specified in subsection 4 is
22 entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of
23 payment by or on behalf of that person of an amount equal to the taxes accrued,
24 together with any costs, penalties and interest legally chargeable against the
25 property. A reconveyance may not be made after expiration of the 90-day period

5 in lieu of such a posting, by publication of the notice at least once a week for 4
6 consecutive weeks by four weekly insertions in some newspaper published within
7 the county, the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale, if
8 the board of county commissioners so directs.
9 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 90 days
10 before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as shown on the tax roll and to
11 any person or governmental entity that appears in the records of the county to have

13 treasurer must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or other
14 person or governmental entity before the sale.
15 4. If, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to use an

30 person or governmental entity before the sale.
31 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county treasurer shall

37 treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit signed by

6 expedited procedure for the sale of the property, the property is abandoned; and
7 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal property, the

10 she files at the expense of the purchaser, with the clerk of the board of county
11 commissioners, proper affidavits of posting and of publication of the notice of sale,
12 as the case may be, together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing
13 compliance with the order of the board of county commissioners, which constitutes
14 primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
15 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the office of the
16 county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating thereto, is void as against
17 any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration of the same
18 property, or any portion thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
