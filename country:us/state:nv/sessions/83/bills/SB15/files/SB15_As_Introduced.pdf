Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this
2 State and requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality
3 to incur certain debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an
4 installment-purchase agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law
5 also requires a commission to review and vote on proposals by general
6 improvement districts to issue medium-term obligations, borrow money or issue
7 certain securities, among certain other duties and responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115,
8 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management commission to meet annually in
9 August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in addition to certain other
10 meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
11 annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make conforming
12 changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
13 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent
14 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information
-
*SB15*

– 2 –
15 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
16 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
17 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of
18 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
19 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
20 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
21 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
22 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
23 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
24 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
25 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
26 by law for the redemption of a property described in a certificate has expired and no
27 redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required to
28 execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon obtaining
29 such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust until it is
30 sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods or
31 not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
32 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the
33 receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
34 (NRS 361.585) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or
35 not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
36 before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have
37 the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the
38 delinquent taxes and certain costs.
39 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
40 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
41 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
42 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
43 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
44 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
45 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
46 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under
47 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
48 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
49 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
50 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
51 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this
52 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
53 the Clark County School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to
54 oversee one or more local school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law
55 prescribes the duties of a school associate superintendent, including requiring a
56 school associate superintendent to provide a report in person, not less than
57 quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a local
58 school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS
59 388G.630) Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
60 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to
61 construct, install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and
62 power lines, gas and water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things.
63 (NRS 709.050) Any person or entity desiring a franchise is required to file an
64 application in writing with the board of county commissioners wherein the
65 franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an application is
66 required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to be:
67 (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
68 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in
69 three public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than
-

– 3 –
70 one unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the
71 unincorporated towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill eliminates such
72 requirements to post the notice unless no newspaper is published in the county.

22 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the

28 the certificate of sale issued pursuant to NRS 271.560 and 271.570

30 the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
31 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within

6 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
7 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
8 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
9 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
10 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
11 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
12 office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
13 thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
14 and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
15 thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
16 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
17 with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each

35 governing body of each city [and county] within which a local
36 school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located
37 and, if created pursuant to NRS 388G.760, to the Community
38 Education Advisory Board; and
39 (e) Carry out any other duties assigned by the superintendent at
40 his or her discretion or after approval by the superintendent of a
