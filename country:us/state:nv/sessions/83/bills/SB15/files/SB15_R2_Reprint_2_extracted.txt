Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this
2 State and requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality
3 to incur certain debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an
4 installment-purchase agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law
5 also requires a commission to review and vote on proposals by general
6 improvement districts to issue medium-term obligations, borrow money or issue
7 certain securities, among certain other duties and responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115,
8 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management commission to meet annually in
9 August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in addition to certain other
10 meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
11 annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make conforming
12 changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.

13 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders
14 and county auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep
15 open the county office and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and
16 nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and on all days except Sundays,
17 nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Existing law also authorizes
18 the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or authorize
19 deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
20 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that
21 the county treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of
22 this bill provides that the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county
23 treasurer may not close earlier than 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later
24 than 5 p.m.
25 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent
26 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information
27 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
28 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
29 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of
30 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
31 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
32 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
33 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
34 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
35 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
36 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
37 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
38 by law for the redemption of a property described in a certificate has expired and no
39 redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required to
40 execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon obtaining
41 such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust until it is
42 sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods or
43 not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
44 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the
45 receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
46 (NRS 361.585) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or
47 not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
48 before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have
49 the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the
50 delinquent taxes and certain costs.
51 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
52 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
53 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
54 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
55 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
56 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
57 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
58 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under
59 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
60 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
61 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
62 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
63 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this
64 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
65 the Clark County School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to
66 oversee one or more local school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law
67 prescribes the duties of a school associate superintendent, including requiring a
-
*SB15_R2*
– 3 –
68 school associate superintendent to provide a report in person, not less than
69 quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a local
70 school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS
71 388G.630) Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
72 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to
73 construct, install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and
74 power lines, gas and water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things.
75 (NRS 709.050) Any person or entity desiring a franchise is required to file an
76 application in writing with the board of county commissioners wherein the
77 franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an application is
78 required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to be:
79 (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
80 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in
81 three public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than
82 one unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the
83 unincorporated towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such
84 requirements to post the notice from three places to one place if more than one
85 unincorporated town is affected by reducing the postings required in public places
86 in each of the unincorporated towns.

2 required pursuant to this section if the board of county
3 commissioners approves the plan for the deviation submitted by the

5 laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
6 cost savings.
7 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not
8 designate or approve the county office or branch office, if any, of
9 the county treasurer to close earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction

24 number of days of the month in which the absence occurs. The
25 money must be withheld from payment of salary to the officer for
26 the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
27 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first
28 giving the officer affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to
29 appear before the board and defend the charge against him or her.
30 Sec. 4. NRS 361.5648 is hereby amended to read as follows:

24 been mailed with respect to each parcel. The affidavit must recite
25 the number of letters mailed, the number of letters returned and the
26 number of letters finally determined to be undeliverable. Until the
27 period of redemption has expired, the tax receiver shall maintain
28 detailed records which contain such information as the Department
29 may prescribe in support of the affidavit.

35 6. A county and its officers and employees are not liable for

40 provide title insurance in this State.
41 Sec. 5. NRS 361.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 361.585 1. When the time allowed by law for the redemption

30 the notice at least once a week for 4 consecutive weeks by four
31 weekly insertions in some newspaper published within the county,
32 the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale,
33 if the board of county commissioners so directs.
34 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less
35 than 45 days before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as
36 shown on the tax roll and to any person or governmental entity that
37 appears in the records of the county to have a lien or other interest in
38 the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county treasurer
39 must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or
40 other person or governmental entity before the sale.
41 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
42 treasurer shall make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon
43 payment to the county treasurer, as trustee, of a consideration not
44 less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim deed, discharged of
45 any trust of the property mentioned in the order.

1 6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county
2 treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the day
3 of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the
4 county treasurer with an affidavit signed by the treasurer of the
5 municipality stating that:
6 (a) The municipality sold the property or the property was
7 stricken off to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
8 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the
9 purchaser pursuant to NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant
10 to NRS 271.560,
11  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described
12 in subsection 5 unless the person who purchased the property from
13 the county pays to the municipality any amount owed pursuant to
14 the certificate of sale issued pursuant to NRS 271.560 and 271.570
15 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the treasurer of
16 the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
17 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within
18 20 days after the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the
19 property by the county is void and the county treasurer may retain
20 for administrative costs not more than 10 percent of the purchase
21 amount paid by the purchaser.
22 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record
23 the deed at the expense of the purchaser.
24 8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued
25 before, on or after July 1, 1955, are primary evidence:
26 (a) Of the regularity of all proceedings relating to the order of
27 the board of county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of
28 the property;
29 (b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has
30 elected to use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property,
31 the property is abandoned; and
32 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal
33 property, the real property belonged to the person liable to pay the
34 tax.
35 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county
36 treasurer until he or she files at the expense of the purchaser, with
37 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
38 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
39 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
40 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
41 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
42 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
43 office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
44 thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
-
*SB15_R2*
– 12 –
1 and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
2 thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
3 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
4 with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each
5 purchaser, together with the date of sale, a description of the
6 property sold, a reference to the book and page of the minutes of the
7 board of county commissioners where the order of sale is recorded,
8 and the file number of the affidavits and return.

25 Education Advisory Board; and
26 (e) Carry out any other duties assigned by the superintendent at
27 his or her discretion or after approval by the superintendent of a

11 the hearing, or must appear at the meeting and present their
12 objections at that time.
13 3. The notice must be published once each week for 4
14 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published

SECOND REPRINT S.B. 15
SENATE BILL NO. 15–COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF CLARK COUNTY)
PREFILED OCTOBER 31, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to governmental
administration. (BDR 30-464)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions relating to the timing of when an annual
meeting of a debt management commission must occur;
revising the hours the office of the county treasurer is
required to be kept open; revising the contents of a notice
of delinquent taxes; revising provisions relating to certain
property held in trust by the county treasurer; eliminating
the requirement that a school associate superintendent
provide a quarterly report to the governing body of a
county within a local school precinct; revising the notice
requirements relating to applications for certain
franchises; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this
2 State and requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality
3 to incur certain debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an
4 installment-purchase agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law
5 also requires a commission to review and vote on proposals by general
6 improvement districts to issue medium-term obligations, borrow money or issue
7 certain securities, among certain other duties and responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115,
8 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management commission to meet annually in
9 August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in addition to certain other
10 meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
11 annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make conforming
12 changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
-
*SB15_R2*

– 2 –
13 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders
14 and county auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep
15 open the county office and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and
16 nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and on all days except Sundays,
17 nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Existing law also authorizes
18 the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or authorize
19 deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
20 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that
21 the county treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of
22 this bill provides that the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county
23 treasurer may not close earlier than 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later
24 than 5 p.m.
25 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent
26 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information
27 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
28 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
29 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of
30 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
31 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
32 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
33 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
34 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
35 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
36 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
37 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
38 by law for the redemption of a property described in a certificate has expired and no
39 redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required to
40 execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon obtaining
41 such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust until it is
42 sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods or
43 not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
44 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the
45 receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
46 (NRS 361.585) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or
47 not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
48 before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have
49 the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the
50 delinquent taxes and certain costs.
51 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
52 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
53 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
54 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
55 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
56 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
57 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
58 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under
59 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
60 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
61 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
62 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
63 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this
64 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
65 the Clark County School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to
66 oversee one or more local school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law
67 prescribes the duties of a school associate superintendent, including requiring a
-
*SB15_R2*

– 3 –
68 school associate superintendent to provide a report in person, not less than
69 quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a local
70 school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS
71 388G.630) Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
72 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to
73 construct, install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and
74 power lines, gas and water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things.
75 (NRS 709.050) Any person or entity desiring a franchise is required to file an
76 application in writing with the board of county commissioners wherein the
77 franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an application is
78 required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to be:
79 (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
80 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in
81 three public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than
82 one unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the
83 unincorporated towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such
84 requirements to post the notice from three places to one place if more than one
85 unincorporated town is affected by reducing the postings required in public places
86 in each of the unincorporated towns.

13 office at the county seat of their county which, except as otherwise
14 provided in subsections 3 and 4, must be kept open on all days
15 except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 m., and on
16 all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m.
17 to 5 p.m. for the transaction of public business, but nothing
18 contained in this subsection interferes with a duty now required of a
19 public officer under the election laws of this State. County clerks
20 shall keep their offices open on all election days during the hours
21 when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the
22 district judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes
23 except election business and the issuance of marriage licenses on
24 any day on which the primary or general election is held.
25 2. [Notwithstanding] Except as otherwise provided in
26 subsection 5 and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1,
27 the board of county commissioners of any county may, by an order
28 regularly made and entered in the records of its proceedings,
29 designate the days and hours during which the offices of the sheriff,
30 county recorder and county auditor, county clerk, county assessor
31 and county treasurer must be kept open for the transaction of public
32 business. An order so made and entered must require each office to
33 be kept open for not less than 40 hours during each week, and must
34 not prevent the county clerk from closing his or her office for all
35 purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage
36 licenses on primary and general election days as provided in
37 subsection 1.
38 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county
39 officer to rent, equip and operate, at public expense, one or more
40 branch offices in the county. The branch office may be kept open for
41 the transaction of public business on the days and during the hours
42 specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during such
43 hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection
44 do not preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain
45 duties to be performed at the county seat.
-
*SB15_R2*

– 7 –
1 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation
2 required pursuant to this section if the board of county
3 commissioners approves the plan for the deviation submitted by the
4 office, except that no such deviation may conflict with the election
5 laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
6 cost savings.
7 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not
8 designate or approve the county office or branch office, if any, of
9 the county treasurer to close earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction
10 of business on any business day. Nothing in this subsection shall
11 be construed to prohibit the offices from closing later than 5 p.m.
12 6. A county officer who violates the provisions of this section
13 is guilty of a misdemeanor, and if an officer mentioned in
14 subsection 1 absents himself or herself from office, except:
15 (a) When called away from his or her office by official duties;
16 (b) When expressly permitted so to do by the board of county
17 commissioners or a majority of the members thereof in writing; or
18 (c) When he or she makes provision to leave his or her office
19 open for the transaction of public business on the days and during
20 the hours prescribed by this section and in charge of a deputy
21 qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,
22  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary
23 that proportion thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the
24 number of days of the month in which the absence occurs. The
25 money must be withheld from payment of salary to the officer for
26 the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
27 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first
28 giving the officer affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to
29 appear before the board and defend the charge against him or her.
30 Sec. 4. NRS 361.5648 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 361.5648 1. Within 30 days after the first Monday in March

27 period of redemption has expired, the tax receiver shall maintain
28 detailed records which contain such information as the Department

38 names and addresses of persons with an interest in the property,
39 relies upon a preliminary title search from a company authorized to
40 provide title insurance in this State.
41 Sec. 5. NRS 361.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 361.585 1. When the time allowed by law for the redemption
43 of a property described in a certificate has expired and no

8 sale must specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
9 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including
10 one at the courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days

22 other person or governmental entity before the sale.
23 4. If, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to
24 use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property and the
25 requirements of NRS 361.567 were met, notice of the sale must

37 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
38 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
39 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
40 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
41 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
42 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
