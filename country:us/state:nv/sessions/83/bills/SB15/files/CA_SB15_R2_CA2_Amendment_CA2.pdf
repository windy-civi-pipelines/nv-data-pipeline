Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this State and
2 requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality to incur certain
3 debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an installment-purchase
4 agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law also requires a commission to
5 review and vote on proposals by general improvement districts to issue medium-term
6 obligations, borrow money or issue certain securities, among certain other duties and
7 responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115, 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management
8 commission to meet annually in August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in
9 addition to certain other meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the
10 requirement that the annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make
11 conforming changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
12 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county whose
13 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and which is home to a
14 species or subspecies that has been declared endangered or threatened pursuant to
15 federal law to: (1) impose a fee on the construction of a structure or the grading of land

Conference Committee Amendment No. CA2 to
Senate Bill No. 15 Second Reprint Page 4
16 in the unincorporated areas of the county; (2) deposit the money collected from the fee
17 into an enterprise fund; and (3) use the money from the fee to fund an area or zone for
18 the preservation of the endangered or threatened species or subspecies. (NRS 244.386)
19 Existing law also allows the governing body of a city to: (1) impose a similar fee if the
20 county in which the city is located has created such an enterprise fund; (2) deposit the
21 fee into the enterprise fund; and (3) use the money collected from the fee to take certain
22 measures to conserve the endangered or threatened species or subspecies. (NRS
23 268.4413, 268.4415). Sections 3.3, 3.7 and 3.9 of this bill allow the money collected from
24 such fees to also be used for the establishment of plans and programs for the
25 conservation of the habitat and ecosystems in certain areas or zones. Sections 3.3 and 3.7
26 require any such fee collected to be based upon an economic analysis of the cost to carry
27 out such a plan or program for habitat and ecosystem conservation. Section 3.3 also
28 authorizes a board of county commissioners that imposes such a fee to adjust the fee for
29 inflation beginning in Fiscal Year 2026-2027.
30 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders and county
31 auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep open the county office
32 and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12
33 p.m., and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
34 Existing law also authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or
35 authorize deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
36 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that the county
37 treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of this bill provides that
38 the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county treasurer may not close earlier than
39 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later than 5 p.m.
40 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent taxes to
41 certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information including that if the
42 amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at 5 p.m. on the first Monday in
43 June of the current year, issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the
44 property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency
45 must state that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close
46 of business of the tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year,
47 issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
48 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that describes
49 each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs have not been paid. The
50 trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold each property for a certain period
51 of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed by law for the redemption of a property
52 described in a certificate has expired and no redemption has been made, the tax receiver who
53 issued the certificate is required to execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the
54 property. Upon obtaining such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in
55 trust until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods
56 or not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
57 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
58 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs. (NRS 361.585) Section
59 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or not later than the close of business
60 of the county treasurer on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
61 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
62 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
63 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to sell property
64 held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county treasurer is required, with
65 certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the purchaser. Existing law provides an
66 exception to this requirement to issue a quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not
67 later than 5 p.m. on the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the
68 county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets
69 certain requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under certain
70 circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not later than the
71 close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the
72 day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an
73 affidavit that meets certain requirements.

Conference Committee Amendment No. CA2 to
Senate Bill No. 15 Second Reprint Page 5
74 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this State which
75 has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
76 School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to oversee one or more local
77 school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law prescribes the duties of a school associate
78 superintendent, including requiring a school associate superintendent to provide a report in
79 person, not less than quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a
80 local school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS 388G.630)
81 Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
82 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to construct,
83 install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and power lines, gas and
84 water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things. (NRS 709.050) Any person or
85 entity desiring a franchise is required to file an application in writing with the board of county
86 commissioners wherein the franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an
87 application is required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to
88 be: (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
89 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in three
90 public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than one
91 unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the unincorporated
92 towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such requirements to post the notice from
93 three places to one place if more than one unincorporated town is affected by reducing the
94 postings required in public places in each of the unincorporated towns.

27 and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5
28 p.m. for the transaction of public business, but nothing contained in this subsection
29 interferes with a duty now required of a public officer under the election laws of
30 this State. County clerks shall keep their offices open on all election days during the
31 hours when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the district
32 judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes except election business and
33 the issuance of marriage licenses on any day on which the primary or general
34 election is held.
35 2. [Notwithstanding] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5 and
36 notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1, the board of county commissioners
37 of any county may, by an order regularly made and entered in the records of its
38 proceedings, designate the days and hours during which the offices of the sheriff,
39 county recorder and county auditor, county clerk, county assessor and county
40 treasurer must be kept open for the transaction of public business. An order so
41 made and entered must require each office to be kept open for not less than 40

43 her office for all purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage
44 licenses on primary and general election days as provided in subsection 1.
45 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county officer to rent,
46 equip and operate, at public expense, one or more branch offices in the county. The
47 branch office may be kept open for the transaction of public business on the days
48 and during the hours specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during
49 such hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection do not
50 preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain duties to be performed
51 at the county seat.

Conference Committee Amendment No. CA2 to
Senate Bill No. 15 Second Reprint Page 9
1 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation required
2 pursuant to this section if the board of county commissioners approves the plan for
3 the deviation submitted by the office, except that no such deviation may conflict
4 with the election laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
5 cost savings.
6 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not designate or
7 approve the county office or branch office, if any, of the county treasurer to close
8 earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction of business on any business day. Nothing
9 in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the offices from closing later
10 than 5 p.m.
11 6. A county officer who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a
12 misdemeanor, and if an officer mentioned in subsection 1 absents himself or herself
13 from office, except:
14 (a) When called away from his or her office by official duties;
15 (b) When expressly permitted so to do by the board of county commissioners
16 or a majority of the members thereof in writing; or

19 section and in charge of a deputy qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,
20  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary that proportion
21 thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the number of days of the month
22 in which the absence occurs. The money must be withheld from payment of salary
23 to the officer for the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
24 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first giving the officer
25 affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to appear before the board and defend
26 the charge against him or her.
27 Sec. 3.7. NRS 268.4413 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 268.4413 1. The governing body of a city which is located in a county in

32 land within the city for the expense of carrying out the provisions of subsection 1 of
33 NRS 244.386. The fee must be based upon an economic analysis of the cost to
34 carry out a plan or program for the conservation of the habitats and ecosystems
35 pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 244.386 and must be collected at the same time
36 and in the same manner as the fee for the issuance of a building permit collected
37 pursuant to NRS 278.580.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 268.4415, if a fee is imposed

4 of the city if listed as endangered or threatened, including the expenditure for this
5 purpose of money collected pursuant to NRS 268.4413 [.] or the participation in

7 the city may purchase, sell, exchange or lease real property, personal property,
8 water rights, grazing permits and other interests in such property for this purpose,
9 pursuant to such reasonable regulations as the governing body may establish. If any
10 such property, rights or other interests are purchased from a nonprofit organization,

14 specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
15 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including one at the
16 courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days before the day of sale or,
17 in lieu of such a posting, by publication of the notice at least once a week for 4

19 the county, the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale, if
20 the board of county commissioners so directs.
21 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 90 days
22 before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as shown on the tax roll and to
23 any person or governmental entity that appears in the records of the county to have
24 a lien or other interest in the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county
25 treasurer must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or other
26 person or governmental entity before the sale.
27 4. If, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to use an
28 expedited procedure for the sale of the property and the requirements of NRS
29 361.567 were met, notice of the sale must specify the day, time and place of the

36 the board of county commissioners so directs.
37 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 45 days
38 before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as shown on the tax roll and to

48 the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county
49 treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit signed by

52 municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and

Conference Committee Amendment No. CA2 to
Senate Bill No. 15 Second Reprint Page 13
1 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the purchaser pursuant to
2 NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560,
3  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described in subsection 5

6 NRS 271.560 and 271.570 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the
7 treasurer of the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the

9 the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the property by the county is void
10 and the county treasurer may retain for administrative costs not more than 10

12 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record the deed at the
13 expense of the purchaser.
14 8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued before, on or after

20 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal property, the
21 real property belonged to the person liable to pay the tax.
22 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county treasurer until he or
23 she files at the expense of the purchaser, with the clerk of the board of county
24 commissioners, proper affidavits of posting and of publication of the notice of sale,
25 as the case may be, together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing
26 compliance with the order of the board of county commissioners, which constitutes
27 primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
28 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the office of the
29 county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating thereto, is void as against
30 any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration of the same
31 property, or any portion thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
32 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk with a record
33 book in which must be indexed the name of each purchaser, together with the date

49 Community Education Advisory Board; and
50 (e) Carry out any other duties assigned by the superintendent at his or her
51 discretion or after approval by the superintendent of a request made by the local
52 school precinct.

Conference Committee Amendment No. CA2 to
Senate Bill No. 15 Second Reprint Page 14
1 2. The school associate superintendent must be held accountable for all
2 aspects of the performance of each local school precinct to which he or she is

24 3. The notice must be published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a
25 newspaper of general circulation published in the county. If no newspaper is
26 published in the county, notice must be given by the posting of notices as provided
27 in this section.
