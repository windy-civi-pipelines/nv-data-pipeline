Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this
2 State and requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality
3 to incur certain debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an
4 installment-purchase agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law
5 also requires a commission to review and vote on proposals by general
6 improvement districts to issue medium-term obligations, borrow money or issue
7 certain securities, among certain other duties and responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115,
8 350.014) Existing law requires a debt management commission to meet annually in
-
*SB15_R3*

– 2 –
9 August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in addition to certain other
10 meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
11 annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make conforming
12 changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
13 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county whose
14 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and which is home to
15 a species or subspecies that has been declared endangered or threatened pursuant to
16 federal law to: (1) impose a fee on the construction of a structure or the grading of
17 land in the unincorporated areas of the county; (2) deposit the money collected
18 from the fee into an enterprise fund; and (3) use the money from the fee to fund an
19 area or zone for the preservation of the endangered or threatened species or
20 subspecies. (NRS 244.386) Existing law also allows the governing body of a city
21 to: (1) impose a similar fee if the county in which the city is located has created
22 such an enterprise fund; (2) deposit the fee into the enterprise fund; and (3) use the
23 money collected from the fee to take certain measures to conserve the endangered
24 or threatened species or subspecies. (NRS 268.4413, 268.4415). Sections 3.3, 3.7
25 and 3.9 of this bill allow the money collected from such fees to also be used for the
26 establishment of plans and programs for the conservation of the habitat and
27 ecosystems in certain areas or zones. Sections 3.3 and 3.7 require any such fee
28 collected to be based upon an economic analysis of the cost to carry out such a plan
29 or program for habitat and ecosystem conservation. Section 3.3 also authorizes a
30 board of county commissioners that imposes such a fee to adjust the fee for
31 inflation beginning in Fiscal Year 2026-2027.
32 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders
33 and county auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep
34 open the county office and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and
35 nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and on all days except Sundays,
36 nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Existing law also authorizes
37 the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or authorize
38 deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
39 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that
40 the county treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of
41 this bill provides that the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county
42 treasurer may not close earlier than 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later
43 than 5 p.m.
44 Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent
45 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information
46 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
47 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
48 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of
49 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
50 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
51 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
52 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
53 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
54 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
55 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
56 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
57 by law for the redemption of a property described in a certificate has expired and no
58 redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required to
59 execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon obtaining
60 such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust until it is
61 sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods or
62 not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
63 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the
-
*SB15_R3*

– 3 –
64 receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
65 (NRS 361.585) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or
66 not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
67 before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have
68 the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the
69 delinquent taxes and certain costs.
70 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
71 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
72 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
73 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
74 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
75 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
76 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
77 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under
78 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
79 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
80 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
81 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
82 Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this
83 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
84 the Clark County School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to
85 oversee one or more local school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law
86 prescribes the duties of a school associate superintendent, including requiring a
87 school associate superintendent to provide a report in person, not less than
88 quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a local
89 school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS
90 388G.630) Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
91 Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to
92 construct, install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and
93 power lines, gas and water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things.
94 (NRS 709.050) Any person or entity desiring a franchise is required to file an
95 application in writing with the board of county commissioners wherein the
96 franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an application is
97 required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to be:
98 (1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
99 circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in
100 three public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than
101 one unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the
102 unincorporated towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such
103 requirements to post the notice from three places to one place if more than one
104 unincorporated town is affected by reducing the postings required in public places
105 in each of the unincorporated towns.

8 shall keep their offices open on all election days during the hours
9 when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the
10 district judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes

20 business. An order so made and entered must require each office to
21 be kept open for not less than 40 hours during each week, and must
22 not prevent the county clerk from closing his or her office for all
23 purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage

25 subsection 1.
26 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county

29 the transaction of public business on the days and during the hours
30 specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during such
31 hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection
32 do not preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain
33 duties to be performed at the county seat.
34 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation
35 required pursuant to this section if the board of county
36 commissioners approves the plan for the deviation submitted by the
37 office, except that no such deviation may conflict with the election
38 laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
39 cost savings.
40 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not
41 designate or approve the county office or branch office, if any, of
42 the county treasurer to close earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction

10 qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,
11  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary
12 that proportion thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the
13 number of days of the month in which the absence occurs. The
14 money must be withheld from payment of salary to the officer for
15 the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
16 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first
17 giving the officer affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to

30 time and in the same manner as the fee for the issuance of a building

11 pursuant to NRS 268.4413 [.] or the participation in an agreement
12 made pursuant to NRS 503.589 or 527.300. The governing body of
13 the city may purchase, sell, exchange or lease real property, personal
14 property, water rights, grazing permits and other interests in such

1 Sec. 6. NRS 361.595 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 361.595 1. Any property held in trust by any county treasurer
3 by virtue of any deed made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
4 may be sold and conveyed in the manner prescribed in this section

13 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, notice of the
14 sale must specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
15 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including
16 one at the courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days
17 before the day of sale or, in lieu of such a posting, by publication of
18 the notice at least once a week for 4 consecutive weeks by four
19 weekly insertions in some newspaper published within the county,
20 the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale,
21 if the board of county commissioners so directs.
22 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less
23 than 90 days before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as
24 shown on the tax roll and to any person or governmental entity that
25 appears in the records of the county to have a lien or other interest in
26 the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county treasurer
27 must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or
28 other person or governmental entity before the sale.
29 4. If, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to
30 use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property and the
31 requirements of NRS 361.567 were met, notice of the sale must
32 specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
33 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including

-
*SB15_R3*

– 14 –
1 must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or
2 other person or governmental entity before the sale.
3 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
4 treasurer shall make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon
5 payment to the county treasurer, as trustee, of a consideration not
6 less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim deed, discharged of
7 any trust of the property mentioned in the order.
8 6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county
9 treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the day
10 of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the
11 county treasurer with an affidavit signed by the treasurer of the
12 municipality stating that:
13 (a) The municipality sold the property or the property was
14 stricken off to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
15 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the
16 purchaser pursuant to NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant
17 to NRS 271.560,
18  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described

21 the certificate of sale issued pursuant to NRS 271.560 and 271.570
22 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the treasurer of
23 the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
24 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within
25 20 days after the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the
26 property by the county is void and the county treasurer may retain
27 for administrative costs not more than 10 percent of the purchase
28 amount paid by the purchaser.
29 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record
30 the deed at the expense of the purchaser.
31 8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued
32 before, on or after July 1, 1955, are primary evidence:
33 (a) Of the regularity of all proceedings relating to the order of
34 the board of county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of
35 the property;
36 (b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has
37 elected to use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property,
38 the property is abandoned; and
39 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal
40 property, the real property belonged to the person liable to pay the
41 tax.
42 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county
43 treasurer until he or she files at the expense of the purchaser, with
44 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
45 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
-
*SB15_R3*

– 15 –
1 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
2 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
3 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
4 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
5 office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
6 thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
7 and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
8 thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
9 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
10 with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each
11 purchaser, together with the date of sale, a description of the
12 property sold, a reference to the book and page of the minutes of the
13 board of county commissioners where the order of sale is recorded,
14 and the file number of the affidavits and return.

30 and, if created pursuant to NRS 388G.760, to the Community
31 Education Advisory Board; and
32 (e) Carry out any other duties assigned by the superintendent at
33 his or her discretion or after approval by the superintendent of a

35 2. The school associate superintendent must be held

– 16 –
1 (b) The progress made by the local school precinct to satisfy the

19 the hearing, or must appear at the meeting and present their
20 objections at that time.
21 3. The notice must be published once each week for 4
