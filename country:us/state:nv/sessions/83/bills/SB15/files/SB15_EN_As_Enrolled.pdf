Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates a debt management commission in each county of this
State and requires a commission to review and vote on proposals of a municipality
to incur certain debts, levy a special elective tax, issue certain bonds or enter into an
installment-purchase agreement with a term of more than 10 years. Existing law
also requires a commission to review and vote on proposals by general
improvement districts to issue medium-term obligations, borrow money or issue
certain securities, among certain other duties and responsibilities. (NRS 350.0115,
350.014) Existing law requires a debt management commission to meet annually in
August and at the call of the chair for certain purposes, in addition to certain other
meetings. (NRS 350.012) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
annual meeting be held in August. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill make conforming
changes to remove references to the annual meeting being held in August.
Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county whose
population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and which is home to
a species or subspecies that has been declared endangered or threatened pursuant to
federal law to: (1) impose a fee on the construction of a structure or the grading of
land in the unincorporated areas of the county; (2) deposit the money collected
from the fee into an enterprise fund; and (3) use the money from the fee to fund an
area or zone for the preservation of the endangered or threatened species or
subspecies. (NRS 244.386) Existing law also allows the governing body of a city
to: (1) impose a similar fee if the county in which the city is located has created
such an enterprise fund; (2) deposit the fee into the enterprise fund; and (3) use the
money collected from the fee to take certain measures to conserve the endangered
or threatened species or subspecies. (NRS 268.4413, 268.4415). Sections 3.3, 3.7
and 3.9 of this bill allow the money collected from such fees to also be used for the
establishment of plans and programs for the conservation of the habitat and
ecosystems in certain areas or zones. Sections 3.3 and 3.7 require any such fee
collected to be based upon an economic analysis of the cost to carry out such a plan
or program for habitat and ecosystem conservation. Section 3.3 also authorizes a
-

board of county commissioners that imposes such a fee to adjust the fee for
inflation beginning in Fiscal Year 2026-2027.
Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders
and county auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep
open the county office and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and
nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and on all days except Sundays,
nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Existing law also authorizes
the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or authorize
deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that
the county treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 3.5 of
this bill provides that the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county
treasurer may not close earlier than 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later
than 5 p.m.
Existing law requires the tax receiver of the county to mail notice of delinquent
taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information
including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 4 of
this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
by law for the redemption of a property described in a certificate has expired and no
redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required to
execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon obtaining
such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust until it is
sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain periods or
not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the
receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
(NRS 361.585) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or
not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have
the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the
delinquent taxes and certain costs.
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 6 of this bill provides instead that, under
certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.

Existing law requires the superintendent of schools in a school district in this
State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
the Clark County School District) to assign a school associate superintendent to
oversee one or more local school precincts. (NRS 388G.620) Existing law
prescribes the duties of a school associate superintendent, including requiring a
school associate superintendent to provide a report in person, not less than
quarterly, to the governing body of each city and county within which a local
school precinct to which he or she is assigned to oversee is located. (NRS
388G.630) Section 7 of this bill eliminates the requirement to report to a county.
Exiting law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant a franchise to
construct, install, operate, and maintain street railways, electric light, heat and
power lines, gas and water mains and telephone lines, among certain other things.
(NRS 709.050) Any person or entity desiring a franchise is required to file an
application in writing with the board of county commissioners wherein the
franchise is to be exercised. (NRS 709.060) Notice of such an application is
required to be given at the next regular meeting of the board and is required to be:
(1) published once each week for 4 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the county, subject to certain exceptions; and (2) posted in
three public places nearest where the application will take effect, and if more than
one unincorporated town is affected, posted in three public places in each of the
unincorporated towns. (NRS 709.070) Section 8 of this bill revises such
requirements to post the notice from three places to one place if more than one
unincorporated town is affected by reducing the postings required in public places
in each of the unincorporated towns.

number of days of the month in which the absence occurs. The
money must be withheld from payment of salary to the officer for

commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first
giving the officer affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to

361.595 1. Any property held in trust by any county treasurer
by virtue of any deed made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
may be sold and conveyed in the manner prescribed in this section
and in NRS 361.603 or conveyed without sale as provided in

2. If the property is to be sold, the board of county

proceedings, directing the county treasurer to sell the property
particularly described therein, after giving notice of sale, for a total
amount not less than the amount of the taxes, costs, penalties and
interest legally chargeable against the property as stated in the order.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, notice of the
sale must specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
(a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including
one at the courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days
before the day of sale or, in lieu of such a posting, by publication of

(b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less
than 45 days before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as
shown on the tax roll and to any person or governmental entity that
appears in the records of the county to have a lien or other interest in
the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county treasurer
must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or
other person or governmental entity before the sale.
5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
treasurer shall make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon
payment to the county treasurer, as trustee, of a consideration not
less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim deed, discharged of
any trust of the property mentioned in the order.
6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county
treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the day
of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the
county treasurer with an affidavit signed by the treasurer of the
municipality stating that:
(a) The municipality sold the property or the property was
stricken off to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
(b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the
purchaser pursuant to NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant
to NRS 271.560,
 the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described
in subsection 5 unless the person who purchased the property from
the county pays to the municipality any amount owed pursuant to
the certificate of sale issued pursuant to NRS 271.560 and 271.570
and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the treasurer of
the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within
20 days after the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the
property by the county is void and the county treasurer may retain
for administrative costs not more than 10 percent of the purchase
amount paid by the purchaser.
7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record
the deed at the expense of the purchaser.
8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued

the board of county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of
the property;
(b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has

the property is abandoned; and
-

– 15 –
(c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal
property, the real property belonged to the person liable to pay the
tax.
9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county
treasurer until he or she files at the expense of the purchaser, with
the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each
purchaser, together with the date of sale, a description of the
property sold, a reference to the book and page of the minutes of the
board of county commissioners where the order of sale is recorded,
