SUMMARY—Revises certain provisions governing motor vehicles.
(BDR 43-304)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; expanding to certain employees
of the Department of Motor Vehicles the authority to
inspect vehicles to determine rightful ownership or
possession; requiring businesses that repair certain
motortrucks to comply with provisions regulating
garages, garage operators and body shops; authorizing
certain employees of the Department to apply for certain
court orders and complete necessary affidavits for such
orders; revising provisions prohibiting a person from
tampering with a device for the control of emissions of a
motor vehicle or removing such a device from a motor
vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an employee of the Department of Public Safety or a
2 local law enforcement agency whose primary responsibility is to conduct
3 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to inspect, under certain
4 circumstances, the identification numbers of a vehicle and the title or registration of
5 a vehicle or a part of the vehicle for the purpose of locating stolen vehicles. (NRS
6 480.610) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes an employee of the
7 Department of Motor Vehicles whose primary responsibility is to conduct
8 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to conduct such an inspection.

9 Existing law exempts a business that only performs services on motortrucks
10 with a gross weight of more than 10,000 pounds from: (1) the requirement to be
11 registered as a garage or licensed as a body shop; and (2) other requirements
12 governing the operation of garages and body shops. (NRS 487.532, 487.540,
13 487.550, 487.560-487.687) Section 4 of this bill removes that exemption, thereby
14 requiring such a business to comply with those requirements.
15 Existing law requires a person to obtain an order from a court before installing
16 or using a pen register or trap and trace device, except as otherwise authorized by
17 federal law. Existing law authorizes a peace officer to apply for such an order if an
18 application is supported by an affidavit by a peace officer that complies with
19 federal law. (NRS 179.530) Section 6 of this bill additionally authorizes personnel
20 of the Department of Motor Vehicles who have the powers of a peace officer to
21 apply for such an order from a court and complete the required supporting
22 affidavits.
23 Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) possess or issue fraudulent
24 or unauthorized evidence that a motor vehicle complies with the required
25 equipment for the control of emissions from engines; or (2) willfully and
26 knowingly fail to comply with any provision relating to the control of emissions
27 from engines. (NRS 445B.840) Section 7 of this bill establishes circumstances
28 under which exchanging the engine of a motor vehicle for a different engine is not
29 unlawful. A violation of the prohibitions imposed by section 7 would be a
30 misdemeanor. (NRS 445B.845)
