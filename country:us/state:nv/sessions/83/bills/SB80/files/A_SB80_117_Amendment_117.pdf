EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; expanding to certain employees of the
Department of Motor Vehicles the authority to inspect vehicles to
determine rightful ownership or possession; [increasing penalties for
multiple violations of certain provisions governing automobile
wreckers, salvage pools, garages, garage operators and body shops;]
requiring businesses that repair certain motortrucks to comply with
provisions regulating garages, garage operators and body shops;
authorizing certain employees of the Department to apply for certain
court orders and complete necessary affidavits for such orders; revising
provisions prohibiting a person from tampering with a device for the
control of emissions of a motor vehicle or removing such a device
from a motor vehicle; [providing penalties;] and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an employee of the Department of Public Safety or a local law
2 enforcement agency whose primary responsibility is to conduct investigations involving the
3 theft of motor vehicles to inspect, under certain circumstances, the identification numbers of a
4 vehicle and the title or registration of a vehicle or a part of the vehicle for the purpose of
5 locating stolen vehicles. (NRS 480.610) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes an
6 employee of the Department of Motor Vehicles whose primary responsibility is to conduct
7 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to conduct such an inspection.
8 [Existing law requires automobile wreckers, operators of salvage pools, garage operators
9 and operators of body shops to comply with certain requirements relating to licensing or
10 registration, recordkeeping and operations. (NRS 487.047-487.200, 487.400-487.510,
11 487.530-487.690) A person is guilty of a misdemeanor for violations of those provisions.
12 (NRS 487.200, 487.510, 487.690) Sections 2, 3 and 5 of this bill revise the penalty for
13 violations of those provisions, with certain exceptions, such that a person is guilty of: (1) for
14 the first offense, a misdemeanor punishable by a term of imprisonment in the county jail for
15 not more than 6 months, or a fine of not more than $2,500, or both; (2) for the second offense,

Senate Amendment No. 117 to Senate Bill No. 80 Page 4
16 a gross misdemeanor punishable by a term of imprisonment in the county jail for not more
17 than 6 months, or a fine of not more than $5,000, or both; and (3) for the third and each
18 subsequent offense, a gross misdemeanor punishable by a term of imprisonment in the county
19 jail for not more than 6 months, or a fine of not more than $10,000, or both.]
20 Existing law exempts a business that only performs services on motortrucks with a gross
21 weight of more than 10,000 pounds from: (1) the requirement to be registered as a garage or
22 licensed as a body shop; and (2) other requirements governing the operation of garages and
23 body shops. (NRS 487.532, 487.540, 487.550, 487.560-487.687) Section 4 of this bill
24 removes that exemption, thereby requiring such a business to comply with those requirements.
25 Existing law requires a person to obtain an order from a court before installing or using a
26 pen register or trap and trace device, except [if] as otherwise authorized by federal law.
27 Existing law authorizes a peace officer to apply for such an order if an application is
28 supported by an affidavit by a peace officer that complies with federal law. (NRS 179.530)
29 Section 6 of this bill additionally authorizes personnel of the Department of Motor Vehicles
30 who have the powers of a peace officer to apply for such an order from a court and complete
31 the required supporting affidavits.
32 Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) possess or issue fraudulent or
33 unauthorized evidence that a motor vehicle complies with the required equipment for the
34 control of emissions from engines; or (2) willfully and knowingly fail to comply with any
35 provision relating to the control of emissions from engines. (NRS 445B.840) Section 7 of this
36 bill [additionally makes it unlawful for a person to tamper with or remove an emission control
37 device from a motor vehicle, including] establishes circumstances under which exchanging
38 the engine of a motor vehicle for a different engine [, except where certain conditions are
39 satisfied.] is not unlawful. A violation of the prohibitions imposed by section 7 would be a
40 misdemeanor. (NRS 445B.845)
