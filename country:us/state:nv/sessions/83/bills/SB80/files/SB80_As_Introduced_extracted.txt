EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; expanding to certain employees
of the Department of Motor Vehicles the authority to
inspect vehicles to determine rightful ownership or
possession; increasing penalties for multiple violations of
certain provisions governing automobile wreckers,
salvage pools, garages, garage operators and body shops;
requiring businesses that repair certain motortrucks to
comply with provisions regulating garages, garage
operators and body shops; authorizing certain employees
of the Department to apply for certain court orders and
complete necessary affidavits for such orders; revising
provisions prohibiting a person from tampering with a
device for the control of emissions of a motor vehicle or
removing such a device from a motor vehicle; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an employee of the Department of Public Safety or a
2 local law enforcement agency whose primary responsibility is to conduct
3 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to inspect, under certain
4 circumstances, the identification numbers of a vehicle and the title or registration of
5 a vehicle or a part of the vehicle for the purpose of locating stolen vehicles. (NRS
6 480.610) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes an employee of the
-
*SB80*
– 2 –
7 Department of Motor Vehicles whose primary responsibility is to conduct
8 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to conduct such an inspection.
9 Existing law requires automobile wreckers, operators of salvage pools, garage
10 operators and operators of body shops to comply with certain requirements relating
11 to licensing or registration, recordkeeping and operations. (NRS 487.047-487.200,
12 487.400-487.510, 487.530-487.690) A person is guilty of a misdemeanor for
13 violations of those provisions. (NRS 487.200, 487.510, 487.690) Sections 2, 3 and
14 5 of this bill revise the penalty for violations of those provisions, with certain
15 exceptions, such that a person is guilty of: (1) for the first offense, a misdemeanor
16 punishable by a term of imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6
17 months, or a fine of not more than $2,500, or both; (2) for the second offense, a
18 gross misdemeanor punishable by a term of imprisonment in the county jail for not
19 more than 6 months, or a fine of not more than $5,000, or both; and (3) for the third
20 and each subsequent offense, a gross misdemeanor punishable by a term of
21 imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months, or a fine of not more
22 than $10,000, or both.
23 Existing law exempts a business that only performs services on motortrucks
24 with a gross weight of more than 10,000 pounds from: (1) the requirement to be
25 registered as a garage or licensed as a body shop; and (2) other requirements
26 governing the operation of garages and body shops. (NRS 487.532, 487.540,
27 487.550, 487.560-487.687) Section 4 of this bill removes that exemption, thereby
28 requiring such a business to comply with those requirements.
29 Existing law requires a person to obtain an order from a court before installing
30 or using a pen register or trap and trace device, except if otherwise authorized by
31 federal law. Existing law authorizes a peace officer to apply for such an order if an
32 application is supported by an affidavit by a peace officer that complies with
33 federal law. (NRS 179.530) Section 6 of this bill additionally authorizes personnel
34 of the Department of Motor Vehicles who have the powers of a peace officer to
35 apply for such an order from a court and complete the required supporting
36 affidavits.
37 Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) possess or issue fraudulent
38 or unauthorized evidence that a motor vehicle complies with the required
39 equipment for the control of emissions from engines; or (2) willfully and
40 knowingly fail to comply with any provision relating to the control of emissions
41 from engines. (NRS 445B.840) Section 7 of this bill additionally makes it unlawful
42 for a person to tamper with or remove an emission control device from a motor
43 vehicle, including exchanging the engine of a motor vehicle for a different engine,
44 except where certain conditions are satisfied. A violation of the prohibitions
45 imposed by section 7 would be a misdemeanor. (NRS 445B.845)
