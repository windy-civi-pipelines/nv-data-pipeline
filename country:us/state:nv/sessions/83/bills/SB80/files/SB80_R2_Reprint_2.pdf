Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an employee of the Department of Public Safety or a
2 local law enforcement agency whose primary responsibility is to conduct
3 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to inspect, under certain
4 circumstances, the identification numbers of a vehicle and the title or registration of
5 a vehicle or a part of the vehicle for the purpose of locating stolen vehicles. (NRS
6 480.610) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes an employee of the
7 Department of Motor Vehicles whose primary responsibility is to conduct
8 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to conduct such an inspection.
9 Existing law requires a person to obtain an order from a court before installing
10 or using a pen register or trap and trace device, except as otherwise authorized by
11 federal law. Existing law authorizes a peace officer to apply for such an order if an

12 application is supported by an affidavit by a peace officer that complies with
13 federal law. (NRS 179.530) Section 6 of this bill additionally authorizes personnel
14 of the Department of Motor Vehicles who have the powers of a peace officer to
15 apply for such an order from a court and complete the required supporting
16 affidavits.
17 Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) possess or issue fraudulent
18 or unauthorized evidence that a motor vehicle complies with the required
19 equipment for the control of emissions from engines; or (2) willfully and
20 knowingly fail to comply with any provision relating to the control of emissions
21 from engines. (NRS 445B.840) Section 7 of this bill prohibits a person from
22 tampering with a device for the control of emissions of a motor vehicle or removing
23 such a device from a motor vehicle. Section 7 establishes circumstances under
24 which exchanging the engine of a motor vehicle for a different engine does not
25 violate this prohibition. Section 7 additionally prohibits a person from possessing
26 an electronic device capable of tampering with a device for the control of emissions
27 of a motor vehicle. A violation of the prohibitions imposed by section 7 would be a
28 misdemeanor. (NRS 445B.845)
