EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; expanding to certain employees of the
Department of Motor Vehicles the authority to inspect vehicles to
determine rightful ownership or possession; [requiring businesses that
repair certain motortrucks to comply with provisions regulating
garages, garage operators and body shops;] authorizing certain
employees of the Department to apply for certain court orders and
complete necessary affidavits for such orders; [revising provisions]
prohibiting a person from tampering with a device for the control of
emissions of a motor vehicle or removing such a device from a motor
vehicle; prohibiting a person from possessing an electronic device
capable of tampering with a device for the control of emissions of a
motor vehicle; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an employee of the Department of Public Safety or a local law
2 enforcement agency whose primary responsibility is to conduct investigations involving the
3 theft of motor vehicles to inspect, under certain circumstances, the identification numbers of a
4 vehicle and the title or registration of a vehicle or a part of the vehicle for the purpose of
5 locating stolen vehicles. (NRS 480.610) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes an
6 employee of the Department of Motor Vehicles whose primary responsibility is to conduct
7 investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to conduct such an inspection.
8 [Existing law exempts a business that only performs services on motortrucks with a gross
9 weight of more than 10,000 pounds from: (1) the requirement to be registered as a garage or
10 licensed as a body shop; and (2) other requirements governing the operation of garages and
11 body shops. (NRS 487.532, 487.540, 487.550, 487.560-487.687) Section 4 of this bill
12 removes that exemption, thereby requiring such a business to comply with those
13 requirements.]
14 Existing law requires a person to obtain an order from a court before installing or using a
15 pen register or trap and trace device, except as otherwise authorized by federal law. Existing

Assembly Amendment No. 710 to Senate Bill No. 80 First Reprint Page 4
16 law authorizes a peace officer to apply for such an order if an application is supported by an
17 affidavit by a peace officer that complies with federal law. (NRS 179.530) Section 6 of this
18 bill additionally authorizes personnel of the Department of Motor Vehicles who have the
19 powers of a peace officer to apply for such an order from a court and complete the required
20 supporting affidavits.
21 Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) possess or issue fraudulent or
22 unauthorized evidence that a motor vehicle complies with the required equipment for the
23 control of emissions from engines; or (2) willfully and knowingly fail to comply with any
24 provision relating to the control of emissions from engines. (NRS 445B.840) Section 7 of this
25 bill prohibits a person from tampering with a device for the control of emissions of a
26 motor vehicle or removing such a device from a motor vehicle. Section 7 establishes
27 circumstances under which exchanging the engine of a motor vehicle for a different engine [is
28 not unlawful.] does not violate this prohibition. Section 7 additionally prohibits a person
29 from possessing an electronic device capable of tampering with a device for the control
30 of emissions of a motor vehicle. A violation of the prohibitions imposed by section 7 would
31 be a misdemeanor. (NRS 445B.845)
