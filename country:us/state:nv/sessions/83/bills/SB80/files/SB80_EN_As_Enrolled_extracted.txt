Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes an employee of the Department of Public Safety or a
local law enforcement agency whose primary responsibility is to conduct
investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to inspect, under certain
circumstances, the identification numbers of a vehicle and the title or registration of
a vehicle or a part of the vehicle for the purpose of locating stolen vehicles. (NRS

Section 2:
480.610) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes an employee of the
Department of Motor Vehicles whose primary responsibility is to conduct
investigations involving the theft of motor vehicles to conduct such an inspection.
Existing law requires a person to obtain an order from a court before installing
or using a pen register or trap and trace device, except as otherwise authorized by
federal law. Existing law authorizes a peace officer to apply for such an order if an
application is supported by an affidavit by a peace officer that complies with
federal law. (NRS 179.530) Section 6 of this bill additionally authorizes personnel
of the Department of Motor Vehicles who have the powers of a peace officer to
apply for such an order from a court and complete the required supporting
affidavits.
Existing law makes it unlawful for a person to: (1) possess or issue fraudulent
or unauthorized evidence that a motor vehicle complies with the required
equipment for the control of emissions from engines; or (2) willfully and
knowingly fail to comply with any provision relating to the control of emissions
from engines. (NRS 445B.840) Section 7 of this bill prohibits a person from
tampering with a device for the control of emissions of a motor vehicle or removing
such a device from a motor vehicle. Section 7 establishes circumstances under
which exchanging the engine of a motor vehicle for a different engine does not
violate this prohibition. Section 7 additionally prohibits a person from possessing
an electronic device capable of tampering with a device for the control of emissions
of a motor vehicle. A violation of the prohibitions imposed by section 7 would be a
misdemeanor. (NRS 445B.845)
