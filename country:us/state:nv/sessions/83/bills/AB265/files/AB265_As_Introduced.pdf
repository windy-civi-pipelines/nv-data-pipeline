29 water right or an application or permit to change the place of diversion, manner of
30 use or place of use of water to file a report of conveyance with the State Engineer.

39 statement describing the works actually constructed, a statement that includes
40 certain information relating to the application of water to beneficial use and an
41 accompanying map under certain circumstances by the date set for completion of
42 the work and the date set for application of water to beneficial use, respectively;
43 and (2) the State Engineer to hold the permit for cancellation if these proofs are not
44 filed by these dates. (NRS 533.390, 533.400, 533.405, 533.410) Sections 6 and 7
45 of this bill require the State Engineer to notify the holder of a permit not later than
46 30 days before the date set for the completion of such work and the date set for the

49 use is not filed by such date.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 533 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. If the State Engineer assigns a committee within the
4 Division of Water Resources of the State Department of
5 Conservation and Natural Resources to review an application for
6 a permit to appropriate water or to change the place of diversion,
7 manner of use or place of use, the Division shall notify the
8 applicant of the assignment and the date on which the application
9 will be reviewed by the committee.
10 2. The review of an application pursuant to subsection 1 must
11 be completed not later than:
12 (a) Thirty days after the final date for filing a protest pursuant
13 to NRS 533.365, if no protests were filed during the period for
14 filing a protest; or
-
*AB265*

– 3 –
1 (b) Sixty days after the final date for filing a protest pursuant
2 to NRS 533.365, if a protest was filed during the period for filing a
3 protest.
4 Sec. 2. NRS 533.355 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 533.355 1. Upon receipt of an application, the State Engineer
6 shall make an endorsement thereon of the date of its receipt and
7 shall keep a record of the date. The State Engineer shall provide the
8 application forms at no cost to the applicants.
9 2. Except as provided in subsection 3, if upon examination, the
10 application is found to be defective, it must be returned for
11 correction or completion with advice of the reasons therefor, and the
12 date of the return must be endorsed upon the application and a
13 record made of it in the Office of the State Engineer. An application
14 does not lose its priority of filing on account of defects if the
15 application, properly corrected and accompanied by such maps and
16 drawings as may be required, is filed in the Office of the State
17 Engineer within 60 days after the date of the return to applicant.
18 Any application returned for correction or completion, not refiled in
19 proper form within the 60 days, must be cancelled. For good cause
20 shown, upon application made prior to the expiration of the 60-day
21 period, the State Engineer may, in his or her discretion, grant an
22 extension of time not to exceed 60 days in which to file the
23 instruments. The State Engineer shall approve or deny an
24 application for an extension of time not later than 30 days after
25 the date the application is received by the State Engineer.
26 3. If it appears to the State Engineer that an application, which
27 contains information of sufficient accuracy to determine the manner
28 of use and the location from which the water is to be diverted, must
29 be rejected, the State Engineer may reject it without returning it for
30 correction.
31 4. All applications which comply with the provisions of this
32 chapter must be recorded in a suitable book kept for that purpose.
33 Sec. 3. NRS 533.370 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 533.370 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and
35 NRS 533.0241, 533.345, 533.371, 533.372 and 533.503, the State
36 Engineer shall approve an application submitted in proper form
37 which contemplates the application of water to beneficial use if:
38 (a) The application is accompanied by the prescribed fees;
39 (b) The proposed use or change, if within an irrigation district,
40 does not adversely affect the cost of water for other holders of water
41 rights in the district or lessen the efficiency of the district in its
42 delivery or use of water; and
43 (c) The applicant provides proof satisfactory to the State
44 Engineer of the applicant’s:
-
*AB265*

– 4 –
1 (1) Intention in good faith to construct any work necessary to
2 apply the water to the intended beneficial use with reasonable
3 diligence; and
4 (2) Financial ability and reasonable expectation actually to
5 construct the work and apply the water to the intended beneficial use
6 with reasonable diligence.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [10,] 11, where
8 there is no unappropriated water in the proposed source of supply,
9 where the groundwater that has not been committed for use has been
10 reserved pursuant to NRS 533.0241 or where its proposed use or
11 change conflicts with existing rights or with protectable interests in
12 existing domestic wells as set forth in NRS 533.024, or threatens to
13 prove detrimental to the public interest, the State Engineer shall
14 reject the application and refuse to issue the requested permit. If a
15 previous application for a similar use of water within the same basin
16 has been rejected on those grounds, the new application may be
17 denied without publication.
18 3. In addition to the criteria set forth in subsections 1 and 2, in
19 determining whether an application for an interbasin transfer of
20 groundwater must be rejected pursuant to this section, the State
21 Engineer shall consider:
22 (a) Whether the applicant has justified the need to import the
23 water from another basin;
24 (b) If the State Engineer determines that a plan for conservation
25 of water is advisable for the basin into which the water is to be
26 imported, whether the applicant has demonstrated that such a plan
27 has been adopted and is being effectively carried out;
28 (c) Whether the proposed action is environmentally sound as it
29 relates to the basin from which the water is exported;
30 (d) Whether the proposed action is an appropriate long-term use
31 which will not unduly limit the future growth and development in
32 the basin from which the water is exported; and
33 (e) Any other factor the State Engineer determines to be
34 relevant.
35 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
36 subsections 6 , 7 and [10] 11 and NRS 533.365, the State Engineer
37 shall approve or reject each application within 2 years after the final
38 date for filing a protest. The State Engineer may postpone action:

40 (b) If an application is protested.
41 (c) If the purpose for which the application was made is
42 municipal use.

44 determined to be necessary by the State Engineer pursuant to
45 NRS 533.368.

4 deemed necessary by the State Engineer.
5 (g) On an application for a permit to change a vested water right
6 in a basin where vested water rights have not been adjudicated.

8 for which the application is submitted is required from a
9 governmental agency.
10 (i) On an application for which the State Engineer has required
11 additional information pursuant to NRS 533.375.

13 accordance with subsections 4 and 6, the application remains active
14 until approved or rejected by the State Engineer.
15 6. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
16 subsection [10,] 11, the State Engineer shall approve or reject,
17 within 6 months after the final date for filing a protest, an
18 application filed to change the point of diversion of water already
19 appropriated when the existing and proposed points of diversion are
20 on the same property for which the water has already been
21 appropriated under the existing water right or the proposed point of
22 diversion is on real property that is proven to be owned by the
23 applicant and is contiguous to the place of use of the existing water
24 right. The State Engineer may postpone action on the application
25 pursuant to subsection 4.
26 7. Not later than 30 days after the final date for filing a
27 protest pursuant to NRS 533.365, if no protests were filed during
28 the period for filing a protest, the State Engineer shall approve or
29 reject an application to appropriate water that results in a
30 nonconsumptive use.
31 8. If the State Engineer has not approved, rejected or held a
32 hearing on an application within 7 years after the final date for filing
33 a protest, the State Engineer shall cause notice of the application to
34 be republished and reposted pursuant to NRS 533.360 immediately
35 preceding the time at which the State Engineer is ready to approve
36 or reject the application. The cost of the republication must be paid
37 by the applicant. After such republication and reposting, a protest
38 may be filed in accordance with NRS 533.365.
39 [8.] 9. If a hearing is held regarding an application, the
40 decision of the State Engineer must be in writing and include
41 findings of fact, conclusions of law and a statement of the
42 underlying facts supporting the findings of fact. The written
43 decision may take the form of a transcription of an oral ruling. The
44 rejection or approval of an application must be endorsed on a copy
45 of the original application, and a record must be made of the
-
*AB265*

1 endorsement in the records of the State Engineer. The copy of the
2 application so endorsed must be returned to the applicant. Except as
3 otherwise provided in subsection [11,] 12, if the application is
4 approved, the applicant may, on receipt thereof, proceed with the
5 construction of the necessary works and take all steps required to
6 apply the water to beneficial use and to perfect the proposed
7 appropriation. If the application is rejected, the applicant may take
8 no steps toward the prosecution of the proposed work or the
9 diversion and use of the public water while the rejection continues
10 in force.
11 [9.] 10. If a person is the successor in interest of an owner of a
12 water right or an owner of real property upon which a domestic well
13 is located and if the former owner of the water right or real property
14 on which a domestic well is located had previously filed a written
15 protest against the granting of an application, the successor in
16 interest must be allowed to pursue that protest in the same manner
17 as if the successor in interest were the former owner whose interest
18 he or she succeeded. If the successor in interest wishes to pursue the
19 protest, the successor in interest must notify the State Engineer in a
20 timely manner on a form provided by the State Engineer.
21 [10.] 11. The provisions of subsections 1 to [9,] 10, inclusive,

26 administered by the Division of State Lands of the State Department
27 of Conservation and Natural Resources without the appropriate
28 authorization for that use from the State Land Registrar.
29 [12.] 13. As used in this section, “domestic well” has the
30 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 534.350.
31 Sec. 4. NRS 533.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 533.380 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,] 6,
33 in an endorsement of approval upon any application, the State
34 Engineer shall:
35 (a) Set a time before which the construction of the work must be
36 completed, which must be within 5 years after the date of approval.
37 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, set a time
38 before which the complete application of water to a beneficial use
39 must be made, which must not exceed 10 years after the date of the
40 approval. The time set under this paragraph respecting an
41 application for a permit to apply water to a municipal or quasi-
42 municipal use on any land:
43 (1) For which a final subdivision map has been recorded
44 pursuant to chapter 278 of NRS;
-
*AB265*

– 7 –
1 (2) For which a plan for the development of a project has
2 been approved by the local government pursuant to NRS 278.010 to
3 278.460, inclusive; or
4 (3) On any land for which a plan for the development of a
5 planned unit development has been recorded pursuant to chapter
6 278A of NRS,
7  must not be less than 5 years.
8 2. The State Engineer may limit the applicant to a smaller
9 quantity of water, to a shorter time for the completion of work, and,
10 except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of subsection 1, to a
11 shorter time for the perfecting of the application than named in the
12 application.
13 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [4] 5 and NRS
14 533.395 and 533.4377, the State Engineer may, for good cause
15 shown, grant any number of extensions of time within which
16 construction work must be completed, or water must be applied to a
17 beneficial use under any permit therefor issued by the State
18 Engineer, but a single extension of time must not exceed 5 years.
19 The State Engineer shall approve or deny an application for an
20 extension of time not later than 30 days after the date the
21 application is received by the State Engineer.
22 4. An application for [the] an extension of time submitted
23 pursuant to subsection 3 must in all cases be:
24 (a) Made within 30 days following notice by registered or
25 certified mail that proof of the work is due as provided for in NRS
26 533.390 and 533.410; and
27 (b) Accompanied by proof and evidence of the good faith and
28 reasonable diligence with which the applicant is pursuing the
29 perfection of the application.
30  The State Engineer shall not grant an extension of time unless the
31 State Engineer determines from the proof and evidence so submitted
32 that the applicant is proceeding in good faith and with reasonable
33 diligence to perfect the application. The failure to provide the proof
34 and evidence required pursuant to this subsection is prima facie
35 evidence that the holder is not proceeding in good faith and with
36 reasonable diligence to perfect the application.
37 [4.] 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5] 6 and
38 NRS 533.395, whenever the holder of a permit issued for any
39 municipal or quasi-municipal use of water on any land referred to in
40 paragraph (b) of subsection 1, or for any use which may be served
41 by a county, city, town, public water district or public water
42 company, requests an extension of time to apply the water to a
43 beneficial use, the State Engineer shall, in determining whether to
44 grant or deny the extension, consider, among other factors:
-
*AB265*

– 8 –
1 (a) Whether the holder has shown good cause for not having
2 made a complete application of the water to a beneficial use;
3 (b) The number of parcels and commercial or residential units
4 which are contained in or planned for the land being developed or
5 the area being served by the county, city, town, public water district
6 or public water company;
7 (c) Any economic conditions which affect the ability of the
8 holder to make a complete application of the water to a beneficial
9 use;
10 (d) Any delays in the development of the land or the area being
11 served by the county, city, town, public water district or public
12 water company which were caused by unanticipated natural
13 conditions; and
14 (e) The period contemplated in the:
15 (1) Plan for the development of a project approved by the
16 local government pursuant to NRS 278.010 to 278.460, inclusive; or

21 to an environmental permit or a temporary permit issued pursuant to
22 NRS 533.436 or 533.504.
23 [6.] 7. For the purposes of this section, the measure of
24 reasonable diligence is the steady application of effort to perfect the
25 application in a reasonably expedient and efficient manner under all
26 the facts and circumstances. When a project or integrated system is
27 composed of several features, work on one feature of the project or
28 system may be considered in finding that reasonable diligence has
29 been shown in the development of water rights for all features of the
30 entire project or system.
31 [7.] 8. The State Engineer shall:
32 (a) Adopt any regulation necessary to carry out the provisions of
33 this section; and

32 and return it to the person who submitted it, together with:
33 (a) An explanation of the deficiency; and
34 (b) A notice stating that the State Engineer will not confirm a
35 report of conveyance that has been rejected unless the report is
36 resubmitted with the material required to cure the deficiency. The
37 notice must also include a statement of the provisions of
38 subsection 5.
39 4. If, from the conveyance documents or other information in
40 the Office of the State Engineer, it appears to the State Engineer that
41 there is a conflict in the chain of title, the State Engineer shall

43 of conveyance and return it to the person who submitted it, together
44 with:

20 without limitation, all advisements and other notices required of the
21 State Engineer and the granting of permits to change the place of
22 diversion, manner of use or place of use of water, until a report of
23 the conveyance is confirmed pursuant to subsection 1.
24 6. If the State Engineer is notified that a court of competent
25 jurisdiction has entered a judgment confirming ownership of a water
26 right or resolving a conflict in a chain of title, and that the judgment
27 has become final, the State Engineer shall take such administrative
28 action as is appropriate or necessary to conform the records of the
29 Office of the State Engineer with the judgment of the court,

5 may, in his or her discretion, grant an extension of time in which to
6 file the instruments. The State Engineer shall approve or deny an
7 application for an extension of time not later than 30 days after
8 the date the application was received by the State Engineer.
9 Sec. 7. NRS 533.400 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 533.400 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [2,] 3,
