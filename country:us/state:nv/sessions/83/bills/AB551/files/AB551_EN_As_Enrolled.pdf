Assembly Bill No. 551–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to background investigations; requiring a
background investigation of employees, prospective
employees, contractors and prospective contractors of
the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the
Department of Health and Human Services and the
Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing state law requires the Department of Health and Human Services,
through the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department, to
administer certain programs of public assistance. (NRS 232.320, 422A.338) Under
existing federal law, any officer or employee of any State who is authorized by
federal law to obtain information from federal tax returns for the purpose of
administering provisions of state or federal law is prohibited from disclosing any
information obtained from those returns. (26 U.S.C. § 6103) As a condition of
receiving such information, federal law requires state officers and employees to
comply with certain safeguards prescribed by the United States Secretary of the
Treasury to ensure the confidentiality of the federal tax returns and the information
contained in those returns. (26 U.S.C. § 6103(p)(4)) Publication 1075 of the United
States Internal Revenue Service: (1) establishes the “Tax Information Security
Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies” to provide guidance to federal,
state and local agencies to ensure that the policies, practices, controls and
safeguards of those agencies adequately protect the confidentiality of federal
taxpayer information; and (2) includes in those Guidelines requirements related to
conducting background investigations of employees and contractors of an agency
that have access to federal taxpayer information.
Assembly Bill No. 530 of the 2019 Session of the Nevada Legislature requires:
(1) the Department of Taxation to conduct a background investigation of each
employee or contractor of the Department upon initial employment or contract and
at least once every 5 years thereafter; and (2) such employees and contractors to
submit to the Department proof of citizenship or eligibility to legally work in the
United States and two complete sets of fingerprints for the purposes of the
background investigation. (NRS 360.142) Sections 1 and 1.5 of this bill enact
identical provisions governing employees and contractors of the Division of
Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human Services
and the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Section 1.8 of
this bill applies certain definitions to section 1.5. Sections 2 and 2.5 of this bill
require: (1) current employees of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services
or the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to submit
information to the Division or the Department, as applicable, for such background
investigations by January 1, 2026; and (2) current contractors of the Division or
Department to submit information to the Division or Department, as applicable, for
such a background investigation when the contract is being renewed.
