AN ACT relating to peace officers; revising the definition of “punitive action” as
the term relates to certain peace officers; prohibiting a law
enforcement agency from denying an increase in seniority or
compensation to a peace officer under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits a law enforcement agency from taking certain types of
2 punitive action against a peace officer; and (2) provides certain protections to peace officers
3 when punitive action may be imposed against them. (NRS 289.020, 289.057, 289.060,
4 289.080, 289.085, 289.092, 289.820, 289.824) Existing law defines “punitive action” as any
5 action which may lead to dismissal, demotion, suspension, reduction in salary, written
6 reprimand or transfer of a peace officer for purposes of punishment. (NRS 289.010) Section 2
7 of this bill revises the definition to include any action which may lead to denial of an increase,
8 either in seniority or compensation, for purposes of punishment.
9 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation of a
10 peace officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer has engaged
11 in activities which could result in punitive action and, subject to certain exceptions,
12 including any investigation which concerns alleged criminal activities, prohibits a law
13 enforcement agency from suspending a peace officer without pay during or pursuant to
14 an investigation until all investigations relating to the matter have concluded. (NRS
15 289.057, 289.090) Section 3 of this bill adds to this prohibition the denial of an increase in
16 seniority or compensation, subject to certain exceptions.

46 otherwise required by federal or state law, keep or make a record of the
47 investigation or the imposition of punitive action after the record is required to be
48 removed from the administrative file.

50 permanently without his or her consent during or pursuant to an investigation
51 conducted pursuant to this section or when there is a hearing relating to such an
