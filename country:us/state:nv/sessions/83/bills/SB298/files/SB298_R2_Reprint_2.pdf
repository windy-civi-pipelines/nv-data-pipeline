AN ACT relating to peace officers; revising the definition of
“punitive action” as the term relates to certain peace
officers; prohibiting a law enforcement agency from
denying an increase in seniority or compensation to a
peace officer under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits a law enforcement agency from taking certain types
2 of punitive action against a peace officer; and (2) provides certain protections to
3 peace officers when punitive action may be imposed against them. (NRS 289.020,
4 289.057, 289.060, 289.080, 289.085, 289.092, 289.820, 289.824) Existing law
5 defines “punitive action” as any action which may lead to dismissal, demotion,
6 suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand or transfer of a peace officer for
7 purposes of punishment. (NRS 289.010) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition
8 to include any action which may lead to denial of an increase, either in seniority or
9 compensation, for purposes of punishment.
10 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation
11 of a peace officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer has
12 engaged in activities which could result in punitive action and, subject to certain
13 exceptions, including any investigation which concerns alleged criminal activities,
14 prohibits a law enforcement agency from suspending a peace officer without pay
15 during or pursuant to an investigation until all investigations relating to the matter
16 have concluded. (NRS 289.057, 289.090) Section 3 of this bill adds to this
17 prohibition the denial of an increase in seniority or compensation, subject to certain
18 exceptions.
