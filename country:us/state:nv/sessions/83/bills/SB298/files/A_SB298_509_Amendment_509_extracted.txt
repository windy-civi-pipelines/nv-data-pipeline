EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [public employment; prohibiting the Government Employee-
Management Relations Board from drawing an inference in favor of or
against a party to a complaint proceeding if the inference is based
solely on the fact that a collective bargaining agreement does not
expressly address the type of act or omission that is the subject of the
complaint;] peace officers; revising the definition of “punitive action”
as the term relates to certain peace officers; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the Government Employee-Management Relations Board to hear
2 and determine complaints arising out of the interpretation of, or performance under, the
3 provisions of chapter 288 of NRS. (NRS 288.110) Section 1 of this bill prohibits the Board
4 from drawing an inference in favor of or against a party to a complaint proceeding if the
5 inference is based solely on the fact that a collective bargaining agreement or similar
6 agreement does not expressly address the type of act or omission that is the subject of the
7 complaint.]
8 Existing law: (1) prohibits a law enforcement agency from taking certain types of
9 punitive action against a peace officer; and (2) provides certain protections to peace officers
10 when punitive action may be imposed against them. (NRS 289.020, 289.057, 289.060,
11 289.080, 289.085, 289.092, 289.820, 289.824) Existing law defines “punitive action” as any
12 action which may lead to dismissal, demotion, suspension, reduction in salary, written
13 reprimand or transfer of a peace officer for purposes of punishment. (NRS 289.010) Section 2
14 of this bill revises the definition to include any action which may lead to denial of an increase,
15 either in seniority or compensation, for purposes of punishment.
