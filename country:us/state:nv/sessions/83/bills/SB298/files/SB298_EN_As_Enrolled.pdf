Senate Bill No. 298–Committee on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to peace officers; revising the definition of
“punitive action” as the term relates to certain peace officers;
prohibiting a law enforcement agency from denying an
increase in seniority or compensation to a peace officer under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) prohibits a law enforcement agency from taking certain types
of punitive action against a peace officer; and (2) provides certain protections to
peace officers when punitive action may be imposed against them. (NRS 289.020,
289.057, 289.060, 289.080, 289.085, 289.092, 289.820, 289.824) Existing law
defines “punitive action” as any action which may lead to dismissal, demotion,
suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand or transfer of a peace officer for
purposes of punishment. (NRS 289.010) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition
to include any action which may lead to denial of an increase, either in seniority or
compensation, for purposes of punishment.
Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation
of a peace officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer has
engaged in activities which could result in punitive action and, subject to certain
exceptions, including any investigation which concerns alleged criminal activities,
prohibits a law enforcement agency from suspending a peace officer without pay
during or pursuant to an investigation until all investigations relating to the matter
have concluded. (NRS 289.057, 289.090) Section 3 of this bill adds to this
prohibition the denial of an increase in seniority or compensation, subject to certain
exceptions.
