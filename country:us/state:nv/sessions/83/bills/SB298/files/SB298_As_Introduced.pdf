EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employment; prohibiting the
Government Employee-Management Relations Board
from drawing an inference in favor of or against a party to
a complaint proceeding if the inference is based solely on
the fact that a collective bargaining agreement does not
expressly address the type of act or omission that is the
subject of the complaint; revising the definition of
“punitive action” as the term relates to certain peace
officers; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Government Employee-Management Relations
2 Board to hear and determine complaints arising out of the interpretation of, or
3 performance under, the provisions of chapter 288 of NRS. (NRS 288.110) Section
4 1 of this bill prohibits the Board from drawing an inference in favor of or against a
5 party to a complaint proceeding if the inference is based solely on the fact that a
6 collective bargaining agreement or similar agreement does not expressly address
7 the type of act or omission that is the subject of the complaint.
8 Existing law: (1) prohibits a law enforcement agency from taking certain types
9 of punitive action against a peace officer; and (2) provides certain protections to
10 peace officers when punitive action may be imposed against them. (NRS 289.020,
11 289.057, 289.060, 289.080, 289.085, 289.092, 289.820, 289.824) Existing law
12 defines “punitive action” as any action which may lead to dismissal, demotion,
13 suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand or transfer of a peace officer for
14 purposes of punishment. (NRS 289.010) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition
15 to include any action which may lead to denial of an increase, either in seniority or
16 compensation, for purposes of punishment.
