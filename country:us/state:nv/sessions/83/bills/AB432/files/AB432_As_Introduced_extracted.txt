18 and 24 of this bill reorganize provisions that authorize certain state agencies and
19 local governmental agencies to use the equipment and services of the Office.
20 Section 9 of this bill revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to
21 include the board of trustees of a school district, which has the effect of authorizing
22 the board of trustees of a school district to use the services of the Office pursuant to

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; creating and

the Office of the Governor; authorizing the Chief
Information Officer to apply for and accept federal grants
for purposes of supporting the Security Operations

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that the Office of the Chief Information Officer within

3 Client Services Unit; (3) the Computing Services Unit; (4) the Network Services
4 Unit, including a Network Transportation Services Group and a
5 Telecommunications Group; (5) the Office of Information Security; and (6) certain
6 other units, groups, divisions or departments deemed necessary by the Chief
7 Information Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 12 of this bill creates the Security
8 Operations Center in the Office of the Chief Information Officer.
9 Existing law: (1) requires the Office to provide certain state agencies and
10 elected officers with all their required design of information systems; (2) authorizes
11 certain other state agencies to negotiate with the Office for its services or the use of
12 its equipment; and (3) authorizes, upon request, the Office to provide certain
-
*AB432*

– 2 –
13 services to state agencies not under the control of the Governor and local
14 governmental agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141) Section 15 of this bill requires the
15 Security Operations Center to provide certain state agencies and elected officers
16 with cybersecurity services, including real-time monitoring of cyberinfrastructure,
17 threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity enforcement. Sections 15
18 and 24 of this bill reorganize provisions that authorize certain state agencies and
19 local governmental agencies to use the equipment and services of the Office.
20 Section 9 of this bill revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to
21 include the board of trustees of a school district, which has the effect of authorizing
22 the board of trustees of a school district to use the services of the Office pursuant to
23 section 15. Section 10 of this bill amends the definition of “using agency” so that
24 the term includes any state agency, state officer or local governmental agency that
25 uses the services and equipment of the Office.
26 Section 2 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to develop certain
27 policies and procedures to: (1) combat the increasing threats to using agencies
28 posed by cybercriminals; (2) protect sensitive data in the possession of a using

30 incident that affects a using agency.
31 Section 3 of this bill provides that if a using agency does not comply with the
32 cybersecurity policies and protocols developed by the Security Operations Center,
33 the Chief may: (1) impose additional oversight or audit requirements on the using
34 agency relating to cybersecurity; (2) restrict the using agency’s access to the

36 the using agency an additional amount for the using agency’s continued use of the
37 equipment and services of the Office.

45 Section 6 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to submit an
46 annual report to the Governor, Attorney General and the Director of the Legislative
47 Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislature that includes certain
48 information relating to the duties of the Security Operations Center.
49 Section 7 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center, in collaboration
50 with the Nevada System of Higher Education, to develop the Cybersecurity Talent
51 Pipeline Program.
52 Section 8 of this bill amends the definition of “information service,” as
53 provided by the Office to a using agency, to include the real-time monitoring of
54 cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity
55 enforcement.
56 Existing law makes certain legislative determinations and declarations relating
57 to the creation and purpose of the Office. (NRS 242.071) Section 11 of this bill
58 revises these determinations and declarations to include performing information
59 services for using agencies and to eliminate the limitation on the Office providing
60 administrative control of the informational systems of using agencies.
61 Existing law provides that certain documents relating to homeland security that
62 are assembled, maintained, overseen or prepared by the Office to mitigate, prevent
63 or respond to acts of terrorism are confidential. (NRS 242.105) Section 13 of this
64 bill provides that certain documents relating to the cybersecurity of a using agency
65 are also confidential.
66 Existing law requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to
67 information systems of certain state agencies. (NRS 242.111) Section 14 of this bill
-

– 3 –
68 instead requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to information
69 systems of using agencies.
70 Existing law requires the Chief to advise using agencies regarding the policy
71 for information services of the Executive Branch of Government. (NRS 242.151)
72 Section 16 of this bill instead requires the Chief to advise the using agencies of the
73 policy for information services of the Office.
74 Existing law provides that all equipment of an agency or elected state officer
75 which is owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the
76 Office. (NRS 242.161) Section 17 of this bill provides instead that all equipment of
77 a using agency which is owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial
78 control of the Office.
79 Section 18 of this bill provides that the Office is responsible for any application
80 of an information system which it furnishes to using agencies.
81 Section 19 of this bill requires: (1) any using agency which uses the equipment
82 or services of the Office to adhere to the regulations, standards, practices, policies
83 and conventions of the Office; and (2) each using agency to report certain suspected
84 incidents to the Security Operations Center.
85 Existing law requires the Chief to investigate and resolve any breach of an
86 information system of a state agency or elected officer that uses the equipment or
87 services of the Office. (NRS 242.183) Section 20 of this bill requires instead that
88 the Chief, in consultation with the Security Operations Center, investigate and
89 resolve any breach of an information system of using agency.
90 Existing law provides that the amount receivable from a state agency or officer
91 or local governmental agency which uses the service of the Office must be
92 determined by the Chief. (NRS 242.191) Section 21 of this bill provides instead
93 that the amount receivable from a using agency which uses the services or
94 equipment of the Office must be determined by the Chief and that the amount will
95 include the annual expenses of the cybersecurity services provided by the Security
96 Operations Center.
97 Section 22 of this bill requires each using agency using the services and
98 equipment of the Office to pay a fee to the Fund for Information Services.
