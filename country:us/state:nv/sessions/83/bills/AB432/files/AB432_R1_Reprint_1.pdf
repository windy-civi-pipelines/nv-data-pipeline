20 Section 15 also requires any local governmental agency which has agreed to use
21 the equipment and services of the Office to apply to the Chief to withdraw from the
22 use. Section 9 of this bill revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to

24 the board of trustees of a school district to use the services of the Office pursuant to
25 section 15. Section 10 of this bill amends the definition of “using agency” so that
26 the term includes any state agency, state officer or local governmental agency that
