7 Security Operations Center in the Office of the Chief Information Officer.
8 Existing law: (1) requires the Office to provide certain state agencies and elected officers
9 with all their required design of information systems; (2) authorizes certain other state
10 agencies to negotiate with the Office for its services or the use of its equipment; and (3)

13 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to provide certain state agencies and
14 elected officers with cybersecurity services, including real-time monitoring of
15 cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity enforcement.
16 Sections 15 and 24 of this bill reorganize provisions that authorize certain state agencies and
17 local governmental agencies to use the equipment and services of the Office. Section 15 also

Assembly Amendment No. 281 to Assembly Bill No. 432 Page 4
18 requires any local governmental agency which has agreed to use the equipment and
19 services of the Office to apply to the Chief to withdraw from the use. Section 9 of this bill
20 revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to include the board of trustees of a
21 school district, which has the effect of authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
22 use the services of the Office pursuant to section 15. Section 10 of this bill amends the
23 definition of “using agency” so that the term includes any state agency, state officer or local
24 governmental agency that uses the services and equipment of the Office.
25 Section 2 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to develop certain policies
26 and procedures to: (1) combat the increasing threats to using agencies posed by
27 cybercriminals; (2) protect sensitive data in the possession of a using agency; and (3) ensure a
28 coordinated and rapid response to any cybersecurity incident that affects a using agency.
29 Section 3 of this bill provides that if a using agency does not comply with the
30 cybersecurity policies and protocols developed by the Security Operations Center, the Chief

40 grant funds for the purposes of cybersecurity support and infrastructure development.
41 Section 5 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to collaborate with the
42 Nevada Office of Cyber Defense Coordination to enhance communication and coordination of

50 federally recognized American Indian tribe and that any interlocal agreement entered
51 into must respect the sovereign governance of the tribe and provide for jointly agreed
52 data protocols.
53 To the extent that funding is available, section 7 of this bill requires the Security
54 Operations Center, in collaboration with the Nevada System of Higher Education, to develop
55 the Cybersecurity Talent Pipeline Program.

96 governmental agency which uses the service of the Office must be determined by the Chief.
