AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring that certain policies of
health insurance include coverage for certain health care
to treat and care for diseases and conditions caused by
severe obesity; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172-
3 422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875,
5 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-
6 695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for
7 health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
8 employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555)
9 Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require that certain public and private
10 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include
11 medically necessary treatment and care, including bariatric surgery, for diseases
12 and conditions caused by severe obesity under certain circumstances and with
13 certain restrictions. Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 exclude from this required
14 coverage drugs for weight loss. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner
15 of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic
16 insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage required by
17 section 1. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke
18 the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
20 such actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements
21 of sections 1, 3-7, 9 and 11. (NRS 680A.200) Section 12 of this bill requires the

23 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 399–ASSEMBLYMEMBER EDGEWORTH
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Requires certain health insurance to cover certain
health care related to severe obesity. (BDR 57-657)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 13)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring that certain policies of
health insurance include coverage for certain health care
to treat and care for diseases and conditions caused by
severe obesity; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172-
3 422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875,
5 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-
6 695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for
7 health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
8 employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555)
9 Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require that certain public and private
10 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include
11 medically necessary treatment and care, including bariatric surgery, for diseases
12 and conditions caused by severe obesity under certain circumstances and with
13 certain restrictions. Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 exclude from this required
14 coverage drugs for weight loss. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner
15 of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic
16 insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage required by
17 section 1. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke
18 the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
20 such actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements
21 of sections 1, 3-7, 9 and 11. (NRS 680A.200) Section 12 of this bill requires the
-

23 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
