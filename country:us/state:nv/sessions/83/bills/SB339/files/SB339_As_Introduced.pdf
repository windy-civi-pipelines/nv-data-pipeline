Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the executive board of the unit-owners’ association of a
2 common-interest community to cause the annual review or audit of the financial
3 statements of the association. (NRS 116.31144) Section 2 of this bill requires the
4 Real Estate Division of the Department of Business and Industry to investigate and
5 audit all financial accounts related to an association if the Division has reasonable
6 cause to believe that the accounts or records of the association have not been
7 maintained and that the investigation and audit is reasonably necessary to
8 administer or enforce certain laws under the jurisdiction of the Division.
9 Existing law establishes procedures related to the election or appointment of a
10 member of the executive board. (NRS 116.31034) Section 3 of this bill requires
11 candidates for membership on the executive board to undergo a background
12 investigation conducted by the Division. Section 6 of this bill requires the
13 candidate to submit a copy of the background investigation to the association for
14 distribution to the units’ owners during the election process or in a subsequent

16 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to establish a training program for
17 members of executive boards and requires members to take the training within 6
18 months after their election or appointment.
19 Existing law requires the association to establish adequate reserves for the
20 repair, replacement and restoration of the major components of the common
21 elements and any other portion of the common-interest community that the
22 association is obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore. (NRS 116.3115)
23 Existing law requires the executive board to: (1) cause a study of the reserves to be
24 conducted every 5 years; (2) annually review the results of the study; and (3) make
25 adjustments to the funding plan of the association. (NRS 116.31152) Section 7 of
26 this bill requires the study to be conducted every year and establishes the standards
27 for determining the sufficiency of funds in the reserves of the association.
28 Existing law provides that before commencing a civil action relating to the
29 interpretation, application or enforcement of any covenants, conditions or
30 restrictions applicable to residential property or any bylaws, rules or regulations
31 adopted by an association or the procedures used for increasing, decreasing or
32 imposing additional assessments upon residential property, a dispute must first be
33 submitted to mediation or, if the parties agree, referred to a program established by
34 the Division for resolution of the dispute. (NRS 38.310) Section 9 of this bill
35 exempts actions brought for damages from a failure or refusal to comply with
36 certain provisions of law related to common-interest communities or the
37 declarations or bylaws of an association from such mandatory mediation or such a
38 program for resolution. Instead, sections 8 and 10 of this bill require such actions
39 to be commenced in justice court and adjudicated as small claims.
40 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the applicability of
41 certain provisions to sections 2-4.
