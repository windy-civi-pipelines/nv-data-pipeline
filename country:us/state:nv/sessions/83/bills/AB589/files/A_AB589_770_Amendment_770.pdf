Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various programs to provide benefits and services to persons
2 with autism spectrum disorders. (NRS 62B.700, 388.449, 391A.250-391A.270, 422.27497,
3 427A.871-427A.8803, chapter 435 of NRS) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish protections for
4 the privacy of autism-related data maintained by state agencies, local governments and
5 contractors and grantees thereof. Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2 establishes
6 the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 prohibits a state agency, local government or
7 contractor or grantee thereof acting within the scope of the contract or grant from collecting
8 autism-related data except for certain purposes relating to: (1) the provision of benefits or
9 services to persons who have or are suspected of having autism spectrum disorders; and (2)
10 compliance with , or ensuring compliance with, applicable law. Section 7 prohibits a state
11 agency or local government from disclosing autism-related data to outside persons or entities
12 except: (1) with the informed consent of the person to whom the autism-related data pertains
13 or his or her legal guardian; (2) to comply with certain legal requirements; or (3) where
14 necessary to provide services or supports to the person to whom the autism-related data

Assembly Amendment No. 770 to Assembly Bill No. 589 Page 4
15 pertains. Section 7 prohibits a contractor or grantee of a state agency or local government
16 from disclosing autism-related data obtained from the state agency or local government or
17 obtained within the scope of the contract or grant except in those authorized circumstances.
18 Section 9 makes a conforming change to indicate that autism-related data in the possession of
19 a state agency, local government or contractor or grantee thereof is not a public record.
20 Section 8 requires the Office of the Governor to perform a biennial review of compliance by
21 the Executive Department of State Government and the contractors and grantees thereof with
22 the requirements of sections 6 and 7. Section 8 also authorizes the Director of the Department
23 of Health and Human Services to appoint time-limited advisory groups to evaluate and
24 provide recommendations concerning the implementation of sections 2-8.
25 Except where the person to whom genetic information pertains or his or her legal
26 guardian provides informed consent or in certain other circumstances, existing law makes it a
27 misdemeanor to obtain, retain or disclose genetic information obtained from a genetic test
28 conducted to determine the presence of certain abnormalities or deficiencies. (NRS 629.101-
29 629.201) Section 14 of this bill broadens the information to which those provisions apply to
30 include information obtained from any test to derive and interpret data related to the genetic
31 characteristics of a person. Sections 16 and 17 of this bill additionally make it a misdemeanor
32 to obtain or retain a DNA sample under circumstances where it is currently a misdemeanor to
33 obtain or retain genetic information. Sections 18 and 20 of this bill make the unauthorized
34 disclosure of the identity of a person who was the subject of a genetic test or of genetic
35 information a category E felony. Section 18 additionally makes it a category E felony to
36 intentionally submit the DNA sample of another person for a genetic test or perform or cause
37 the performance of a genetic test on the DNA sample of another person without the informed
38 consent of that person or his or her legal guardian, except in certain circumstances. Section 21
39 of this bill authorizes a person injured by such unauthorized genetic testing to bring a civil
40 action. Section 12 of this bill newly establishes a category D felony for intentionally selling or
41 otherwise transferring the DNA sample or genetic information of a person to another person
42 or entity without the informed consent of the person from whom the sample was taken or to
43 whom the genetic information pertains, as applicable, or his or her legal guardian, except in
44 certain circumstances. Section 11 of this bill defines the term “DNA sample,” and section 13
45 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition and certain existing definitions.
46 Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the applicability of sections 11
47 and 12. Section 19 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
48 establishing procedures for obtaining informed consent where required by sections 12 and 16-
49 18.
