3 391A.270, 422.27497, 427A.871-427A.8803, chapter 435 of NRS) Sections 2-9

5 by state agencies, local governments and contractors and grantees thereof.

*AB589*
– 2 –
6 Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2 establishes the applicability of
7 those definitions. Section 6 prohibits a state agency, local government or contractor
8 or grantee thereof acting within the scope of the contract or grant from collecting
9 autism-related data except for certain purposes relating to: (1) the provision of
10 benefits or services to persons who have or are suspected of having autism
11 spectrum disorders; and (2) compliance with applicable law. Section 7 prohibits a
12 state agency or local government from disclosing autism-related data to outside
13 persons or entities except: (1) with the informed consent of the person to whom the
14 autism-related data pertains or his or her legal guardian; (2) to comply with certain
15 legal requirements; or (3) where necessary to provide services or supports to the
16 person to whom the autism-related data pertains. Section 7 prohibits a contractor or
17 grantee of a state agency or local government from disclosing autism-related data
18 obtained from the state agency or local government or obtained within the scope of
19 the contract or grant except in those authorized circumstances. Section 9 makes a
20 conforming change to indicate that autism-related data in the possession of a state
21 agency, local government or contractor or grantee thereof is not a public record.
22 Section 8 requires the Office of the Governor to perform a biennial review of
23 compliance by the Executive Department of State Government and the contractors
24 and grantees thereof with the requirements of sections 6 and 7. Section 8 also
25 authorizes the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to appoint
26 time-limited advisory groups to evaluate and provide recommendations concerning
27 the implementation of sections 2-8.
28 Except where the person to whom genetic information pertains or his or her
29 legal guardian provides informed consent or in certain other circumstances, existing
30 law makes it a misdemeanor to obtain, retain or disclose genetic information
31 obtained from a genetic test conducted to determine the presence of certain
32 abnormalities or deficiencies. (NRS 629.101-629.201) Section 14 of this bill
33 broadens the information to which those provisions apply to include information
34 obtained from any test to derive and interpret data related to the genetic
35 characteristics of a person. Sections 16 and 17 of this bill additionally make it a
36 misdemeanor to obtain or retain a DNA sample under circumstances where it is
37 currently a misdemeanor to obtain or retain genetic information. Sections 18 and
38 20 of this bill make the unauthorized disclosure of the identity of a person who was
39 the subject of a genetic test or of genetic information a category E felony. Section
40 18 additionally makes it a category E felony to intentionally submit the DNA
41 sample of another person for a genetic test or perform or cause the performance of a
42 genetic test on the DNA sample of another person without the informed consent of
43 that person or his or her legal guardian, except in certain circumstances. Section 21
44 of this bill authorizes a person injured by such unauthorized genetic testing to bring
45 a civil action. Section 12 of this bill newly establishes a category D felony for
46 intentionally selling or otherwise transferring the DNA sample or genetic
47 information of a person to another person or entity without the informed consent of
48 the person from whom the sample was taken or to whom the genetic information
49 pertains, as applicable, or his or her legal guardian, except in certain circumstances.
50 Section 11 of this bill defines the term “DNA sample,” and section 13 of this bill
51 establishes the applicability of that definition and certain existing definitions.
52 Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the applicability of
53 sections 11 and 12. Section 19 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to
54 adopt regulations establishing procedures for obtaining informed consent where
55 required by sections 12 and 16-18.

AN ACT relating to privacy; prohibiting a state agency, a local
government or a contractor or grantee of a state agency or
local government from collecting or disclosing autism-
related data under certain circumstances; requiring the
Office of the Governor to biennially review compliance
with those prohibitions; authorizing the establishment of

concerning the implementation of those prohibitions;
prohibiting the obtaining, retention, sale or transfer of
certain genetic information or a DNA sample except
in certain circumstances; prohibiting the disclosure of
certain genetic information or related information except
in certain circumstances; prohibiting certain genetic
testing except in certain circumstances; creating a cause
of action for certain unauthorized disclosures of genetic
information and certain unauthorized genetic testing;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various programs to provide benefits and services to
2 persons with autism spectrum disorders. (NRS 62B.700, 388.449, 391A.250-
3 391A.270, 422.27497, 427A.871-427A.8803, chapter 435 of NRS) Sections 2-9
4 of this bill establish protections for the privacy of autism-related data maintained
5 by state agencies, local governments and contractors and grantees thereof.
-
*AB589*

– 2 –
6 Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2 establishes the applicability of
7 those definitions. Section 6 prohibits a state agency, local government or contractor
8 or grantee thereof acting within the scope of the contract or grant from collecting
9 autism-related data except for certain purposes relating to: (1) the provision of
10 benefits or services to persons who have or are suspected of having autism
11 spectrum disorders; and (2) compliance with applicable law. Section 7 prohibits a
12 state agency or local government from disclosing autism-related data to outside
13 persons or entities except: (1) with the informed consent of the person to whom the
14 autism-related data pertains or his or her legal guardian; (2) to comply with certain
15 legal requirements; or (3) where necessary to provide services or supports to the
16 person to whom the autism-related data pertains. Section 7 prohibits a contractor or
17 grantee of a state agency or local government from disclosing autism-related data
18 obtained from the state agency or local government or obtained within the scope of
19 the contract or grant except in those authorized circumstances. Section 9 makes a
20 conforming change to indicate that autism-related data in the possession of a state
21 agency, local government or contractor or grantee thereof is not a public record.
22 Section 8 requires the Office of the Governor to perform a biennial review of
23 compliance by the Executive Department of State Government and the contractors
24 and grantees thereof with the requirements of sections 6 and 7. Section 8 also
25 authorizes the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to appoint
26 time-limited advisory groups to evaluate and provide recommendations concerning
27 the implementation of sections 2-8.
28 Except where the person to whom genetic information pertains or his or her
29 legal guardian provides informed consent or in certain other circumstances, existing
30 law makes it a misdemeanor to obtain, retain or disclose genetic information
31 obtained from a genetic test conducted to determine the presence of certain
32 abnormalities or deficiencies. (NRS 629.101-629.201) Section 14 of this bill
33 broadens the information to which those provisions apply to include information
34 obtained from any test to derive and interpret data related to the genetic
35 characteristics of a person. Sections 16 and 17 of this bill additionally make it a
36 misdemeanor to obtain or retain a DNA sample under circumstances where it is
37 currently a misdemeanor to obtain or retain genetic information. Sections 18 and
38 20 of this bill make the unauthorized disclosure of the identity of a person who was
39 the subject of a genetic test or of genetic information a category E felony. Section
40 18 additionally makes it a category E felony to intentionally submit the DNA
41 sample of another person for a genetic test or perform or cause the performance of a
42 genetic test on the DNA sample of another person without the informed consent of
43 that person or his or her legal guardian, except in certain circumstances. Section 21
44 of this bill authorizes a person injured by such unauthorized genetic testing to bring
45 a civil action. Section 12 of this bill newly establishes a category D felony for
46 intentionally selling or otherwise transferring the DNA sample or genetic
47 information of a person to another person or entity without the informed consent of
48 the person from whom the sample was taken or to whom the genetic information
49 pertains, as applicable, or his or her legal guardian, except in certain circumstances.
50 Section 11 of this bill defines the term “DNA sample,” and section 13 of this bill
51 establishes the applicability of that definition and certain existing definitions.
52 Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the applicability of
53 sections 11 and 12. Section 19 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to
54 adopt regulations establishing procedures for obtaining informed consent where
55 required by sections 12 and 16-18.
