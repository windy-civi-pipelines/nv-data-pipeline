5 rescue organization that handles pets or a commercial establishment engaged in the business

7 by the governing body. Sections 1 and 2 also require the ordinance adopted by the governing
8 body of the county or incorporated city to prescribe the manner in which a kennel, an animal
9 rescue organization that handles pets or a commercial establishment engaged in the business
10 of handling [animals:] pets: (1) completes the required training course on handling [animals;]
11 pets; and (2) renews the training biennially. Sections 1 and 2 define the term “pet” to mean
