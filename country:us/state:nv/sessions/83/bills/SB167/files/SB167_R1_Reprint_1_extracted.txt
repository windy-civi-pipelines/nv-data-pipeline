AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting the importation and
sale of household cleaning products for which animal
testing was performed; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill prohibits, under certain circumstances, a manufacturer from importing,
2 selling or offering for sale in this State any household cleaning product for which
3 animal testing was performed on or after January 1, 2030. This bill provides
4 exceptions from that prohibition for animal testing that is performed: (1) to comply
5 with a requirement, notification or registration of a regulatory agency of a foreign
6 jurisdiction; (2) because of certain considerations relating to the existence or
7 practicality of certain testing methodologies; (3) for certain assessments; or (4) to
8 comply with a federal or state law. This bill additionally provides that the
9 prohibition does not apply to: (1) a household cleaning product or ingredient in a
10 household cleaning product if animal testing was conducted for the household
11 cleaning product or ingredient before January 1, 2030; (2) data from certain animal
12 testing of certain ingredients; or (3) a manufacturer that requests from a supplier but
13 is unable to obtain verification that an ingredient has not been subject to animal
14 testing.
15 Existing law defines various activities that constitute deceptive trade practices
16 and provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
17 engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) This bill makes it a
18 deceptive practice to violate the provisions of this bill.

1 Section 1. Chapter 598 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a
4 manufacturer shall not import for profit, sell or offer for sale in
5 this State any household cleaning product for which the
6 manufacturer knew or reasonably should have known that animal
7 testing was conducted or contracted by or on behalf of the
8 manufacturer or any supplier of the manufacturer if the animal
9 testing was conducted on or after January 1, 2030.
10 2. The prohibition in subsection 1 does not apply to animal
11 testing, or data derived therefrom, that is conducted:
12 (a) To comply with a federal or state law, including, without
13 limitation, requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15
14 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. or guidelines issued pursuant to that Act.
15 (b) Because no appropriate non-animal testing methods exist
16 or the existing non-animal testing methods cannot be reasonably
17 conducted.
18 (c) To enable a comprehensive safety assessment for which
19 animal testing is necessary even after the integration and
20 evaluation of all relevant existing data, including, without

25 (a) A household cleaning product or ingredient in a household
26 cleaning product if animal testing was conducted for the
27 household cleaning product or ingredient before January 1, 2030,
28 even if the household cleaning product in its final form or
29 ingredient was manufactured on or after that date.
30 (b) Data from animal testing of an ingredient that is a
31 commodity produced in large quantities and is used as a raw
32 material for end uses outside of cleaning products, so long as the
33 animal testing on the ingredient was not conducted predominately
34 for the purpose of assessing the use of the ingredient in a
35 household cleaning product.
36 (c) An ingredient a manufacturer obtained from a supplier for
37 which:
38 (1) The manufacturer requested verification from the
39 supplier that the ingredient has not been subject to animal testing;
40 and
41 (2) The supplier is unable to provide such verification due
42 to a lack of access to the necessary data.

1 4. This section shall not be construed to prevent a
2 manufacturer or supplier from reviewing, assessing or retaining

6 practice for the purposes of NRS 598.0903 to 598.0999, inclusive.

8 (a) “Animal testing” means any process or procedure that uses
9 a live, nonhuman vertebrate or cephalopod to obtain information
10 on the characteristics of a household cleaning product or any
11 ingredient thereof and which generates information regarding the
12 ability of a household cleaning product or ingredient to produce a
13 specific biological effect under specified conditions.
14 (b) “Household cleaning product” means any product
15 manufactured from chemicals that is designed to clean or provide
16 protection to household surfaces or furniture, including, without

26 Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 136 et seq.
27 (d) “Manufacturer” means a person who imports, produces or
28 manufactures a household cleaning product and whose name

30 (e) “Non-animal testing” means any process or procedure that

35 or ingredient to produce a specific biological effect under specified
36 conditions.

38 ingredient to a manufacturer for the formulation of a household
