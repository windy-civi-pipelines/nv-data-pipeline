Senate Bill No. 167–Senators Scheible; and Krasner
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting the importation and
sale of household cleaning products for which animal testing
was performed; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
This bill prohibits, under certain circumstances, a manufacturer from importing,
selling or offering for sale in this State any household cleaning product for which
animal testing was performed on or after January 1, 2030. This bill provides
exceptions from that prohibition for animal testing that is performed: (1) to comply
with a requirement, notification or registration of a regulatory agency of a foreign
jurisdiction; (2) because of certain considerations relating to the existence or
practicality of certain testing methodologies; (3) for certain assessments; or (4) to
comply with a federal or state law. This bill additionally provides that the
prohibition does not apply to: (1) a household cleaning product or ingredient in a
household cleaning product if animal testing was conducted for the household
cleaning product or ingredient before January 1, 2030; (2) data from certain animal
testing of certain ingredients; or (3) a manufacturer that requests from a supplier but
is unable to obtain verification that an ingredient has not been subject to animal
testing.
Existing law defines various activities that constitute deceptive trade practices
and provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) This bill makes it a
deceptive practice to violate the provisions of this bill.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Chapter 598 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
thereto a new section to read as follows:
1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a
manufacturer shall not import for profit, sell or offer for sale in
this State any household cleaning product for which the
manufacturer knew or reasonably should have known that animal
testing was conducted or contracted by or on behalf of the
manufacturer or any supplier of the manufacturer if the animal
testing was conducted on or after January 1, 2030.
2. The prohibition in subsection 1 does not apply to animal
testing, or data derived therefrom, that is conducted:
(a) To comply with a federal or state law, including, without
limitation, requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15
U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq. or guidelines issued pursuant to that Act.

(b) Because no appropriate non-animal testing methods exist
or the existing non-animal testing methods cannot be reasonably
conducted.
(c) To enable a comprehensive safety assessment for which
animal testing is necessary even after the integration and
evaluation of all relevant existing data, including, without
limitation, data from animal and non-animal testing.
(d) To comply with a requirement, notification or registration
of a regulatory agency of a foreign jurisdiction.
3. The provisions of this section do not apply to:
(a) A household cleaning product or ingredient in a household
cleaning product if animal testing was conducted for the
household cleaning product or ingredient before January 1, 2030,
even if the household cleaning product in its final form or
ingredient was manufactured on or after that date.
(b) Data from animal testing of an ingredient that is a
commodity produced in large quantities and is used as a raw
material for end uses outside of cleaning products, so long as the
animal testing on the ingredient was not conducted predominately
for the purpose of assessing the use of the ingredient in a
household cleaning product.
(c) An ingredient a manufacturer obtained from a supplier for
which:
(1) The manufacturer requested verification from the
supplier that the ingredient has not been subject to animal testing;
and
(2) The supplier is unable to provide such verification due
to a lack of access to the necessary data.
4. This section shall not be construed to prevent a
manufacturer or supplier from reviewing, assessing or retaining
existing data from animal testing, including, without limitation,
data sourced from a consortia or nonprofit organization.
5. A violation of this section constitutes a deceptive trade
practice for the purposes of NRS 598.0903 to 598.0999, inclusive.
6. As used in this section:
(a) “Animal testing” means any process or procedure that uses
a live, nonhuman vertebrate or cephalopod to obtain information
on the characteristics of a household cleaning product or any
ingredient thereof and which generates information regarding the
ability of a household cleaning product or ingredient to produce a
specific biological effect under specified conditions.
(b) “Household cleaning product” means any product
manufactured from chemicals that is designed to clean or provide

(d) “Manufacturer” means a person who imports, produces or

(e) “Non-animal testing” means any process or procedure that
does not use a live, nonhuman vertebrate or cephalopod to obtain
information on the characteristics of a household cleaning
product or any ingredient thereof and which generates
information regarding the ability of a household cleaning product
or ingredient to produce a specific biological effect under specified
conditions.
(f) “Supplier” means any entity that directly provides an
ingredient to a manufacturer for the formulation of a household
cleaning product.
