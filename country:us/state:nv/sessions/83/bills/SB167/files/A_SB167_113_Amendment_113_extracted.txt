AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting the importation and sale of
household cleaning products for which animal testing was performed;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill prohibits, under certain circumstances, a manufacturer from importing, selling or
2 offering for sale in this State any household cleaning product for which animal testing was
3 performed on or after January 1, 2030. This bill provides exceptions from that prohibition for
4 animal testing that is performed : (1) to comply with a requirement , notification or
5 registration of a regulatory agency of a foreign jurisdiction ; (2) because of certain
6 considerations relating to the existence or practicality of certain testing methodologies;
7 (3) for certain assessments; or [, under certain circumstances,] (4) to comply with a
8 [requirement of a] federal or state [regulatory agency.] law. This bill additionally provides
9 that the prohibition does not apply to: (1) a household cleaning product or ingredient in a
10 household cleaning product if animal testing was conducted for the household cleaning
11 product or ingredient before January 1, 2030; (2) data from certain animal testing of
12 certain ingredients; or [(2)] (3) a manufacturer that [reviews, assesses or retains data
13 obtained from] requests from a supplier but is unable to obtain verification that an
14 ingredient has not been subject to animal testing.
15 Existing law defines various activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
16 provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who engage in
17 deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) This bill makes it a deceptive practice to
18 violate the provisions of this bill.

15 cleaning product which is tested is in wide use and cannot be replaced by another
16 ingredient which is capable of performing a similar function;
17 (2) A specific human health problem relating to the household cleaning
18 product or ingredient is substantiated and the need to conduct animal testing is
19 justified and supported by a detailed protocol for research that is proposed as the
20 basis for the evaluation of the household cleaning product or ingredient; and
21 (3) There does not exist a method of testing other than animal testing
22 that is accepted for the relevant purpose by the federal or state regulatory agency;
23 or]
24 (b) Because no appropriate non-animal testing methods exist or the existing

30 regulatory agency of a foreign jurisdiction.

35 final form or ingredient was manufactured on or after that date . [; or]
36 (b) [A manufacturer that reviews, assesses or retains data obtained from
37 animal testing.] Data from animal testing of an ingredient that is a commodity
38 produced in large quantities and is used as a raw material for end uses outside of
39 cleaning products, so long as the animal testing on the ingredient was not
40 conducted predominately for the purpose of assessing the use of the ingredient in
41 a household cleaning product.
42 (c) An ingredient a manufacturer obtained from a supplier for which:
43 (1) The manufacturer requested verification from the supplier that the
44 ingredient has not been subject to animal testing; and

46 access to the necessary data.
