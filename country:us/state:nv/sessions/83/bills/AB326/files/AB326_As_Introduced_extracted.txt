EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the State Board of Health
to adopt regulations establishing the designation of
centers for the treatment of trauma as level I, II, III or IV;
authorizing the State Board to adopt regulations
establishing additional designations; requiring approval
before a center for the treatment of trauma increases its
designated level; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that before operating a center for the treatment of trauma,
2 a hospital must obtain the approval of the Administrator of the Division of Public
3 and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, if the
4 hospital is located in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
5 Clark County), the district board of health. (NRS 450B.236, 450B.237) Existing
6 law also requires the Administrator to verify that a hospital meets certain standards
7 and complete a comprehensive assessment of needs before approving a proposal to
8 designate a hospital as a center for the treatment of trauma. (NRS 450B.237)
9 Existing regulations authorize the Administrator to designate a center for the
10 treatment of trauma as level I, II or III. (NAC 450B.780-450B.875) Section 2 of
11 this bill incorporates those designations into existing law and additionally
12 authorizes the designation of a critical access hospital as a level IV center for the
13 treatment of trauma. Section 2 additionally requires a hospital that wishes to
14 increase the level of treatment provided by an existing center for the treatment of
15 trauma to submit to a similar application and approval process as a hospital

19 unless the center has been designated by the Administrator to provide that level of
20 treatment.
