EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; [requiring the Department of Health and Human
Services to conduct a study on the treatment of trauma in this State;]
prohibiting a center for the treatment of trauma from representing
it provides a specific level of care unless the center provides that
level of care; authorizing the State Board of Health to adopt
regulations establishing specific designations for the level of care
provided by a center for the treatment of trauma; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that before operating a center for the treatment of trauma, a hospital
2 must obtain the approval of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health
3 of the Department of Health and Human Services and, if the hospital is located in a county
4 whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the district board of
5 health. (NRS 450B.236, 450B.237) Existing law also requires the Administrator to verify that
6 a hospital meets certain standards and complete a comprehensive assessment of needs before
7 approving a proposal to designate a hospital as a center for the treatment of trauma. (NRS
8 450B.237) Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
9 establishing the standards for the designation of hospitals as centers for the treatment of
10 trauma. (NRS 450B.237) Existing regulations authorize the Administrator to designate a
11 center for the treatment of trauma as level I, II or III. (NAC 450B.780-450B.875) [Section 3.5
12 of this bill requires: (1) the Department of Health and Human Services to study during the
13 2025-2026 interim the current system for the treatment of trauma in this State and the future
14 needs of this State relating to the treatment of trauma; (2) the study to include the solicitation
15 of public comment on the subject matter of the study; and (3) the Department to publish a
16 report of the study on the Internet and submit the report to the Governor and the Legislature.]
17 Section 5 of this bill provides explicit statutory authorization for the State Board of
18 Health to adopt regulations establishing specific levels of trauma care that a hospital
19 may be designated to provide, including regulations that allow the designation of a

Assembly Amendment No. 856 to Assembly Bill No. 326 First Reprint Page 4
20 critical access hospital that meets certain requirements as a level IV center for the
21 treatment of trauma. Section 4 of this bill prohibits the operator of a center for the
22 treatment of trauma from representing that the center for the treatment of trauma
23 provides a specific level of treatment unless the center has been designated by the
24 Administrator to provide that level of treatment.
