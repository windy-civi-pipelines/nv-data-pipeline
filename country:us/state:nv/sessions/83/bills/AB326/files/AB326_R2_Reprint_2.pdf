5 Clark County), the district board of health. (NRS 450B.236, 450B.237) Existing
6 law also requires the Administrator to verify that a hospital meets certain standards
7 and complete a comprehensive assessment of needs before approving a proposal to
8 designate a hospital as a center for the treatment of trauma. (NRS 450B.237)
9 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations establishing the
10 standards for the designation of hospitals as centers for the treatment of trauma.
11 (NRS 450B.237) Existing regulations authorize the Administrator to designate a
12 center for the treatment of trauma as level I, II or III. (NAC 450B.780-450B.875)
13 Section 5 of this bill provides explicit statutory authorization for the State Board of
14 Health to adopt regulations establishing specific levels of trauma care that a
15 hospital may be designated to provide, including regulations that allow the
