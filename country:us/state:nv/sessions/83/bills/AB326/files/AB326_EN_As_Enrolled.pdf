Koenig; Cole and Torres-Fossett
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a center for the
treatment of trauma from representing it provides a specific
level of care unless the center provides that level of care;
authorizing the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
establishing specific designations for the level of care
provided by a center for the treatment of trauma; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires that before operating a center for the treatment of trauma,
a hospital must obtain the approval of the Administrator of the Division of Public
and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, if the
hospital is located in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
Clark County), the district board of health. (NRS 450B.236, 450B.237) Existing
law also requires the Administrator to verify that a hospital meets certain standards
and complete a comprehensive assessment of needs before approving a proposal to
designate a hospital as a center for the treatment of trauma. (NRS 450B.237)
Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations establishing the
standards for the designation of hospitals as centers for the treatment of trauma.
(NRS 450B.237) Existing regulations authorize the Administrator to designate a
center for the treatment of trauma as level I, II or III. (NAC 450B.780-450B.875)
Section 5 of this bill provides explicit statutory authorization for the State Board of
Health to adopt regulations establishing specific levels of trauma care that a
hospital may be designated to provide, including regulations that allow the
designation of a critical access hospital that meets certain requirements as a level
IV center for the treatment of trauma. Section 4 of this bill prohibits the operator of
a center for the treatment of trauma from representing that the center for the
treatment of trauma provides a specific level of treatment unless the center has been
designated by the Administrator to provide that level of treatment.
