EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the [State Board of] Department of
Health and Human Services to [adopt regulations establishing the
designation of centers for] conduct a study on the treatment of trauma
[as level I, II, III or IV; authorizing the State Board to adopt
regulations establishing additional designations; requiring approval
before a center for the treatment of trauma increases its designated
level;] in this State; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that before operating a center for the treatment of trauma, a hospital
2 must obtain the approval of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health
3 of the Department of Health and Human Services and, if the hospital is located in a county
4 whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the district board of
5 health. (NRS 450B.236, 450B.237) Existing law also requires the Administrator to verify that
6 a hospital meets certain standards and complete a comprehensive assessment of needs before
7 approving a proposal to designate a hospital as a center for the treatment of trauma. (NRS
8 450B.237) Existing regulations authorize the Administrator to designate a center for the
9 treatment of trauma as level I, II or III. (NAC 450B.780-450B.875) [Section 2 of this bill
10 incorporates those designations into existing law and additionally authorizes the designation
11 of a critical access hospital as a level IV center for the treatment of trauma. Section 2
12 additionally requires a hospital that wishes to increase the level of treatment provided by an
13 existing center for the treatment of trauma to submit to a similar application and approval
14 process as a hospital applying for initial designation as a center for the treatment of trauma.
15 Section 1 of this bill prohibits the operator of a center for the treatment of trauma from
16 representing that the center for the treatment of trauma provides a level of treatment unless the
17 center has been designated by the Administrator to provide that level of treatment.] Section
18 3.5 of this bill requires: (1) the Department of Health and Human Services to study
19 during the 2025-2026 interim the current system for the treatment of trauma in this

Assembly Amendment No. 432 to Assembly Bill No. 326 Page 4
20 State and the future needs of this State relating to the treatment of trauma; (2) the study
21 to include the solicitation of public comment on the subject matter of the study; and (3)
22 the Department to publish a report of the study on the Internet and submit the report to
23 the Governor and the Legislature.
