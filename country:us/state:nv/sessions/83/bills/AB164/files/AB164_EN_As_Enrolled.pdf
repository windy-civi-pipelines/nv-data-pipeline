Assembly Bill No. 164–Assemblymember O’Neill
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to postsecondary education; changing the balance
in the Account for Student Indemnification above which
certain postsecondary educational institutions are not
required to pay certain fees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires each postsecondary educational institution licensed by the
Commission on Postsecondary Education, generally privately owned postsecondary
educational institutions, to pay to the Administrator of the Commission a quarterly
fee of $5 for each student the institution initially enrolls in a calendar quarter in a
program for which the student pays a tuition or registration fee. Money from this
fee is required to be deposited in the State Treasury for credit to the Account for
Student Indemnification. (NRS 394.557) Money in the Account may be used to
indemnify a student or enrollee of a postsecondary educational institution who has
suffered damage because the postsecondary educational institution ceased
operations or due to a violation of certain provisions governing postsecondary
educational institutions that are licensed by the Commission. Money in the Account
may also be used for certain costs related to investigating claims for
indemnification from the Account. (NRS 394.553)
If the balance in the Account is $250,000 or more, existing law: (1) requires the
Administrator to notify the postsecondary educational institutions licensed by the
Commission; and (2) exempts such postsecondary educational institutions from
the requirement to pay the fee. If the balance in the Account subsequently falls
below $250,000, the Administrator is required to notify the postsecondary
educational institutions that the fee must again be paid until the balance in the
Account is $250,000 or more. (NRS 394.557) This bill raises the Account balance
above which postsecondary educational institutions are not required to pay the fee
from $250,000 or more to $750,000 or more.
