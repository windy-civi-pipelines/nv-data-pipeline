10 equitable relief; (2) actual damages; (3) reasonable attorney’s fees and costs; and

12 actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, whichever is greater.
13 Section 1 also authorizes a court to award to a prevailing defendant in such an
14 action reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, if the court finds that the action was not
15 well-grounded in fact and warranted by existing law or was interposed for an

25 expense of copyright litigation can be a significant burden on
26 Nevadans, Nevada businesses and the State of Nevada. The

28 most efficient resolution of copyright infringement claims without
29 conflicting with federal law.
30 4. The Legislature seeks, by this narrowly tailored act, to strike
31 a balance between the interests of efficient and prompt resolution of
32 copyright infringement claims, protection of Nevadans, Nevada
33 businesses and the State of Nevada from bad-faith assertions of
34 copyright infringement and the intentions to respect federal law and
35 be careful not to interfere with legitimate copyright enforcement
36 actions.
