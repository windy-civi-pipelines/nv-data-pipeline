EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing a maximum cost-
sharing amount that certain health insurers may impose
for a 30-day supply of prescription insulin drugs; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain policies of health insurance to include coverage
2 for the management and treatment of diabetes. Existing law requires that such
3 coverage be subject to the same deductible, copayment, coinsurance and other
4 conditions as are required under the policy for other types of health care. (NRS
5 689A.0427, 689B.0357, 695B.1927, 695C.1727) Sections 1, 4, 6-9, 11, 15 and 16
6 of this bill prohibit certain private health insurers from imposing a deductible,
7 copayment, coinsurance or other cost-sharing obligation greater than $35 for a 30-
8 day supply of a prescription insulin drug. Sections 2, 5, 10 and 13 clarify that an
9 insurer may be required by sections 1, 4, 9 or 11 to impose a different deductible,
10 copayment or coinsurance for a 30-day supply of a prescription insulin drug than
11 would otherwise be required by the relevant policy of health insurance for other
12 types of health care. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
13 Insurance to require certain policies of insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a
14 person who resides in another state to meet the requirements of section 1 in certain
15 circumstances. Sections 12 and 17 of this bill indicate that the requirements of
16 sections 11 and 16, respectively, are inapplicable to coverage provided by a health
17 maintenance organization or managed care organization to: (1) recipients of
18 Medicaid or insurance under the Children’s Health Insurance Program; and (2)
19 government employees and their dependents. Section 14 of this bill authorizes the
20 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority issued to a health
21 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 11.
22 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other

23 insurers that fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 4, 6-9, 15 and 16.
