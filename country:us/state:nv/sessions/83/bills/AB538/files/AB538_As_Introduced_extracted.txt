AN ACT relating to economic development; requiring the

tax abatement or a partial tax abatement; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753,
5 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) With certain exceptions, existing law requires
6 a partial tax abatement with a projected value to a single entity of $500,000 or more
7 to be approved by the Board of Economic Development and a partial tax abatement
8 with a projected value to a single entity of less than $500,000 to be approved by the
9 Executive Director of the Office of Economic Development. (NRS 231.0695)
10 Existing law requires an application for certain transferable tax credits which may
11 be issued to a new or expanded business to be considered by the Board if the
-
*AB538*
– 2 –
12 application is for transferable tax credits in an amount greater than $100,000. (NRS
13 231.1555) In addition to partial tax abatements, section 3 of this bill requires a tax
14 abatement or transferable tax credits, or a combination of tax abatements, partial
15 tax abatements and transferable tax credits, with a projected value to a single entity
16 or a single project of $500,000 or more to be approved by the Board.
17 Section 3 requires the Office, within 15 days after receiving an application for
18 a tax abatement, partial tax abatement or transferable tax credits which must be
19 approved by the Board and which is for a business or project that is or will be
20 located in a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties
21 other than Clark and Washoe Counties), to notify the governing body of the county,
22 city and school district in which the business or project is or will be located and the
23 president of each community college located in the county in which the business or
24 project is or will be located. Section 1 of this bill requires each entity which is
25 required to receive such notice, not later than 15 days before any meeting at which
26 the Board will consider such an application, to appoint a representative to serve as a
27 temporary voting member of the Board for the limited purpose of considering and
28 taking action on the application. Section 1 provides that a temporary voting
29 member does not receive compensation from the Board and is not counted as a
30 member of the Board for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
31 Additionally, sections 1, 2, 5 and 6 of this bill authorize a temporary voting
32 member to receive and view any information contained in the application which is
33 available to the other members of the Board.
34 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions
35 of section 1 requiring the appointment of temporary members applies if the Board
36 is required to consider an application for transferable tax credits for a new or
37 expanded business in an amount greater than $100,000.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 538–COMMITTEE ON REVENUE
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON REVENUE)
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the Board of
Economic Development. (BDR 18-419)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to economic development; requiring the
appointment of certain temporary members to the Board
of Economic Development for the limited purpose of
considering certain applications for transferable tax
credits, tax abatements and partial tax abatements;
requiring the Office of Economic Development to notify
certain entities upon receipt of an application for
transferable tax credits, a tax abatement or a partial tax
abatement for a business or project in certain rural
counties; requiring the Board to be the entity that
approves certain applications for transferable tax credits, a
tax abatement or a partial tax abatement; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753,
5 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) With certain exceptions, existing law requires
6 a partial tax abatement with a projected value to a single entity of $500,000 or more
7 to be approved by the Board of Economic Development and a partial tax abatement
8 with a projected value to a single entity of less than $500,000 to be approved by the
9 Executive Director of the Office of Economic Development. (NRS 231.0695)
10 Existing law requires an application for certain transferable tax credits which may
11 be issued to a new or expanded business to be considered by the Board if the
-
*AB538*

– 2 –
12 application is for transferable tax credits in an amount greater than $100,000. (NRS
13 231.1555) In addition to partial tax abatements, section 3 of this bill requires a tax
14 abatement or transferable tax credits, or a combination of tax abatements, partial
15 tax abatements and transferable tax credits, with a projected value to a single entity
16 or a single project of $500,000 or more to be approved by the Board.
17 Section 3 requires the Office, within 15 days after receiving an application for
18 a tax abatement, partial tax abatement or transferable tax credits which must be
19 approved by the Board and which is for a business or project that is or will be
20 located in a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties
21 other than Clark and Washoe Counties), to notify the governing body of the county,
22 city and school district in which the business or project is or will be located and the
23 president of each community college located in the county in which the business or
24 project is or will be located. Section 1 of this bill requires each entity which is
25 required to receive such notice, not later than 15 days before any meeting at which
26 the Board will consider such an application, to appoint a representative to serve as a
27 temporary voting member of the Board for the limited purpose of considering and
28 taking action on the application. Section 1 provides that a temporary voting
29 member does not receive compensation from the Board and is not counted as a
30 member of the Board for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
31 Additionally, sections 1, 2, 5 and 6 of this bill authorize a temporary voting
32 member to receive and view any information contained in the application which is
33 available to the other members of the Board.
34 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions
35 of section 1 requiring the appointment of temporary members applies if the Board
36 is required to consider an application for transferable tax credits for a new or
37 expanded business in an amount greater than $100,000.
