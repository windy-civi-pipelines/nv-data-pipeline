Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain persons who work for a landlord of dwelling units intended
2 and operated exclusively for certain older persons to undergo a criminal background check as
3 a condition of employment with the landlord. (NRS 118A.335) Section 1 of this bill requires a
4 landlord of a covered premises [comprising more than 100 dwelling units] to establish: (1) a
5 policy requiring certain applicants for employment to undergo a criminal background check as
6 a condition of employment; and (2) certain written policies and procedures relating to
7 dwelling unit keys. Section 1 also requires any such landlord to maintain on the premises: (1)
8 a log that accounts for the issuance and return of each dwelling unit key; and (2) the written
9 policies and procedures relating to dwelling unit keys established pursuant to section 1.
10 Section 1 defines the term “covered premises” to mean a premises comprising more
11 than: (1) 50 dwelling units attached to a single parcel of property in a county whose
12 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties); or (2) 10
13 dwelling units attached to a single parcel of property in a county whose population is less
14 than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 1
15 also authorizes a civil action to be brought against a landlord that violates the provisions
16 of section 1 by a person aggrieved by the violation or a district attorney.
