AN ACT relating to property; requiring certain landlords to establish a policy

landlords to take certain actions relating to dwelling unit keys;
requiring such landlords to maintain a log of certain information and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain persons who work for a landlord of dwelling units intended
2 and operated exclusively for certain older persons to undergo a criminal background check as
3 a condition of employment with the landlord. (NRS 118A.335) Section 1 of this bill requires a
4 landlord of a covered premises to establish: (1) a policy requiring certain applicants for
5 employment to undergo a criminal background check as a condition of employment; and (2)
6 certain written policies and procedures relating to dwelling unit keys. Section 1 also requires
7 any such landlord to maintain on the premises: (1) a log that accounts for the issuance and
8 return of each dwelling unit key; and (2) the written policies and procedures relating to
9 dwelling unit keys established pursuant to section 1. Section 1 defines the term “covered
10 premises” to mean a premises comprising more than: (1) 50 dwelling units attached to a single
11 parcel of property in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and
12 Washoe Counties); or (2) [10] 30 dwelling units attached to a single parcel of property in a
13 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and
14 Washoe Counties). Section 1 also authorizes a civil action to be brought against a landlord
15 that violates the provisions of section 1 by a person aggrieved by the violation or a district
16 attorney.
