EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to special license plates; providing for the issuance of special
license plates indicating support for the Las Vegas Aces basketball
team; exempting the special license plates indicating support for the
Las Vegas Aces basketball team from certain provisions otherwise
applicable to certain special license plates; subjecting the Las Vegas
Aces Foundation to certain reporting requirements and financial
investigations; imposing a fee for the issuance and renewal of the
special license plates indicating support for the Las Vegas Aces
basketball team; eliminating provisions prohibiting certain new vehicle
dealers from accepting an application for the registration of a motor
vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special license plates; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the issuance of various special license plates associated with
2 military or public service, membership or affiliation with certain groups and recognition of or
3 support for certain charitable causes or certain classes and types of vehicles. (NRS 482.3672-
4 482.3823) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to design, prepare
5 and issue special license plates indicating support for the Las Vegas Aces, a franchise of the
6 Women’s National Basketball Association. A person wishing to obtain the special license
7 plates must pay to the Department: (1) a fee for initial issuance of $35 and a fee for renewal of
8 $10; (2) all applicable registration and license fees and governmental services taxes; and (3)
9 an additional fee for initial issuance of $25 and an additional fee for renewal of $20, to be
10 deposited with the State Treasurer who must, on a quarterly basis, distribute the fees to the
11 Las Vegas Aces Foundation or its successor organization for its programs and activities within
12 this State in support of health and fitness, disadvantaged children and families, education and
13 women in sports. A person wishing to obtain the special license plates may also request that
14 the plates be combined with personalized prestige plates if the person pays the additional fees
15 for the personalized prestige plates. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply
16 provisions relating to the issuance and renewal of a special license plate for certain trailers to
17 include the Las Vegas Aces special license plate. Section 5 of this bill prohibits the
18 Department from issuing the Las Vegas Aces special license plate for a full trailer or
19 semitrailer.

Assembly Amendment No. 825 to Assembly Bill No. 117 Page 4
20 Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
21 Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of special license
22 plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may not be designed,
23 prepared or issued by the Department unless a certain number of applications for such plates
24 are received. (NRS 482.367002, 482.367008, 482.36705) Sections 6-8 of this bill exempt the
25 Las Vegas Aces special license plates from these provisions.
26 Section 9 of this bill [excludes] includes the Las Vegas Aces special license plates [from]
27 in the definition of “special license plate” for purposes of existing provisions governing
28 investigations relating to the finances of charitable organizations that receive additional fees
29 from special license plates. (NRS 482.38272-482.38279)
30 Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Department to order the preparation of
31 sample license plates that are of the same design and size as the Las Vegas Aces special
32 license plates.
33 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the holder of the original
34 registration of any vehicle to transfer the registration and use of the Las Vegas Aces special
35 license plates to another vehicle under certain circumstances.
36 Section 11 of this bill establishes a fee of $10 for the replacement of a Las Vegas Aces
37 special license plate.
38 Existing law authorizes the Department to authorize a new vehicle dealer to: (1) accept
39 applications for the registration of new motor vehicles he or she sells; and (2) issue certificates
40 of registration to applicants who satisfy the legal requirements to be issued a certificate of
41 registration. Existing law prohibits a new vehicle dealer who is authorized to issue certificates
42 of registration from accepting an application for the registration of a motor vehicle if the
43 applicant wishes to obtain special license plates. (NRS 482.216) Section 3 of this bill
44 eliminates the prohibition against a new vehicle dealer accepting an application for the
45 registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special license plates, thereby
46 authorizing a new vehicle dealer to accept an application for registration from such applicants.

32 6. The notice required pursuant to subsection 5 must be provided:

37 place or other matter that is depicted on the plate.
38 7. If, on December 31 of the same year in which notice was provided pursuant
39 to subsections 5 and 6, the total number of validly registered motor vehicles to

45  the Director shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
46 issue an order providing that the Department will no longer issue that particular
47 design of special license plate. Such an order does not require existing holders of
48 that particular design of special license plate to surrender their plates to the
49 Department and does not prohibit those holders from renewing those plates.

9 attributable to the remainder of the current registration period or calendar year on a
10 pro rata monthly basis against the tax due on the second vehicle or on any other

27 the vehicle to which registration is transferred is less than the credit on the total
28 registration fee or governmental services tax paid on all vehicles from which a

1 Such a credit may be applied by the person to the registration of any other vehicle
2 owned by the person. Any unused portion of the credit expires on the date the
3 registration of the vehicle from which the person obtained a refund was due to
4 expire.
