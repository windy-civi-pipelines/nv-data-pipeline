EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to special license plates; providing for the
issuance of special license plates indicating support for
the Las Vegas Aces basketball team; exempting the
special license plates indicating support for the Las Vegas
Aces basketball team from certain provisions otherwise
applicable to certain special license plates; subjecting the
Las Vegas Aces Foundation to certain reporting
requirements and financial investigations; imposing a fee
for the issuance and renewal of the special license plates
indicating support for the Las Vegas Aces basketball
team; eliminating provisions prohibiting certain new
vehicle dealers from accepting an application for the
registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to
obtain special license plates; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the issuance of various special license plates associated
2 with military or public service, membership or affiliation with certain groups and
3 recognition of or support for certain charitable causes or certain classes and types of
4 vehicles. (NRS 482.3672-482.3823) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department
5 of Motor Vehicles to design, prepare and issue special license plates indicating
6 support for the Las Vegas Aces, a franchise of the Women’s National Basketball
7 Association. A person wishing to obtain the special license plates must pay to the
8 Department: (1) a fee for initial issuance of $35 and a fee for renewal of $10; (2) all
9 applicable registration and license fees and governmental services taxes; and (3) an
-
*AB117_R1*
– 2 –
10 additional fee for initial issuance of $25 and an additional fee for renewal of $20, to
11 be deposited with the State Treasurer who must, on a quarterly basis, distribute the
12 fees to the Las Vegas Aces Foundation or its successor organization for its
13 programs and activities within this State in support of health and fitness,
14 disadvantaged children and families, education and women in sports. A person
15 wishing to obtain the special license plates may also request that the plates be
16 combined with personalized prestige plates if the person pays the additional fees for
17 the personalized prestige plates. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
18 to apply provisions relating to the issuance and renewal of a special license plate
19 for certain trailers to include the Las Vegas Aces special license plate. Section 5 of
20 this bill prohibits the Department from issuing the Las Vegas Aces special license
21 plate for a full trailer or semitrailer.
22 Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
23 Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of
24 special license plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may
25 not be designed, prepared or issued by the Department unless a certain number of
26 applications for such plates are received. (NRS 482.367002, 482.367008,
27 482.36705) Sections 6-8 of this bill exempt the Las Vegas Aces special license
28 plates from these provisions.
29 Section 9 of this bill includes the Las Vegas Aces special license plates in the
30 definition of “special license plate” for purposes of existing provisions governing
31 investigations relating to the finances of charitable organizations that receive
32 additional fees from special license plates. (NRS 482.38272-482.38279)
33 Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Department to order the
34 preparation of sample license plates that are of the same design and size as the Las
35 Vegas Aces special license plates.
36 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the holder of
37 the original registration of any vehicle to transfer the registration and use of the Las
38 Vegas Aces special license plates to another vehicle under certain circumstances.
39 Section 11 of this bill establishes a fee of $10 for the replacement of a Las
40 Vegas Aces special license plate.
41 Existing law authorizes the Department to authorize a new vehicle dealer to: (1)
42 accept applications for the registration of new motor vehicles he or she sells; and
43 (2) issue certificates of registration to applicants who satisfy the legal requirements
44 to be issued a certificate of registration. Existing law prohibits a new vehicle dealer
45 who is authorized to issue certificates of registration from accepting an application
46 for the registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special
47 license plates. (NRS 482.216) Section 3 of this bill eliminates the prohibition
48 against a new vehicle dealer accepting an application for the registration of a motor
49 vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special license plates, thereby authorizing a
50 new vehicle dealer to accept an application for registration from such applicants.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to special license plates.
(BDR 43-48)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to special license plates; providing for the
issuance of special license plates indicating support for
the Las Vegas Aces basketball team; exempting the
special license plates indicating support for the Las Vegas
Aces basketball team from certain provisions otherwise
applicable to certain special license plates; subjecting the
Las Vegas Aces Foundation to certain reporting
requirements and financial investigations; imposing a fee
for the issuance and renewal of the special license plates
indicating support for the Las Vegas Aces basketball
team; eliminating provisions prohibiting certain new
vehicle dealers from accepting an application for the
registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to
obtain special license plates; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the issuance of various special license plates associated
2 with military or public service, membership or affiliation with certain groups and
3 recognition of or support for certain charitable causes or certain classes and types of
4 vehicles. (NRS 482.3672-482.3823) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department
5 of Motor Vehicles to design, prepare and issue special license plates indicating
6 support for the Las Vegas Aces, a franchise of the Women’s National Basketball
7 Association. A person wishing to obtain the special license plates must pay to the
8 Department: (1) a fee for initial issuance of $35 and a fee for renewal of $10; (2) all
9 applicable registration and license fees and governmental services taxes; and (3) an
-
*AB117_R1*

– 2 –
10 additional fee for initial issuance of $25 and an additional fee for renewal of $20, to
11 be deposited with the State Treasurer who must, on a quarterly basis, distribute the
12 fees to the Las Vegas Aces Foundation or its successor organization for its
13 programs and activities within this State in support of health and fitness,
14 disadvantaged children and families, education and women in sports. A person
15 wishing to obtain the special license plates may also request that the plates be
16 combined with personalized prestige plates if the person pays the additional fees for
17 the personalized prestige plates. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
18 to apply provisions relating to the issuance and renewal of a special license plate
19 for certain trailers to include the Las Vegas Aces special license plate. Section 5 of
20 this bill prohibits the Department from issuing the Las Vegas Aces special license
21 plate for a full trailer or semitrailer.
22 Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
23 Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of
24 special license plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may
25 not be designed, prepared or issued by the Department unless a certain number of
26 applications for such plates are received. (NRS 482.367002, 482.367008,
27 482.36705) Sections 6-8 of this bill exempt the Las Vegas Aces special license
28 plates from these provisions.
29 Section 9 of this bill includes the Las Vegas Aces special license plates in the
30 definition of “special license plate” for purposes of existing provisions governing
31 investigations relating to the finances of charitable organizations that receive
32 additional fees from special license plates. (NRS 482.38272-482.38279)
33 Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Department to order the
34 preparation of sample license plates that are of the same design and size as the Las
35 Vegas Aces special license plates.
36 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the holder of
37 the original registration of any vehicle to transfer the registration and use of the Las
38 Vegas Aces special license plates to another vehicle under certain circumstances.
39 Section 11 of this bill establishes a fee of $10 for the replacement of a Las
40 Vegas Aces special license plate.
41 Existing law authorizes the Department to authorize a new vehicle dealer to: (1)
42 accept applications for the registration of new motor vehicles he or she sells; and
43 (2) issue certificates of registration to applicants who satisfy the legal requirements
44 to be issued a certificate of registration. Existing law prohibits a new vehicle dealer
45 who is authorized to issue certificates of registration from accepting an application
46 for the registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special
47 license plates. (NRS 482.216) Section 3 of this bill eliminates the prohibition
48 against a new vehicle dealer accepting an application for the registration of a motor
49 vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special license plates, thereby authorizing a
50 new vehicle dealer to accept an application for registration from such applicants.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 482 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
