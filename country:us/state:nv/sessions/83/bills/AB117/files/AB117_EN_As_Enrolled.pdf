CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to special license plates; providing for the
issuance of special license plates indicating support for the
Las Vegas Aces basketball team; exempting the special
license plates indicating support for the Las Vegas Aces
basketball team from certain provisions otherwise applicable
to certain special license plates; subjecting the Las Vegas
Aces Foundation to certain reporting requirements and
financial investigations; imposing a fee for the issuance and
renewal of the special license plates indicating support for the
Las Vegas Aces basketball team; eliminating provisions
prohibiting certain new vehicle dealers from accepting an
application for the registration of a motor vehicle if the
applicant wishes to obtain special license plates; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the issuance of various special license plates associated
with military or public service, membership or affiliation with certain groups and
recognition of or support for certain charitable causes or certain classes and types of
vehicles. (NRS 482.3672-482.3823) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department
of Motor Vehicles to design, prepare and issue special license plates indicating
support for the Las Vegas Aces, a franchise of the Women’s National Basketball
Association. A person wishing to obtain the special license plates must pay to the
Department: (1) a fee for initial issuance of $35 and a fee for renewal of $10; (2) all
applicable registration and license fees and governmental services taxes; and (3) an
additional fee for initial issuance of $25 and an additional fee for renewal of $20, to
be deposited with the State Treasurer who must, on a quarterly basis, distribute the
fees to the Las Vegas Aces Foundation or its successor organization for its
programs and activities within this State in support of health and fitness,
disadvantaged children and families, education and women in sports. A person
wishing to obtain the special license plates may also request that the plates be
combined with personalized prestige plates if the person pays the additional fees for
the personalized prestige plates. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
to apply provisions relating to the issuance and renewal of a special license plate
for certain trailers to include the Las Vegas Aces special license plate. Section 5 of
this bill prohibits the Department from issuing the Las Vegas Aces special license
plate for a full trailer or semitrailer.
Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of
special license plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may
not be designed, prepared or issued by the Department unless a certain number of
applications for such plates are received. (NRS 482.367002, 482.367008,
482.36705) Sections 6-8 of this bill exempt the Las Vegas Aces special license
plates from these provisions.
Section 9 of this bill includes the Las Vegas Aces special license plates in the
definition of “special license plate” for purposes of existing provisions governing
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
investigations relating to the finances of charitable organizations that receive
additional fees from special license plates. (NRS 482.38272-482.38279)
Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Department to order the
preparation of sample license plates that are of the same design and size as the Las
Vegas Aces special license plates.
Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the holder of
the original registration of any vehicle to transfer the registration and use of the Las
Vegas Aces special license plates to another vehicle under certain circumstances.
Section 11 of this bill establishes a fee of $10 for the replacement of a Las
Vegas Aces special license plate.
Existing law authorizes the Department to authorize a new vehicle dealer to: (1)
accept applications for the registration of new motor vehicles he or she sells; and
(2) issue certificates of registration to applicants who satisfy the legal requirements
to be issued a certificate of registration. Existing law prohibits a new vehicle dealer
who is authorized to issue certificates of registration from accepting an application
for the registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special
license plates. (NRS 482.216) Section 3 of this bill eliminates the prohibition
against a new vehicle dealer accepting an application for the registration of a motor
vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special license plates, thereby authorizing a
new vehicle dealer to accept an application for registration from such applicants.

registration fee paid on each vehicle attributable to the remainder of
the current calendar year or registration period on a pro rata basis
against the registration fee due on the vehicle to which registration
is transferred.
5. If the amount owed on the registration fee or governmental
services tax on the vehicle to which registration is transferred is less

tax paid on all vehicles from which a person transfers ownership or
interest, the person may apply the unused portion of the credit to the

portion of such a credit expires on the date the registration of the
vehicle from which the person transferred the registration was due
to expire.
6. If the license plate or plates are not appropriate for the
second vehicle, the plate or plates must be surrendered to the
Department or registered dealer and an appropriate plate or plates
must be issued by the Department. The Department shall not reissue

the provisions of subsection 9, issue to the person a credit in the
amount of the portion of the registration fee and governmental
services tax paid on the vehicle attributable to the remainder of the
current calendar year or registration period on a pro rata basis. Such
a credit may be applied by the person to the registration of any other
vehicle owned by the person. Any unused portion of the credit
expires on the date the registration of the vehicle from which the
person obtained a refund was due to expire.
9. The Department shall issue a refund pursuant to subsection 8
only if the request for a refund is made at the time the registration is
cancelled and the license plates are surrendered, the person
requesting the refund is a resident of Nevada, the amount eligible
for refund exceeds $100, and evidence satisfactory to the
