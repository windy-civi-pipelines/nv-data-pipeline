AN ACT relating to law enforcement; allowing a county sheriff to
enter into an agreement with certain federal agencies to
authorize their employees to enforce state or local laws, or
both, in certain circumstances; conferring the powers of a
peace officer on such employees in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a sheriff is required to be elected in each county of this
2 State, with certain exceptions, every 4 years. (NRS 248.010) Under existing law,
3 the general duties of a sheriff include keeping and preserving the peace in his or her
4 respective county, serving process in civil or criminal cases and apprehending or
5 securing any person for felony or breach of the peace. (NRS 248.090) Section 1 of
6 this bill authorizes a county sheriff to enter into a written agreement with specified
7 federal agencies to authorize employees of the federal agency who hold designated
8 positions to enforce state or local laws, or both, within the jurisdiction and authority
9 of the sheriff. Section 1 requires that the written agreement: (1) be limited to a term
10 of not more than 2 years; (2) designate the state or local laws, or both, to be
11 enforced; (3) designate the positions to which the agreement applies; and (4)
12 prescribe the grounds for revocation of the authority of an employee under the
13 agreement. Section 1 prohibits the agreement from granting any authority to an
14 employee of the federal agency that is outside of the jurisdiction and authority of
15 the sheriff.
16 Existing law establishes the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training
17 Commission and requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing
18 minimum standards for the certification and decertification, recruitment, selection
19 and training of peace officers. (NRS 289.500, 289.510) With certain exceptions,
20 existing law requires a person upon whom some or all of the powers of a peace
21 officer are conferred to be certified by the Commission within 1 year after
22 beginning employment as a peace officer, unless the Commission grants an

23 extension of not more than 6 months for good cause shown. A person who fails to
24 obtain this certification within the prescribed period of time is prohibited from
25 exercising the powers of a peace officer. (NRS 289.550) Section 1 mandates that an
26 employee of a federal agency who holds a position designated in an agreement
27 entered into pursuant to section 1 be certified by the Commission not later than 6
28 months after the date on which: (1) the written agreement became effective; or (2)
29 the person commences employment with the federal agency, if the person
30 commences employment after the date on which the written agreement became
31 effective. Section 3 of this bill exempts such federal employees from the time
32 frame in existing law for initial certification.
33 Existing law recognizes certain persons as peace officers. (NRS 289.150-
34 289.360) Section 2 of this bill confers the same powers of a peace officer on the
35 federal employees who hold positions designated in an agreement entered into
36 pursuant to section 1 when performing duties for the purposes, and within the
37 scope, of the written agreement.
