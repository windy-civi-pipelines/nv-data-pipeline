EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to gaming; removing and revising certain
provisions relating to the pari-mutuel system of wagering;
providing immunity from civil liability for certain
agencies, entities and persons relating to the pari-mutuel
system of wagering; defining certain terms relating to the
pari-mutuel system of wagering; repealing certain
provisions relating to the pari-mutuel system of wagering;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Commission to administer provisions
2 governing the issuance of licenses and to perform various acts relating to the
3 regulation and control of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. (Chapters 463 and
4 464 of NRS) Existing law: (1) authorizes the Nevada Gaming Control Board to
5 approve an agreement for a disseminator to disseminate a live broadcast from a
6 track where horse or other racing for pari-mutuel wagering is conducted; and (2)
7 establishes a statutory scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts and
8 certain information concerning racing. (NRS 463.421-463.427, 463.430-463.480)
9 Section 1.7 of this bill removes the provisions relating to disseminators and instead
10 authorizes a track to directly enter into an agreement with an operator of a race
11 book, sports pool or gambling game. Sections 1-1.3 and 1.6 of this bill make
12 conforming changes to eliminate references to disseminators, and section 2.9 of
13 this bill repeals the relevant provisions of existing law referencing disseminators
14 and the current statutory scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts.
15 Section 1.8 of this bill revises the term “service provider” to include an
16 “operator of a system,” as defined by section 2.1 of this bill, for purposes of
17 registering such operators with the Board rather than requiring the operators to be
18 licensed by the Commission. Section 2.9 repeals the corresponding provision
19 governing fees paid by an operator of a system, and sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this bill
20 make conforming changes to remove references to the repealed fees.

21 Section 2 of this bill provides that the State of Nevada, the Commission, the
22 Board, the Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Wagering Committee and certain other persons
23 are immune from civil liability for any decision or action taken in good faith and
24 without malicious intent in carrying out the provisions of law relating to the pari-
25 mutuel system of wagering. Section 2.1 defines certain terms for purposes of the
26 pari-mutuel system of wagering and, sections 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7 of this bill make
27 conforming changes to incorporate those terms.
28 Existing law requires certain persons who operate, carry on, conduct or
29 maintain any form of wagering under the pari-mutuel system of wagering to be
30 licensed. (NRS 464.010) Section 2.2 of this bill additionally provides that such
31 persons may be found suitable, registered or approved for such purposes. Sections
32 2.5 and 2.8 of this bill make conforming changes to incorporate the changes
33 allowing for registration.
34 Section 2.3 of this bill provides that neither the off-track pari-mutuel system
35 nor the operator of a system must be physically present in this State under certain
36 circumstances.

FIRST REPRINT S.B. 203
SENATE BILL NO. 203–SENATOR PAZINA
FEBRUARY 12, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the pari-mutuel system
of wagering. (BDR 41-608)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to gaming; removing and revising certain
provisions relating to the pari-mutuel system of wagering;
providing immunity from civil liability for certain
agencies, entities and persons relating to the pari-mutuel
system of wagering; defining certain terms relating to the
pari-mutuel system of wagering; repealing certain
provisions relating to the pari-mutuel system of wagering;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Commission to administer provisions
2 governing the issuance of licenses and to perform various acts relating to the
3 regulation and control of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. (Chapters 463 and
4 464 of NRS) Existing law: (1) authorizes the Nevada Gaming Control Board to
5 approve an agreement for a disseminator to disseminate a live broadcast from a
6 track where horse or other racing for pari-mutuel wagering is conducted; and (2)
7 establishes a statutory scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts and
8 certain information concerning racing. (NRS 463.421-463.427, 463.430-463.480)
9 Section 1.7 of this bill removes the provisions relating to disseminators and instead
10 authorizes a track to directly enter into an agreement with an operator of a race
11 book, sports pool or gambling game. Sections 1-1.3 and 1.6 of this bill make
12 conforming changes to eliminate references to disseminators, and section 2.9 of
13 this bill repeals the relevant provisions of existing law referencing disseminators
14 and the current statutory scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts.
15 Section 1.8 of this bill revises the term “service provider” to include an
16 “operator of a system,” as defined by section 2.1 of this bill, for purposes of
17 registering such operators with the Board rather than requiring the operators to be
18 licensed by the Commission. Section 2.9 repeals the corresponding provision
19 governing fees paid by an operator of a system, and sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this bill
20 make conforming changes to remove references to the repealed fees.

– 2 –
21 Section 2 of this bill provides that the State of Nevada, the Commission, the
22 Board, the Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Wagering Committee and certain other persons
23 are immune from civil liability for any decision or action taken in good faith and
24 without malicious intent in carrying out the provisions of law relating to the pari-
25 mutuel system of wagering. Section 2.1 defines certain terms for purposes of the
26 pari-mutuel system of wagering and, sections 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7 of this bill make
27 conforming changes to incorporate those terms.
28 Existing law requires certain persons who operate, carry on, conduct or
29 maintain any form of wagering under the pari-mutuel system of wagering to be
30 licensed. (NRS 464.010) Section 2.2 of this bill additionally provides that such
31 persons may be found suitable, registered or approved for such purposes. Sections
32 2.5 and 2.8 of this bill make conforming changes to incorporate the changes
33 allowing for registration.
34 Section 2.3 of this bill provides that neither the off-track pari-mutuel system
35 nor the operator of a system must be physically present in this State under certain
36 circumstances.
