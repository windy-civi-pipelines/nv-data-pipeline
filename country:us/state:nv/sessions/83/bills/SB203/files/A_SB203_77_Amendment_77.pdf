to the pari-mutuel system of wagering; providing immunity from
civil liability for certain agencies, entities and persons relating to the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Commission to administer provisions
2 governing the issuance of licenses and to perform various acts relating to the regulation and
3 control of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. [(Chapter] (Chapters 463 and 464 of NRS)
4 [This] Existing law: (1) authorizes the Nevada Gaming Control Board to approve an
5 agreement for a disseminator to disseminate a live broadcast from a track where horse
6 or other racing for pari-mutuel wagering is conducted; and (2) establishes a statutory
7 scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts and certain information
8 concerning racing. (NRS 463.421-463.427, 463.430-463.480) Section 1.7 of this bill
9 removes the provisions relating to disseminators and instead authorizes a track to
10 directly enter into an agreement with an operator of a race book, sports pool or
11 gambling game. Sections 1-1.3 and 1.6 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate
12 references to disseminators, and section 2.9 of this bill repeals the relevant provisions of
13 existing law referencing disseminators and the current statutory scheme governing the
14 dissemination of live broadcasts.
15 Section 1.8 of this bill revises the term “service provider” to include an “operator of
16 a system,” as defined by section 2.1 of this bill, for purposes of registering such operators
17 with the Board rather than requiring the operators to be licensed by the Commission.
18 Section 2.9 repeals the corresponding provision governing fees paid by an operator of a
19 system, and sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this bill make conforming changes to remove
20 references to the repealed fees.
21 Section 2 of this bill provides that the State of Nevada, the [Nevada Gaming]
22 Commission, the [Nevada Gaming Control] Board, the Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Wagering
23 Committee and certain other persons are immune from civil liability for any decision or action
24 taken in good faith and without malicious intent in carrying out the provisions of law relating
25 to the pari-mutuel system of wagering. Section 2.1 defines certain terms for purposes of the

Senate Amendment No. 77 to Senate Bill No. 203 Page 4
26 pari-mutuel system of wagering and, sections 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7 of this bill make
27 conforming changes to incorporate those terms.
28 Existing law requires certain persons who operate, carry on, conduct or maintain
29 any form of wagering under the pari-mutuel system of wagering to be licensed. (NRS
30 464.010) Section 2.2 of this bill additionally provides that such persons may be found
31 suitable, registered or approved for such purposes. Sections 2.5 and 2.8 of this bill make
32 conforming changes to incorporate the changes allowing for registration.
33 Section 2.3 of this bill provides that neither the off-track pari-mutuel system nor the
34 operator of a system must be physically present in this State under certain
35 circumstances.
