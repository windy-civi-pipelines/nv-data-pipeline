Senate Bill No. 203–Senator Pazina
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to gaming; removing and revising certain
provisions relating to the pari-mutuel system of wagering;
providing immunity from civil liability for certain agencies,
entities and persons relating to the pari-mutuel system of
wagering; defining certain terms relating to the pari-mutuel
system of wagering; repealing certain provisions relating to
the pari-mutuel system of wagering; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Commission to administer provisions
governing the issuance of licenses and to perform various acts relating to the
regulation and control of the pari-mutuel system of wagering. (Chapters 463 and
464 of NRS) Existing law: (1) authorizes the Nevada Gaming Control Board to
approve an agreement for a disseminator to disseminate a live broadcast from a
track where horse or other racing for pari-mutuel wagering is conducted; and (2)
establishes a statutory scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts and
certain information concerning racing. (NRS 463.421-463.427, 463.430-463.480)
Section 1.7 of this bill removes the provisions relating to disseminators and instead
authorizes a track to directly enter into an agreement with an operator of a race
book, sports pool or gambling game. Sections 1-1.3 and 1.6 of this bill make
conforming changes to eliminate references to disseminators, and section 2.9 of
this bill repeals the relevant provisions of existing law referencing disseminators
and the current statutory scheme governing the dissemination of live broadcasts.
Section 1.8 of this bill revises the term “service provider” to include an
“operator of a system,” as defined by section 2.1 of this bill, for purposes of
registering such operators with the Board rather than requiring the operators to be
licensed by the Commission. Section 2.9 repeals the corresponding provision
governing fees paid by an operator of a system, and sections 1.4 and 1.5 of this bill
make conforming changes to remove references to the repealed fees.
Section 2 of this bill provides that the State of Nevada, the Commission, the
Board, the Off-Track Pari-Mutuel Wagering Committee and certain other persons
are immune from civil liability for any decision or action taken in good faith and
without malicious intent in carrying out the provisions of law relating to the pari-
mutuel system of wagering. Section 2.1 defines certain terms for purposes of the
pari-mutuel system of wagering and, sections 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7 of this bill make
conforming changes to incorporate those terms.
Existing law requires certain persons who operate, carry on, conduct or
maintain any form of wagering under the pari-mutuel system of wagering to be
licensed. (NRS 464.010) Section 2.2 of this bill additionally provides that such
persons may be found suitable, registered or approved for such purposes. Sections
2.5 and 2.8 of this bill make conforming changes to incorporate the changes
allowing for registration.
Section 2.3 of this bill provides that neither the off-track pari-mutuel system
nor the operator of a system must be physically present in this State under certain
circumstances.
