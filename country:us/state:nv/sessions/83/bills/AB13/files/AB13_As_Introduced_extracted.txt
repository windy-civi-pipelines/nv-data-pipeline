AN ACT relating to criminal justice; clarifying provisions
concerning certain civil liabilities that arise upon the
discharge of a person from probation; authorizing a court
to grant a general discharge from probation under certain
circumstances; clarifying provisions relating to the
enforcement of a judgment which imposes certain
monetary penalties or requires a defendant to pay
restitution; providing that the rebuttable presumption that
records of criminal history should be sealed applies at the
discretion of the court to a defendant who is given a
general discharge from probation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes a court to grant certain persons an honorable
2 discharge from probation; and (2) requires the court to dishonorably discharge any
3 person who is not eligible for an honorable discharge from probation. (NRS
4 176A.850) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a court to grant a person who is not
5 eligible for an honorable discharge a general discharge if the court determines,
6 based on the nature and extent of compliance with the conditions of probation, that
7 a general discharge is appropriate.
8 Existing law: (1) provides that, upon the filing of a petition for the sealing of
9 certain criminal records, a rebuttable presumption exists that the records should be
10 sealed; and (2) makes the presumption inapplicable to a defendant who is
11 dishonorably discharged from probation. (NRS 179.2445) Section 3 of this bill
12 provides that the rebuttable presumption that records of criminal history should be
-

– 2 –
13 sealed applies at the discretion of the court to a defendant who is given a general
14 discharge from probation pursuant to section 2.
15 Existing law provides that a judgment which requires a defendant in a criminal
16 action to pay certain monetary penalties or restitution constitutes a lien which is
17 enforceable as a judgment in a civil action. (NRS 176.275) Section 2 clarifies that
18 the unpaid balance of any fine, fee, cost or assessment and any requirement to pay
19 restitution included in the judgment entered against a person who has been
20 discharged from probation constitutes a civil liability that: (1) arises upon the date
21 of discharge; and (2) is enforceable on the basis of the judgment. Section 1 of this
22 bill clarifies that independent actions may be commenced to enforce the provisions
23 of a judgment which: (1) impose a fine, fee, cost or assessment; or (2) require a
24 defendant to pay restitution.
