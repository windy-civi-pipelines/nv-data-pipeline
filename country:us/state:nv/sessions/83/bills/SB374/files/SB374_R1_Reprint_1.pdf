AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of
each school district to provide a certain percentage of
staff members with professional development training
concerning the discipline and behavior of pupils;
requiring the development and maintenance of a system to
assist the board of trustees of a school district and certain
governing bodies to address disproportionate or high
levels of pupil discipline; requiring each public school to
collect and report certain data on the number of pupils
assigned to a temporary alternative placement; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school to: (1) each quarter, collect data on the
2 discipline of pupils that includes, without limitation, information on the number of
3 expulsions and suspensions of pupils in the school; and (2) annually report such
4 data to certain entities. (NRS 392.462) Section 3 of this bill additionally requires
5 each public school to collect data on the number of pupils assigned to a temporary
6 alternative placement, thereby requiring such data to be included in the annual
7 report on the discipline of pupils prepared by each public school.
8 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
9 governing body of each charter school to ensure that the teachers and
10 administrators employed by the school district or charter school have access to
11 high-quality, ongoing professional development training. (NRS 391A.370) Section
12 1.5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to provide
13 professional development training to 20 percent of all staff members of the district
14 concerning, without limitation, the discipline and behavior of pupils at least once

15 each school year and any additional times throughout the year as the board of
16 trustees deems appropriate. If a staff member completes training as part of the
17 statewide framework for restorative justice, sections 1 and 1.5 of this bill authorize
18 such training to satisfy the training required by section 1.5. Section 1.5 further
19 requires the board of trustees of each school district to prepare and submit to the
20 Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education an annual report
21 that describes: (1) any such professional development training provided during the
22 previous year; (2) each date on which such training was provided; and (3) the total
23 percentage of staff members that attended such training during the immediately
24 preceding school year. Section 1.5 additionally authorizes the Department of
25 Education to coordinate with each regional training program or engage with an
26 appropriate vendor for the professional development of teachers and administrators
27 to develop curricula for such training that the board of trustees of a school district
28 may use to satisfy the requirements of section 1.5. Section 2 of this bill makes a
29 conforming change to apply the existing definition of “professional development
30 training” to the provisions of section 1.5.
31 Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department of Education to develop and
32 maintain a system to assist the board of trustees of a school district and the
33 governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils
34 in addressing disproportionate or high levels of pupil discipline. Section 2.3 of this
35 bill requires a school district or governing body that is required to participate in the
36 system to take certain actions to ensure the proper implementation and
37 effectiveness of the system. Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department to
38 submit an annual report to the Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing Committee
39 on Education concerning the implementation of and outcomes from the system.
40 Section 2.7 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law to section 2.3.
