AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of each school
district to provide [each] a certain percentage of staff [member]
members with professional development training concerning the
discipline and behavior of pupils; requiring the development and
maintenance of a system to assist the board of trustees of a school
district and certain governing bodies to address disproportionate
or high levels of pupil discipline; requiring each public school to
collect and report certain data on the number of pupils assigned to a
temporary alternative placement; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school to: (1) each quarter, collect data on the discipline
2 of pupils that includes, without limitation, information on the number of expulsions and
3 suspensions of pupils in the school; and (2) annually report such data to certain entities. (NRS
4 392.462) Section 3 of this bill additionally requires each public school to collect data on the
5 number of pupils assigned to a temporary alternative placement, thereby requiring such data to
6 be included in the annual report on the discipline of pupils prepared by each public school.
7 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
8 of each charter school to ensure that the teachers and administrators employed by the school
9 district or charter school have access to high-quality, ongoing professional development
10 training. (NRS 391A.370) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each
11 school district to [, not later than 30 days after the first day of instruction of each school year,
12 and such additional times throughout the year thereafter as the board of trustees deems
13 appropriate,] provide professional development training to [each] 20 percent of all staff
14 [member] members of the district concerning, without limitation, the discipline and behavior
15 of pupils [.] at least once each school year and any additional times throughout the year
16 as the board of trustees deems appropriate. If a staff member completes training as part
17 of the statewide framework for restorative justice, sections 1 and 1.5 of this bill authorize
18 such training to satisfy the training required by section 1.5. Section [1] 1.5 further
19 requires the board of trustees of each school district to prepare and submit to the Legislature
20 or the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education an annual report that describes: (1) any

Senate Amendment No. 417 to Senate Bill No. 374 Page 4
21 such professional development training provided during the previous year; (2) [how the school
22 district ensured such training was provided; and (3)] each date on which such training was
23 provided [.] ; and (3) the total percentage of staff members that attended such training
24 during the immediately preceding school year. Section [1] 1.5 additionally [requires]
25 authorizes the Department of Education to coordinate with each regional training program or
26 engage with an appropriate vendor for the professional development of teachers and
27 administrators to develop curricula for such training that the board of trustees of a school
28 district may use to satisfy the requirements of section [1.] 1.5. Section 2 of this bill makes a
29 conforming change to apply the existing definition of “professional development training” to
30 the provisions of section [1.] 1.5.
31 Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department of Education to develop and
32 maintain a system to assist the board of trustees of a school district and the governing
33 body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils in addressing
34 disproportionate or high levels of pupil discipline. Section 2.3 of this bill requires a
35 school district or governing body that is required to participate in the system to take
36 certain actions to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of the system.
37 Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department to submit an annual report to the
38 Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education concerning the
39 implementation of and outcomes from the system. Section 2.7 of this bill applies certain
40 definitions in existing law to section 2.3.
