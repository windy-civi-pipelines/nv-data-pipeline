AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of
each school district to ensure that by a certain date staff
members have access to professional development
training concerning the discipline and behavior of pupils;

levels of pupil discipline; requiring each public school to

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school to: (1) each quarter, collect data on the
2 discipline of pupils that includes, without limitation, information on the number of
3 expulsions and suspensions of pupils in the school; and (2) annually report such
4 data to certain entities. (NRS 392.462) Section 3 of this bill additionally requires
5 each public school to collect data on the number of pupils assigned to a temporary
6 alternative placement, thereby requiring such data to be included in the annual
7 report on the discipline of pupils prepared by each public school.
8 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
9 governing body of each charter school to ensure that the teachers and
10 administrators employed by the school district or charter school have access to
11 high-quality, ongoing professional development training. (NRS 391A.370) Section
12 1.5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to ensure that
13 not later than June 30, 2030, professional development training concerning the
14 discipline and behavior of pupils is available to all staff members of the district. If a

15 staff member completes training as part of the statewide framework for restorative
16 justice, sections 1 and 1.5 of this bill authorize such training to satisfy the training
17 required by section 1.5. Section 1.5 further requires the board of trustees of each
18 school district to prepare and submit to the Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing
19 Committee on Education an annual report that describes: (1) any such professional
20 development training provided during the previous year; (2) each date on which
21 such training was provided; and (3) the total percentage of staff members that
22 attended such training during the immediately preceding school year. Section 1.5
23 additionally authorizes the Department of Education to coordinate with each
24 regional training program or engage with an appropriate vendor for the professional
25 development of teachers and administrators to develop curricula for such training
26 that the board of trustees of a school district may use to satisfy the requirements of
27 section 1.5. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the existing
28 definition of “professional development training” to the provisions of section 1.5.
29 Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department of Education to develop and
30 maintain a system to assist the board of trustees of a school district and the
31 governing body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils
32 in addressing disproportionate or high levels of pupil discipline. Section 2.3 of this
33 bill requires a school district or governing body that is required to participate in the
34 system to take certain actions to ensure the proper implementation and
35 effectiveness of the system. Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department to
36 submit an annual report to the Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing Committee
37 on Education concerning the implementation of and outcomes from the system.
38 Section 2.7 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law to section 2.3.
