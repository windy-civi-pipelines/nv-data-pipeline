AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of each school
district to [provide a certain percentage of] ensure that by a certain
date staff members [with] have access to professional development
training concerning the discipline and behavior of pupils; requiring the
development and maintenance of a system to assist the board of
trustees of a school district and certain governing bodies to address
disproportionate or high levels of pupil discipline; requiring each
public school to collect and report certain data on the number of pupils
assigned to a temporary alternative placement; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school to: (1) each quarter, collect data on the discipline
2 of pupils that includes, without limitation, information on the number of expulsions and
3 suspensions of pupils in the school; and (2) annually report such data to certain entities. (NRS
4 392.462) Section 3 of this bill additionally requires each public school to collect data on the
5 number of pupils assigned to a temporary alternative placement, thereby requiring such data to
6 be included in the annual report on the discipline of pupils prepared by each public school.
7 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
8 of each charter school to ensure that the teachers and administrators employed by the school
9 district or charter school have access to high-quality, ongoing professional development
10 training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school
11 district to [provide] ensure that not later than June 30, 2030, professional development
12 training [to 20 percent of all staff members of the district] concerning [, without limitation,]
13 the discipline and behavior of pupils [at least once each school year and any additional times
14 throughout the year as the board of trustees deems appropriate.] is available to all staff
15 members of the district. If a staff member completes training as part of the statewide
16 framework for restorative justice, sections 1 and 1.5 of this bill authorize such training to
17 satisfy the training required by section 1.5. Section 1.5 further requires the board of trustees
18 of each school district to prepare and submit to the Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing
19 Committee on Education an annual report that describes: (1) any such professional
20 development training provided during the previous year; (2) each date on which such training

Assembly Amendment No. 934 to Senate Bill No. 374 First Reprint Page 4
21 was provided; and (3) the total percentage of staff members that attended such training during
22 the immediately preceding school year. Section 1.5 additionally authorizes the Department of
23 Education to coordinate with each regional training program or engage with an appropriate
24 vendor for the professional development of teachers and administrators to develop curricula
25 for such training that the board of trustees of a school district may use to satisfy the
26 requirements of section 1.5. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the
27 existing definition of “professional development training” to the provisions of section 1.5.
28 Section 2.3 of this bill requires the Department of Education to develop and maintain a
29 system to assist the board of trustees of a school district and the governing body of a charter
30 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils in addressing disproportionate or high
31 levels of pupil discipline. Section 2.3 of this bill requires a school district or governing body
32 that is required to participate in the system to take certain actions to ensure the proper
33 implementation and effectiveness of the system. Section 2.3 of this bill requires the
34 Department to submit an annual report to the Legislature or the Joint Interim Standing
35 Committee on Education concerning the implementation of and outcomes from the system.
36 Section 2.7 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law to section 2.3.
