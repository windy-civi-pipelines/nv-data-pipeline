Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political
2 subdivisions to award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
3 of specified projects that are financed in whole or in part from public money,
4 known as public works. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law creates the Office of
5 Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce specified
6 provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS 338.010-338.130,
7 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on public
8 works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
-
*AB502_R1*
– 2 –
9 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to
10 report certain information regarding the public works for the previous year to the
11 Labor Commissioner, except identifying information about a public work or an
12 apprentice or employee. Existing law further requires a contractor or subcontractor
13 on a public work to maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
14 supporting documentation to show that the contractor or subcontractor made a good
15 faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a good faith effort
16 includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice: (1)
17 not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin
18 work on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work
19 continuously on a public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or
20 subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165)
21 Section 1 of this bill removes the 10-day time limitation on requesting an
22 apprentice, thereby allowing for an apprentice to be requested by a contractor or
23 subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is scheduled to begin or
24 resume. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting identifying
25 information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
26 information to the Labor Commissioner.
27 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to:
28 (1) request an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the
29 number in any advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the
30 Labor Commissioner the award of a contract within 10 days after the award and
31 subsequently report the completion of the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013)
32 Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body request such an identifying number
33 not less than 3 business days before any advertisement or other type of solicitation
34 for the public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2 also authorizes a
35 penalty for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in
36 compliance with the reporting requirements.
37 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for
38 a violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner
39 is authorized to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public
40 work: (1) for the first offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition
41 of the administrative penalty; and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a
42 period of 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
43 (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill instead provides for the issuance of a warning
44 for the first offense and revises the duration of the period of the disqualification as
45 follows: (1) for the second offense, a period of 180 days after the date of the
46 imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the third offense, a period of 1 year
47 after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; and (3) for the fourth
48 or subsequent offense, a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the
49 administrative penalty.
50 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
51 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and
52 determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
53 Commissioner of any such violations. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires
54 a public body, within 90 days after substantial completion of a contract for a public
55 work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a determination regarding any
56 violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance Division, which is
57 created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill. Section 7
58 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
59 laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
60 receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a
61 written report concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of
62 the report to the referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3)
63 perform any other duties related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
-
*AB502_R1*
– 3 –
64 public works, as directed by the Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this
65 bill make conforming changes related to the creation of the Division.
66 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a
67 contractor on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of
68 certain laws relating to public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from
69 being withheld, retained or forfeited, except from the final payment, without a full
70 investigation being made by the awarding public body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5
71 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible offenses to the
72 Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the violation of
73 such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
74 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5
75 authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to
76 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer
77 possible violations to the Public Works Compliance Division within the prescribed
78 time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
79 violation of such provisions; and (2) an administrative penalty of $2,000 for each
80 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions. Section 5
81 also prohibits a public body from withholding from any contractor or subcontractor
82 engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
83 order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body by the Labor
84 Commissioner pursuant to section 5.

20 public work who has a driver’s license or identification card:
21 (1) The name of the worker;
22 (2) The driver’s license number or identification card number
23 of the worker; and
24 (3) The state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or
25 card.
26 6. The records maintained pursuant to subsection 5 must be
27 open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body
28 awarding the contract. The contractor engaged on the public work or
29 subcontractor engaged on the public work shall ensure that a copy of
30 each record for each calendar month is received by the public body
31 awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the
32 month. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a)
33 of subsection 5 must be open to public inspection as provided in
34 NRS 239.010. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to
35 paragraph (b) of subsection 5 is confidential and not open to public
36 inspection. The records in the possession of the public body
37 awarding the contract may be discarded by the public body 2 years
38 after final payment is made by the public body for the public work.
39 The Labor Commissioner shall adopt regulations authorizing and
40 prescribing the procedures for the electronic filing of the copies of
41 the records required to be provided monthly by a contractor or
42 subcontractor to a public body pursuant to this subsection.
43 7. A contractor engaged on a public work shall not withhold
44 from a subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums
45 necessary to cover any penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3
-
*AB502_R1*
– 12 –
1 of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld from the contractor by the
2 public body awarding the contract because the public body did not
3 receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor
4 pursuant to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified
5 in subsection 6 if:
6 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission
7 to the public body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later
8 than the later of:
9 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
10 (2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor;
11 and
12 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the
13 public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
14  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from
15 submitting a copy of a record for a calendar month directly to the
16 public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
17 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative
18 thereof, performing work for a public work who neglects to comply
19 with the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
20 9. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a public body has
21 failed to comply with the requirements of subsection 1, the Labor
22 Commissioner may impose against the public body:
23 (a) A fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found
24 to be in violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090,
25 inclusive, on the public work; and
26 (b) An administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or
27 subcontractor found to be in violation of the provisions of NRS
28 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, on the public work.
29 10. A public body shall not withhold from a contractor or
30 subcontractor engaged on a public work any amount due to the
31 contractor or subcontractor in order to recover any fee or penalty
32 assessed by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to subsection 9.
33 11. As used in this section, “substantial completion” means
34 that the construction of a public work is, in accordance with the
35 contract documents, sufficiently complete that the owner can
36 occupy and use the public work as intended.
37 Sec. 6. (Deleted by amendment.)
38 Sec. 7. Chapter 607 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
39 thereto a new section to read as follows:

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 502
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 502–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS)
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public works.
(BDR 28-401)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the
compliance of a contractor or subcontractor with certain
requirements relating to apprentices on a public work;
revising requirements relating to identifying numbers for
public works; revising provisions relating to the
imposition of penalties for certain violations; revising
provisions relating to the period within which a person is
disqualified from being awarded a contract for a public
work in certain circumstances; revising provisions
relating to the investigation of certain possible violations;
creating the Public Works Compliance Division within
the Office of Labor Commissioner and prescribing its
duties; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political
2 subdivisions to award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
3 of specified projects that are financed in whole or in part from public money,
4 known as public works. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law creates the Office of
5 Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce specified
6 provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS 338.010-338.130,
7 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on public
8 works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
-
*AB502_R1*

– 2 –
9 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to
10 report certain information regarding the public works for the previous year to the
11 Labor Commissioner, except identifying information about a public work or an
12 apprentice or employee. Existing law further requires a contractor or subcontractor
13 on a public work to maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
14 supporting documentation to show that the contractor or subcontractor made a good
15 faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a good faith effort
16 includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice: (1)
17 not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin
18 work on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work
19 continuously on a public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or
20 subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165)
21 Section 1 of this bill removes the 10-day time limitation on requesting an
22 apprentice, thereby allowing for an apprentice to be requested by a contractor or
23 subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is scheduled to begin or
24 resume. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting identifying
25 information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
26 information to the Labor Commissioner.
27 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to:
28 (1) request an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the
29 number in any advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the
30 Labor Commissioner the award of a contract within 10 days after the award and
31 subsequently report the completion of the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013)
32 Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body request such an identifying number
33 not less than 3 business days before any advertisement or other type of solicitation
34 for the public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2 also authorizes a
35 penalty for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in
36 compliance with the reporting requirements.
37 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for
38 a violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner
39 is authorized to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public
40 work: (1) for the first offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition
41 of the administrative penalty; and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a
42 period of 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
43 (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill instead provides for the issuance of a warning
44 for the first offense and revises the duration of the period of the disqualification as
45 follows: (1) for the second offense, a period of 180 days after the date of the
46 imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the third offense, a period of 1 year
47 after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; and (3) for the fourth
48 or subsequent offense, a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the
49 administrative penalty.
50 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
51 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and
52 determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
53 Commissioner of any such violations. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires
54 a public body, within 90 days after substantial completion of a contract for a public
55 work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a determination regarding any
56 violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance Division, which is
57 created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill. Section 7
58 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
59 laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
60 receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a
61 written report concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of
62 the report to the referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3)
63 perform any other duties related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
-
*AB502_R1*

– 3 –
64 public works, as directed by the Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this
65 bill make conforming changes related to the creation of the Division.
66 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a
67 contractor on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of
68 certain laws relating to public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from
69 being withheld, retained or forfeited, except from the final payment, without a full
70 investigation being made by the awarding public body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5
71 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible offenses to the
72 Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the violation of
73 such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
74 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5
75 authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to
76 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer
77 possible violations to the Public Works Compliance Division within the prescribed
78 time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
79 violation of such provisions; and (2) an administrative penalty of $2,000 for each
80 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions. Section 5
81 also prohibits a public body from withholding from any contractor or subcontractor
82 engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
83 order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body by the Labor
84 Commissioner pursuant to section 5.

10 apprenticed craft or type of work to be performed on those public
11 works.

*AB502_R1*

– 4 –
1 required to be performed by an apprentice pursuant to subsection 1
2 or 2 by not more than 2 percentage points.
3 4. An apprentice who graduates from an apprenticeship
4 program while employed on a public work shall:
5 (a) Be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes
6 of subsections 1 and 2.
7 (b) Be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes, including,
8 without limitation, the payment of wages or the payment of wages
9 and benefits to a journeyman covered by a collective bargaining
10 agreement.
11 5. If a contractor or subcontractor who is a signatory to a
12 collective bargaining agreement with a union that sponsors an
13 apprenticeship program for an apprenticed craft or type of work for
14 which the term of apprenticeship is not more than 3 years requests
15 an apprentice from that apprenticeship program and an apprentice in
16 the appropriate craft or type of work is not available, the contractor
17 or subcontractor may utilize a person who graduated from the
18 apprenticeship program in that craft or type of work within the 3
19 years immediately preceding the request from the contractor or
20 subcontractor. Such a person:
21 (a) Shall be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the
22 purposes of subsections 1 and 2.
23 (b) Shall be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes,
24 including, without limitation, the payment of wages and benefits to

26 6. A contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work is
27 not required to use an apprentice in a craft or type of work
28 performed in a jurisdiction recognized by the State Apprenticeship
29 Council as not having apprentices in that craft or type of work.
30 7. A contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work
31 shall maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
32 supporting documentation to show that the contractor or
33 subcontractor made a good faith effort to comply with subsection 1
34 or 2, as applicable, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. For
35 purposes of this subsection, a contractor or subcontractor:

3 the Labor Commissioner, at least once every 30 days during the
4 period that the contractor or subcontractor is working on the public
5 work. If a contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously
6 on the public work, the contractor or subcontractor shall submit an
7 additional request each time that the contractor or subcontractor
8 resumes work on the public work [not earlier than 10 days] before
9 the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the
10 public work and not later than 5 days after the contractor or
11 subcontractor actually resumes work on the public work. The

20 do so.

29 9. The contractor or subcontractor and the apprenticeship
30 program shall coordinate the starting date for any apprentice
31 provided by the program.

15 subcontractor did not make a good faith effort to comply with the
16 provisions of subsection 1 or 2, as applicable, the Labor
17 Commissioner shall notify the contractor or subcontractor in writing
18 of the determination and:

28 total hours of labor worked for an apprenticed craft or type of work,
29 a penalty of $3,000 or $4 for each hour below the percentage
