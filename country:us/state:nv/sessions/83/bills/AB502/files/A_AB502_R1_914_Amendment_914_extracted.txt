EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the compliance of
a contractor or subcontractor with certain requirements relating to
apprentices on a public work; revising requirements relating to
identifying numbers for public works; revising provisions relating to
the imposition of penalties for certain violations; revising provisions
relating to the period within which a person is disqualified from being
awarded a contract for a public work in certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to the investigation of certain possible violations;
creating the Public Works Compliance Division within the Office of
Labor Commissioner and prescribing its duties; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political subdivisions to
2 award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of specified projects that
3 are financed in whole or in part from public money, known as public works. (Chapter 338 of
4 NRS) Existing law creates the Office of Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor
5 Commissioner to enforce specified provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS
6 338.010-338.130, 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on
7 public works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
8 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to report certain
9 information regarding the public works for the previous year to the Labor Commissioner,
10 except identifying information about a public work or an apprentice or employee. Existing law
11 further requires a contractor or subcontractor on a public work to maintain and provide to the
12 Labor Commissioner any supporting documentation to show that the contractor or
13 subcontractor made a good faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a
14 good faith effort includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice:
15 (1) not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin work
16 on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on a
17 public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to
Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 4
18 resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165) Section 1 of this bill [removes] increases
19 the 10-day time limitation on requesting an apprentice [, thereby allowing for an apprentice to
20 be requested by a contractor or subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is
21 scheduled to begin or resume.] to 30 days. Section 1 also removes the exception for not
22 reporting identifying information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
23 information to the Labor Commissioner.
24 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to: (1) request
25 an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the number in any
26 advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the Labor Commissioner the
27 award of a contract within 10 days after the award and subsequently report the completion of
28 the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013) Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body
29 request such an identifying number not less than 3 business days before any advertisement or
30 other type of solicitation for the public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2
31 also authorizes a penalty for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in
32 compliance with the reporting requirements.
33 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for a
34 violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner is authorized
35 to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public work: (1) for the first
36 offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty;
37 and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a period of 5 years after the date of the
38 imposition of the administrative penalty. (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill [instead
39 provides for the issuance of a warning for the first offense and] revises the duration of the
40 period of the disqualification as follows: (1) for the first offense, for a period of up to 180
41 days after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the second
42 offense, for a period of up to 3 years but not less than 180 days after the date of the
43 imposition of the administrative penalty; [(2)] (3) for the third offense, for a period of [1 year]
44 up to 5 years but not less than 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative
45 penalty; and [(3)] (4) for the fourth or subsequent offense, for a period of [3] not less than 5
46 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
47 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
48 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and determine whether
49 a violation has been committed and inform the Labor Commissioner of any such violations.
50 (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires a public body, within 90 days after substantial
51 completion of a contract for a public work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a
52 determination regarding any violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance
53 Division, which is created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill.
54 Section 7 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
55 laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon receipt of a
56 referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report concerning
57 such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of the report to the referring public
58 body upon completion of the investigation; and (3) perform any other duties related to the
59 enforcement of certain provisions relating to public works, as directed by the Labor
60 Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes related to the creation
61 of the Division.
62 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a contractor
63 on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of certain laws relating to
64 public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from being withheld, retained or forfeited,
65 except from the final payment, without a full investigation being made by the awarding public
66 body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible
67 offenses to the Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the
68 violation of such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
69 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5 authorizes the
70 Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to investigate possible
71 violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer possible violations to the Public
72 Works Compliance Division within the prescribed time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each
73 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions; and (2) an
74 administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation
75 of such provisions. Section 5 also prohibits a public body from withholding from any
76 contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or
Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 5
77 subcontractor in order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body by the
78 Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 5.

16 3. On or after January 1, 2021, the Labor Commissioner, in collaboration with
17 the State Apprenticeship Council, may adopt regulations to increase the percentage
18 of total hours of labor required to be performed by an apprentice pursuant to
19 subsection 1 or 2 by not more than 2 percentage points.
20 4. An apprentice who graduates from an apprenticeship program while
21 employed on a public work shall:
22 (a) Be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes of
23 subsections 1 and 2.
24 (b) Be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes, including, without
25 limitation, the payment of wages or the payment of wages and benefits to a
26 journeyman covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
27 5. If a contractor or subcontractor who is a signatory to a collective
28 bargaining agreement with a union that sponsors an apprenticeship program for an
29 apprenticed craft or type of work for which the term of apprenticeship is not more
30 than 3 years requests an apprentice from that apprenticeship program and an
31 apprentice in the appropriate craft or type of work is not available, the contractor or
32 subcontractor may utilize a person who graduated from the apprenticeship program
33 in that craft or type of work within the 3 years immediately preceding the request
34 from the contractor or subcontractor. Such a person:
35 (a) Shall be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes of
36 subsections 1 and 2.

14 form prescribed by the Labor Commissioner, at least once every 30 days during the
15 period that the contractor or subcontractor is working on the public work. If a
16 contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on the public work, the
17 contractor or subcontractor shall submit an additional request each time that the

32 (4) The ethnicity of the worker, if the worker voluntarily agreed to specify
33 that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an entry indicating that the worker
34 declined to specify such information;
35 (5) If the worker has a driver’s license or identification card, an indication
36 of the state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or card; and
37 (6) The actual per diem, wages and benefits paid to the worker; and
38 (b) An additional accurate record showing, for each worker employed by the
39 contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work who has a driver’s
40 license or identification card:
41 (1) The name of the worker;
42 (2) The driver’s license number or identification card number of the
43 worker; and
44 (3) The state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or card.
45 6. The records maintained pursuant to subsection 5 must be open at all
46 reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body awarding the contract. The
47 contractor engaged on the public work or subcontractor engaged on the public work
48 shall ensure that a copy of each record for each calendar month is received by the
49 public body awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the month.
50 The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5 must
51 be open to public inspection as provided in NRS 239.010. The copy of the record
52 maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 5 is confidential and not open to
53 public inspection. The records in the possession of the public body awarding the
Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 11
1 contract may be discarded by the public body 2 years after final payment is made
2 by the public body for the public work. The Labor Commissioner shall adopt
3 regulations authorizing and prescribing the procedures for the electronic filing of
4 the copies of the records required to be provided monthly by a contractor or
5 subcontractor to a public body pursuant to this subsection.
6 7. A contractor engaged on a public work shall not withhold from a
7 subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums necessary to cover any
8 penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld
9 from the contractor by the public body awarding the contract because the public
10 body did not receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor pursuant
11 to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified in subsection 6 if:
12 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission to the public
13 body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later than the later of:
14 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
15 (2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor; and
16 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the public body by
17 the time specified in subsection 6.
18  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from submitting a copy of a
19 record for a calendar month directly to the public body by the time specified in
20 subsection 6.
21 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative thereof,
22 performing work for a public work who neglects to comply with the provisions of
23 this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
24 9. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a public body has failed to comply
25 with the requirements of subsection 1, the Labor Commissioner may impose
26 against the public body:
27 (a) A fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
28 violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, on the public
29 work; and
30 (b) An administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or subcontractor
31 found to be in violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive,
32 on the public work.
33 10. A public body shall not withhold from a contractor or subcontractor
34 engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
35 order to recover any fee or penalty assessed by the Labor Commissioner pursuant
36 to subsection 9.
37 11. As used in this section, “substantial completion” means that the
38 construction of a public work is, in accordance with the contract documents,
39 sufficiently complete that the owner can occupy and use the public work as
40 intended.
41 Sec. 6. (Deleted by amendment.)
42 Sec. 7. Chapter 607 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
43 section to read as follows:
44 The Public Works Compliance Division shall:
45 1. At the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon receipt of a referral
46 made by a public body pursuant to NRS 338.070:
47 (a) Investigate possible violations of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to
48 338.090, inclusive; and
49 (b) Submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report concerning an
50 investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (a). If the investigation was

Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public works. (BDR 28-401)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the compliance of
a contractor or subcontractor with certain requirements relating to
apprentices on a public work; revising requirements relating to
identifying numbers for public works; revising provisions relating to
the imposition of penalties for certain violations; revising provisions
relating to the period within which a person is disqualified from being
awarded a contract for a public work in certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to the investigation of certain possible violations;
creating the Public Works Compliance Division within the Office of
Labor Commissioner and prescribing its duties; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political subdivisions to
2 award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of specified projects that
3 are financed in whole or in part from public money, known as public works. (Chapter 338 of
4 NRS) Existing law creates the Office of Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor
5 Commissioner to enforce specified provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS
6 338.010-338.130, 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on
7 public works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
8 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to report certain
9 information regarding the public works for the previous year to the Labor Commissioner,
10 except identifying information about a public work or an apprentice or employee. Existing law
11 further requires a contractor or subcontractor on a public work to maintain and provide to the
12 Labor Commissioner any supporting documentation to show that the contractor or
13 subcontractor made a good faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a
14 good faith effort includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice:
15 (1) not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin work
16 on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on a
17 public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to

Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 4
18 resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165) Section 1 of this bill [removes] increases
19 the 10-day time limitation on requesting an apprentice [, thereby allowing for an apprentice to
20 be requested by a contractor or subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is
21 scheduled to begin or resume.] to 30 days. Section 1 also removes the exception for not
22 reporting identifying information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
23 information to the Labor Commissioner.
24 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to: (1) request
25 an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the number in any
26 advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the Labor Commissioner the
27 award of a contract within 10 days after the award and subsequently report the completion of
28 the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013) Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body
29 request such an identifying number not less than 3 business days before any advertisement or
30 other type of solicitation for the public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2
31 also authorizes a penalty for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in
32 compliance with the reporting requirements.
33 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for a
34 violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner is authorized
35 to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public work: (1) for the first
36 offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty;
37 and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a period of 5 years after the date of the
38 imposition of the administrative penalty. (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill [instead
39 provides for the issuance of a warning for the first offense and] revises the duration of the
40 period of the disqualification as follows: (1) for the first offense, for a period of up to 180
41 days after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the second
42 offense, for a period of up to 3 years but not less than 180 days after the date of the
43 imposition of the administrative penalty; [(2)] (3) for the third offense, for a period of [1 year]
44 up to 5 years but not less than 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative
45 penalty; and [(3)] (4) for the fourth or subsequent offense, for a period of [3] not less than 5
46 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
47 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
48 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and determine whether
49 a violation has been committed and inform the Labor Commissioner of any such violations.
50 (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires a public body, within 90 days after substantial
51 completion of a contract for a public work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a
52 determination regarding any violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance
53 Division, which is created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill.
54 Section 7 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
55 laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon receipt of a
56 referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report concerning
57 such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of the report to the referring public
58 body upon completion of the investigation; and (3) perform any other duties related to the
59 enforcement of certain provisions relating to public works, as directed by the Labor
60 Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes related to the creation
61 of the Division.
62 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a contractor
63 on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of certain laws relating to
64 public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from being withheld, retained or forfeited,
65 except from the final payment, without a full investigation being made by the awarding public
66 body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible
67 offenses to the Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the
68 violation of such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
69 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5 authorizes the
70 Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to investigate possible
71 violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer possible violations to the Public
72 Works Compliance Division within the prescribed time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each
73 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions; and (2) an
74 administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation
75 of such provisions. Section 5 also prohibits a public body from withholding from any
76 contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or

Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 5
77 subcontractor in order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body by the
78 Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 5.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 338.01165 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 338.01165 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and
3 except as otherwise provided in this section, a contractor or subcontractor engaged
4 in vertical construction who employs workers on one or more public works during a
5 calendar year pursuant to NRS 338.040 shall use one or more apprentices for at
6 least 10 percent, or any increased percentage established pursuant to subsection 3,
7 of the total hours of labor worked for each apprenticed craft or type of work to be
8 performed on those public works.
9 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and except as
10 otherwise provided in this section, a contractor or subcontractor engaged in
11 horizontal construction who employs workers on one or more public works during a
12 calendar year pursuant to NRS 338.040 shall use one or more apprentices for at
13 least 3 percent, or any increased percentage established pursuant to subsection 3, of
14 the total hours of labor worked for each apprenticed craft or type of work to be
15 performed on those public works.
16 3. On or after January 1, 2021, the Labor Commissioner, in collaboration with
17 the State Apprenticeship Council, may adopt regulations to increase the percentage
18 of total hours of labor required to be performed by an apprentice pursuant to
19 subsection 1 or 2 by not more than 2 percentage points.
20 4. An apprentice who graduates from an apprenticeship program while
21 employed on a public work shall:
22 (a) Be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes of
23 subsections 1 and 2.
24 (b) Be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes, including, without
25 limitation, the payment of wages or the payment of wages and benefits to a
26 journeyman covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
27 5. If a contractor or subcontractor who is a signatory to a collective
28 bargaining agreement with a union that sponsors an apprenticeship program for an
29 apprenticed craft or type of work for which the term of apprenticeship is not more
30 than 3 years requests an apprentice from that apprenticeship program and an
31 apprentice in the appropriate craft or type of work is not available, the contractor or
32 subcontractor may utilize a person who graduated from the apprenticeship program
33 in that craft or type of work within the 3 years immediately preceding the request
34 from the contractor or subcontractor. Such a person:
35 (a) Shall be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes of
36 subsections 1 and 2.
37 (b) Shall be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes, including, without
38 limitation, the payment of wages and benefits to a journeyman pursuant to the
39 collective bargaining agreement.
40 6. A contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work is not required to
41 use an apprentice in a craft or type of work performed in a jurisdiction recognized
42 by the State Apprenticeship Council as not having apprentices in that craft or type
43 of work.
44 7. A contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work shall maintain and
45 provide to the Labor Commissioner any supporting documentation to show that the

Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 6
1 contractor or subcontractor made a good faith effort to comply with subsection 1 or
2 2, as applicable, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. For purposes of this
3 subsection, a contractor or subcontractor:
4 (a) Makes a good faith effort to comply with subsection 1 or 2, as applicable, if
5 the contractor or subcontractor:
6 (1) Submits to the apprenticeship program, on the form prescribed by the
7 Labor Commissioner, a request for an apprentice not earlier than [10] 30 days
8 before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin work on the public
9 work and not later than 5 days after the contractor or subcontractor actually begins
10 work on the public work.
11 (2) If the apprenticeship program does not provide an apprentice for the
12 appropriate apprenticed craft or type of work upon a request pursuant to
13 subparagraph (1), submits additional requests to the apprenticeship program, on the
14 form prescribed by the Labor Commissioner, at least once every 30 days during the
15 period that the contractor or subcontractor is working on the public work. If a
16 contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on the public work, the
17 contractor or subcontractor shall submit an additional request each time that the
18 contractor or subcontractor resumes work on the public work not earlier than [10]
19 30 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the
20 public work and not later than 5 days after the contractor or subcontractor actually
21 resumes work on the public work. The requirement for the submission of an
22 additional request in this subparagraph does not apply whenever a contractor or
23 subcontractor has one or more apprentices employed for that apprenticed craft or
24 type of work.
25 (b) Does not make a good faith effort to comply with subsection 1 or 2, as
26 applicable, as determined by the Labor Commissioner, if the contractor or
27 subcontractor is required to enter into an apprenticeship agreement pursuant to
28 subsection 16 and refuses to do so.
29 8. The supporting documentation required pursuant to subsection 7 may
30 include, without limitation:
31 (a) Documentation of the submission by the contractor or subcontractor of one
32 or more requests, as applicable, pursuant to subsection 7; and
33 (b) Documentation that the apprenticeship program denied such a request, did
34 not respond to such a request or responded that the program was unable to provide
35 the requested apprentice.
36 9. The contractor or subcontractor and the apprenticeship program shall
37 coordinate the starting date for any apprentice provided by the program.
38 10. On or before February 15 of each year, a contractor or subcontractor
39 engaged in vertical or horizontal construction, as applicable, who employs a worker
40 on one or more public works pursuant to NRS 338.040 shall report to the Labor
41 Commissioner, on the form prescribed by the Labor Commissioner, the following

Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 7
1 (f) For each apprenticed craft or type of work, the percentage of the total
2 number of hours worked on horizontal construction that were worked by
3 apprentices.
4 11. The information required to be reported pursuant to subsection 10 must

Senate Amendment No. 914 to Assembly Bill No. 502 First Reprint Page 10
1 made to the subcontractor, the contractor may recover from the subcontractor the
2 amount of the penalty or forfeiture in a suit at law.
3 4. A contractor engaged on a public work and each subcontractor engaged on
4 the public work shall:
5 (a) Inquire of each worker employed by the contractor or subcontractor in
6 connection with the public work:
7 (1) Whether the worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her gender; and
8 (2) Whether the worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her ethnicity;
9 and
10 (b) For each response the contractor or subcontractor receives pursuant to

21 worker that such information, if provided, will be open to public inspection as set
22 forth in subsection 6.
23 5. A contractor engaged on a public work and each subcontractor engaged on
24 the public work shall keep or cause to be kept:

50 The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5 must
51 be open to public inspection as provided in NRS 239.010. The copy of the record

7 subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums necessary to cover any
8 penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld
9 from the contractor by the public body awarding the contract because the public
10 body did not receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor pursuant
11 to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified in subsection 6 if:
12 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission to the public
13 body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later than the later of:
14 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
15 (2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor; and
16 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the public body by
17 the time specified in subsection 6.
18  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from submitting a copy of a
19 record for a calendar month directly to the public body by the time specified in
20 subsection 6.
21 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative thereof,
22 performing work for a public work who neglects to comply with the provisions of
23 this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.

26 against the public body:
27 (a) A fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in

34 engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
35 order to recover any fee or penalty assessed by the Labor Commissioner pursuant
36 to subsection 9.
37 11. As used in this section, “substantial completion” means that the
38 construction of a public work is, in accordance with the contract documents,
39 sufficiently complete that the owner can occupy and use the public work as
40 intended.
