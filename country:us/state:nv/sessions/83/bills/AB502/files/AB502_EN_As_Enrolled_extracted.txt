requirements relating to apprentices on a public work;

public works; revising provisions relating to the imposition
of penalties for certain violations; revising provisions relating

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political
subdivisions to award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
of specified projects that are financed in whole or in part from public money,
known as public works. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law creates the Office of
Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce specified
provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS 338.010-338.130,

Section 2:
607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on public
works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to
report certain information regarding the public works for the previous year to the
Labor Commissioner, except identifying information about a public work or an
apprentice or employee. Existing law further requires a contractor or subcontractor
on a public work to maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
supporting documentation to show that the contractor or subcontractor made a good
faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a good faith effort
includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice: (1)
not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin
work on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work
continuously on a public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or
subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165)

Section 3:
Section 1 of this bill increases the 10-day time limitation on requesting an
apprentice to 30 days. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting
identifying information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
information to the Labor Commissioner.
Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to:
(1) request an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the
number in any advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the
Labor Commissioner the award of a contract within 10 days after the award and
subsequently report the completion of the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013)

Section 4:
Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body request such an identifying number
not less than 3 business days before any advertisement or other type of solicitation
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
for the public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2 also authorizes a
penalty for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in
compliance with the reporting requirements.
Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for
a violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner
is authorized to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public
work: (1) for the first offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition
of the administrative penalty; and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a
period of 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
(NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill revises the duration of the period of the
disqualification as follows: (1) for the first offense, for a period of up to 180 days
after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the second
offense, for a period of up to 3 years but not less than 180 days after the date of the
imposition of the administrative penalty; (3) for the third offense, for a period of up
to 5 years but not less than 3 years after the date of the imposition of the
administrative penalty; and (4) for the fourth or subsequent offense, for a period of
not less than 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and
determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
Commissioner of any such violations. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires
a public body, within 90 days after substantial completion of a contract for a public
work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a determination regarding any
violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance Division, which is
created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill. Section 7
of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a
written report concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of
the report to the referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3)
perform any other duties related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
public works, as directed by the Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this
bill make conforming changes related to the creation of the Division.
Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a
contractor on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of
certain laws relating to public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from
being withheld, retained or forfeited, except from the final payment, without a full
investigation being made by the awarding public body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5
requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible offenses to the
Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the violation of
such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5
authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to
investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer
possible violations to the Public Works Compliance Division within the prescribed
time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
violation of such provisions; and (2) an administrative penalty of $2,000 for each
contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions. Section 5
also prohibits a public body from withholding from any contractor or subcontractor
engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body by the Labor
Commissioner pursuant to section 5.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 502–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the
compliance of a contractor or subcontractor with certain
requirements relating to apprentices on a public work;
revising requirements relating to identifying numbers for
public works; revising provisions relating to the imposition
of penalties for certain violations; revising provisions relating
to the period within which a person is disqualified from being
awarded a contract for a public work in certain
circumstances; revising provisions relating to the
investigation of certain possible violations; creating the
Public Works Compliance Division within the Office of
Labor Commissioner and prescribing its duties; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political
subdivisions to award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
of specified projects that are financed in whole or in part from public money,
known as public works. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law creates the Office of
Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce specified
provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS 338.010-338.130,
607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on public
works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to
report certain information regarding the public works for the previous year to the
Labor Commissioner, except identifying information about a public work or an
apprentice or employee. Existing law further requires a contractor or subcontractor
on a public work to maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
supporting documentation to show that the contractor or subcontractor made a good
faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a good faith effort
includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice: (1)
not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin
work on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work
continuously on a public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or
subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165)
Section 1 of this bill increases the 10-day time limitation on requesting an
apprentice to 30 days. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting
identifying information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
information to the Labor Commissioner.
Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to:
(1) request an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the
number in any advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the
Labor Commissioner the award of a contract within 10 days after the award and
subsequently report the completion of the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013)
Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body request such an identifying number
not less than 3 business days before any advertisement or other type of solicitation
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
for the public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2 also authorizes a
penalty for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in
compliance with the reporting requirements.
Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for
a violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner
is authorized to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public
work: (1) for the first offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition
of the administrative penalty; and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a
period of 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
(NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill revises the duration of the period of the
disqualification as follows: (1) for the first offense, for a period of up to 180 days
after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the second
offense, for a period of up to 3 years but not less than 180 days after the date of the
imposition of the administrative penalty; (3) for the third offense, for a period of up
to 5 years but not less than 3 years after the date of the imposition of the
administrative penalty; and (4) for the fourth or subsequent offense, for a period of
not less than 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and
determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
Commissioner of any such violations. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires
a public body, within 90 days after substantial completion of a contract for a public
work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a determination regarding any
violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance Division, which is
created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill. Section 7
of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a
written report concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of
the report to the referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3)
perform any other duties related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
public works, as directed by the Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this
bill make conforming changes related to the creation of the Division.
Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a
contractor on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of
certain laws relating to public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from
being withheld, retained or forfeited, except from the final payment, without a full
investigation being made by the awarding public body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5
requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible offenses to the
Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the violation of
such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5
authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to
investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer
possible violations to the Public Works Compliance Division within the prescribed
time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
violation of such provisions; and (2) an administrative penalty of $2,000 for each
contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions. Section 5
also prohibits a public body from withholding from any contractor or subcontractor
engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body by the Labor
Commissioner pursuant to section 5.

338.070 1. Any public body awarding a contract shall [:] ,
within 90 days after substantial completion of the contract:
(a) Investigate possible violations of the provisions of NRS
338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, committed in the course of the
execution of the contract, and determine whether a violation has
been committed and inform the Labor Commissioner of any such
violations; [and] or
(b) Refer a possible violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010
to 338.090, inclusive, to the Public Works Compliance Division in
the Office of Labor Commissioner. Such a referral must be made
on a form prescribed by the Labor Commissioner.
2. [When] Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
when making payments to the contractor engaged on the public
work of money becoming due under the contract, a public body
shall withhold and retain all sums forfeited pursuant to the
provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive.

– 10 –
[2.] No sum may be withheld, retained or forfeited, except
from the final payment, without a full investigation being made by
the awarding public body [.] or the Public Works Compliance
Division pursuant to section 7 of this act.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, it is lawful for
any contractor engaged on a public work to withhold from any
subcontractor engaged on the public work sufficient sums to cover
any penalties withheld from the contractor by the awarding public
body on account of the failure of the subcontractor to comply with
the terms of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive. If payment has
already been made to the subcontractor, the contractor may recover
from the subcontractor the amount of the penalty or forfeiture in a
suit at law.
4. A contractor engaged on a public work and each
subcontractor engaged on the public work shall:
(a) Inquire of each worker employed by the contractor or
subcontractor in connection with the public work:
(1) Whether the worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or
her gender; and
(2) Whether the worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or
her ethnicity; and
(b) For each response the contractor or subcontractor receives
pursuant to paragraph (a):
(1) If the worker chose voluntarily to specify his or her
gender or ethnicity, or both, record the worker’s responses; and
(2) If the worker declined to specify his or her gender or
ethnicity, or both, record that the worker declined to specify such
information.
 A contractor or subcontractor shall not compel or coerce a worker
to specify his or her gender or ethnicity and shall not penalize or
otherwise take any adverse action against a worker who declines to
specify his or her gender or ethnicity. Before inquiring as to whether
a worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her gender or ethnicity,
the applicable contractor or subcontractor must inform the worker
that such information, if provided, will be open to public inspection
as set forth in subsection 6.
5. A contractor engaged on a public work and each
subcontractor engaged on the public work shall keep or cause to be
kept:
(a) An accurate record showing, for each worker employed by
the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work:
(1) The name of the worker;
(2) The occupation of the worker;
-

– 11 –
(3) The gender of the worker, if the worker voluntarily
agreed to specify that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an
entry indicating that the worker declined to specify such
information;
(4) The ethnicity of the worker, if the worker voluntarily
agreed to specify that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an
entry indicating that the worker declined to specify such
information;
(5) If the worker has a driver’s license or identification card,
an indication of the state or other jurisdiction that issued the license
or card; and
(6) The actual per diem, wages and benefits paid to the
worker; and
(b) An additional accurate record showing, for each worker
employed by the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the
public work who has a driver’s license or identification card:
(1) The name of the worker;
(2) The driver’s license number or identification card number
of the worker; and
(3) The state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or
card.
6. The records maintained pursuant to subsection 5 must be
open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body
awarding the contract. The contractor engaged on the public work or
subcontractor engaged on the public work shall ensure that a copy of
each record for each calendar month is received by the public body
awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the
month. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a)
of subsection 5 must be open to public inspection as provided in
NRS 239.010. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) of subsection 5 is confidential and not open to public
inspection. The records in the possession of the public body
awarding the contract may be discarded by the public body 2 years
after final payment is made by the public body for the public work.
The Labor Commissioner shall adopt regulations authorizing and
prescribing the procedures for the electronic filing of the copies of
the records required to be provided monthly by a contractor or
subcontractor to a public body pursuant to this subsection.
7. A contractor engaged on a public work shall not withhold
from a subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums
necessary to cover any penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld from the contractor by the
public body awarding the contract because the public body did not
-

– 12 –
receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor
pursuant to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified
in subsection 6 if:
(a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission
to the public body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later
than the later of:
(1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
(2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor;
and
(b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the
public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
 Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from
submitting a copy of a record for a calendar month directly to the
public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative
thereof, performing work for a public work who neglects to comply
with the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
9. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a public body has
failed to comply with the requirements of subsection 1, the Labor
Commissioner may impose against the public body:
(a) A fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found
to be in violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090,
inclusive, on the public work; and
(b) An administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or
subcontractor found to be in violation of the provisions of NRS
338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, on the public work.
10. A public body shall not withhold from a contractor or
subcontractor engaged on a public work any amount due to the
contractor or subcontractor in order to recover any fee or penalty
assessed by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to subsection 9.
11. As used in this section, “substantial completion” means
that the construction of a public work is, in accordance with the
contract documents, sufficiently complete that the owner can
occupy and use the public work as intended.
