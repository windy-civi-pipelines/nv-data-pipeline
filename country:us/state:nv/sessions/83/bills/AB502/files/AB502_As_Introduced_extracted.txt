Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political
2 subdivisions to award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
3 of specified projects that are financed in whole or in part from public money,
4 known as public works. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law creates the Office of
5 Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce specified
6 provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS 338.010-338.130,
7 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on public
8 works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
-
*AB502*
– 2 –
9 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to
10 report certain information regarding the public works for the previous year to the
11 Labor Commissioner, except identifying information about a public work or an
12 apprentice or employee. Existing law further requires a contractor or subcontractor
13 on a public work to maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
14 supporting documentation to show that the contractor or subcontractor made a good
15 faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a good faith effort
16 includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice: (1)
17 not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin
18 work on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work
19 continuously on a public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or
20 subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165)
21 Section 1 of this bill removes the 10-day time limitation on requesting an
22 apprentice, thereby allowing for an apprentice to be requested by a contractor or
23 subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is scheduled to begin or
24 resume. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting identifying
25 information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
26 information to the Labor Commissioner.
27 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to:
28 (1) request an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the
29 number in any advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the
30 Labor Commissioner the award of a contract within 10 days after the award and
31 subsequently report the completion of the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013)
32 Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body request such an identifying number
33 not less than 10 days before any advertisement or other type of solicitation for the
34 public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2 also imposes a penalty
35 for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in compliance
36 with the reporting requirements.
37 Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose an administrative
38 penalty, in addition to any other remedy or penalty authorized by law, if any
39 person, including, without limitation, a public body, violates certain provisions
40 relating to public works in the amount of not more than $5,000 for each such
41 violation. (NRS 338.015) Section 3 of this bill limits the existing maximum penalty
42 to the first violation and authorizes the imposition of an administrative penalty of
43 not less than $5,000 for each subsequent violation.
44 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for
45 a violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner
46 is authorized to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public
47 work: (1) for the first offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition
48 of the administrative penalty; and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a
49 period of 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
50 (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill instead provides for the issuance of a warning
51 for the first offense and revises the duration of the period of the disqualification as
52 follows: (1) for the second offense, a period of 180 days after the date of the
53 imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the third offense, a period of 1 year
54 after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; and (3) for the fourth
55 or subsequent offense, a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the
56 administrative penalty.
57 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
58 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and
59 determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
60 Commissioner of any such violations. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires
61 a public body, within 30 days after substantial completion of a contract for a public
62 work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a determination regarding any
63 violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance Division, which is
-
*AB502*
– 3 –
64 created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill. Section 7
65 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
66 laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
67 receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a
68 written report concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of
69 the report to the referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3)
70 perform any other duties related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
71 public works, as directed by the Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this
72 bill make conforming changes related to the creation of the Division.
73 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a
74 contractor on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of
75 certain laws relating to public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from
76 being withheld, retained or forfeited, except from the final payment, without a full
77 investigation being made by the awarding public body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5
78 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible offenses to the
79 Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the violation of
80 such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
81 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5
82 authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to
83 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer
84 possible violations to the Public Works Compliance Division within the prescribed
85 time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
86 violation of such provisions; and (2) an administrative penalty of $2,000 for each
87 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions.
88 Existing law requires that a person found to have willfully and repeatedly failed
89 to pay the prevailing wage required by law be required to pay certain damages to
90 each affected worker. (NRS 338.090) Section 6 of this bill removes the
91 requirement of willfulness, thus making the penalty applicable to a person who
92 repeatedly fails to pay the prevailing wage.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

14 ethnicity, or both, record that the worker declined to specify such
15 information.
16  A contractor or subcontractor shall not compel or coerce a worker
17 to specify his or her gender or ethnicity and shall not penalize or
18 otherwise take any adverse action against a worker who declines to
19 specify his or her gender or ethnicity. Before inquiring as to whether
20 a worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her gender or ethnicity,
21 the applicable contractor or subcontractor must inform the worker
22 that such information, if provided, will be open to public inspection
23 as set forth in subsection 6.
24 5. A contractor engaged on a public work and each
25 subcontractor engaged on the public work shall keep or cause to be
26 kept:
27 (a) An accurate record showing, for each worker employed by
28 the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work:
29 (1) The name of the worker;
30 (2) The occupation of the worker;
31 (3) The gender of the worker, if the worker voluntarily
32 agreed to specify that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an
33 entry indicating that the worker declined to specify such
34 information;
35 (4) The ethnicity of the worker, if the worker voluntarily
36 agreed to specify that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an
37 entry indicating that the worker declined to specify such
38 information;
39 (5) If the worker has a driver’s license or identification card,
40 an indication of the state or other jurisdiction that issued the license
41 or card; and
42 (6) The actual per diem, wages and benefits paid to the
43 worker; and

– 12 –
1 (b) An additional accurate record showing, for each worker
2 employed by the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the
3 public work who has a driver’s license or identification card:
4 (1) The name of the worker;
5 (2) The driver’s license number or identification card number
6 of the worker; and
7 (3) The state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or
8 card.
9 6. The records maintained pursuant to subsection 5 must be
10 open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body
11 awarding the contract. The contractor engaged on the public work or
12 subcontractor engaged on the public work shall ensure that a copy of
13 each record for each calendar month is received by the public body
14 awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the
15 month. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a)
16 of subsection 5 must be open to public inspection as provided in
17 NRS 239.010. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to
18 paragraph (b) of subsection 5 is confidential and not open to public
19 inspection. The records in the possession of the public body
20 awarding the contract may be discarded by the public body 2 years
21 after final payment is made by the public body for the public work.
22 The Labor Commissioner shall adopt regulations authorizing and
23 prescribing the procedures for the electronic filing of the copies of
24 the records required to be provided monthly by a contractor or
25 subcontractor to a public body pursuant to this subsection.
26 7. A contractor engaged on a public work shall not withhold
27 from a subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums
28 necessary to cover any penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3
29 of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld from the contractor by the
30 public body awarding the contract because the public body did not
31 receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor
32 pursuant to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified
33 in subsection 6 if:
34 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission
35 to the public body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later
36 than the later of:
37 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
38 (2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor;
39 and
40 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the
41 public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
42  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from
43 submitting a copy of a record for a calendar month directly to the
44 public body by the time specified in subsection 6.

– 13 –
1 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative
2 thereof, performing work for a public work who neglects to comply
3 with the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
4 9. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a public body has
5 failed to comply with the requirements of subsection 1, the Labor
6 Commissioner shall impose against the public body:
7 (a) A fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found
8 to be in violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090,
9 inclusive, on the public work; and
10 (b) An administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or
11 subcontractor found to be in violation of the provisions of NRS
12 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, on the public work.
13 10. As used in this section, “substantial completion” means
14 that the construction of a public work is, in accordance with the
15 contract documents, sufficiently complete that the owner can
16 occupy and use the public work as intended.
17 Sec. 6. NRS 338.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 338.090 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, any
19 person, including the officers, agents or employees of a public body,
20 who violates any provision of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive,
21 or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto, is guilty of a
22 misdemeanor.
23 2. The Labor Commissioner, in addition to any other remedy or
24 penalty provided in this chapter:
25 (a) Shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, assess a
26 person who, after an opportunity for a hearing, is found to have
27 failed to pay the prevailing wage required pursuant to NRS 338.020
28 to 338.090, inclusive, an amount equal to the difference between the
29 prevailing wages required to be paid and the wages that the
30 contractor or subcontractor actually paid;
31 (b) Shall require a person found to have [willfully and]
32 repeatedly failed to pay the prevailing wage required pursuant to
33 NRS 338.020 to 338.090, inclusive, to pay damages to each affected
34 worker in an amount equal to the difference between the prevailing
35 wages required to be paid and the wages that the contractor or
36 subcontractor actually paid to the worker; and
37 (c) May, in addition to any other administrative penalty, impose
38 an administrative penalty not to exceed the costs incurred by the
39 Labor Commissioner to investigate and prosecute the matter.
40 3. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a person has failed to
41 pay the prevailing wage required pursuant to NRS 338.020 to
42 338.090, inclusive, the public body may, in addition to any other
43 remedy or penalty provided in this chapter, require the person to pay
44 the actual costs incurred by the public body to investigate the
45 matter.

– 14 –
1 4. The Labor Commissioner is not required to assess a person
2 an amount equal to the difference between the prevailing wages
3 required to be paid and the wages that the contractor or
4 subcontractor actually paid if the contractor or subcontractor has
5 already paid that amount to a worker pursuant to paragraph (c) of
6 subsection 4 of NRS 338.035.
7 5. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to a
8 subcontractor specified in NRS 338.072.
9 Sec. 7. Chapter 607 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
10 thereto a new section to read as follows:
11 The Public Works Compliance Division shall:
12 1. At the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon

16 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive; and
17 (b) Submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report
18 concerning an investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (a).
19 If the investigation was conducted pursuant to a referral made by
20 a public body pursuant to NRS 338.070, a copy of the report must
21 be provided to the public body.
22 2. Perform any other duties related to the enforcement of
23 NRS 338.010 to 338.130, inclusive, as directed by the Labor
24 Commissioner.

27 The Office consists of the Labor Commissioner and the Public
28 Works Compliance Division.
29 Sec. 9. NRS 607.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 502–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS)
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public works.
(BDR 28-401)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the
compliance of a contractor or subcontractor with certain
requirements relating to apprentices on a public work;
revising requirements relating to identifying numbers for
public works; revising provisions relating to the
imposition of penalties for certain violations; revising
provisions relating to the period within which a person is
disqualified from being awarded a contract for a public
work in certain circumstances; revising provisions
relating to the investigation of certain possible violations;
creating the Public Works Compliance Division within
the Office of Labor Commissioner and prescribing its
duties; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political
2 subdivisions to award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
3 of specified projects that are financed in whole or in part from public money,
4 known as public works. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law creates the Office of
5 Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce specified
6 provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS 338.010-338.130,
7 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on public
8 works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
-
*AB502*

– 2 –
9 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to
10 report certain information regarding the public works for the previous year to the
11 Labor Commissioner, except identifying information about a public work or an
12 apprentice or employee. Existing law further requires a contractor or subcontractor
13 on a public work to maintain and provide to the Labor Commissioner any
14 supporting documentation to show that the contractor or subcontractor made a good
15 faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a good faith effort
16 includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice: (1)
17 not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin
18 work on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work
19 continuously on a public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or
20 subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165)
21 Section 1 of this bill removes the 10-day time limitation on requesting an
22 apprentice, thereby allowing for an apprentice to be requested by a contractor or
23 subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is scheduled to begin or
24 resume. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting identifying
25 information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such
26 information to the Labor Commissioner.
27 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to:
28 (1) request an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the
29 number in any advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the
30 Labor Commissioner the award of a contract within 10 days after the award and
31 subsequently report the completion of the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013)
32 Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body request such an identifying number
33 not less than 10 days before any advertisement or other type of solicitation for the
34 public work is published or made, as applicable. Section 2 also imposes a penalty
35 for each calendar day or portion thereof that a public body is not in compliance
36 with the reporting requirements.
37 Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose an administrative
38 penalty, in addition to any other remedy or penalty authorized by law, if any
39 person, including, without limitation, a public body, violates certain provisions
40 relating to public works in the amount of not more than $5,000 for each such
41 violation. (NRS 338.015) Section 3 of this bill limits the existing maximum penalty
42 to the first violation and authorizes the imposition of an administrative penalty of
43 not less than $5,000 for each subsequent violation.
44 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for
45 a violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner
46 is authorized to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public
47 work: (1) for the first offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition
48 of the administrative penalty; and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a
49 period of 5 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
50 (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill instead provides for the issuance of a warning
51 for the first offense and revises the duration of the period of the disqualification as
52 follows: (1) for the second offense, a period of 180 days after the date of the
53 imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the third offense, a period of 1 year
54 after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; and (3) for the fourth
55 or subsequent offense, a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the
56 administrative penalty.
57 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
58 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and
59 determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
60 Commissioner of any such violations. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires
61 a public body, within 30 days after substantial completion of a contract for a public
62 work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and make a determination regarding any
63 violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works Compliance Division, which is
-
*AB502*

– 3 –
64 created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8 of this bill. Section 7
65 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of certain
66 laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
67 receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a
68 written report concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of
69 the report to the referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3)
70 perform any other duties related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
71 public works, as directed by the Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this
72 bill make conforming changes related to the creation of the Division.
73 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a
74 contractor on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of
75 certain laws relating to public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from
76 being withheld, retained or forfeited, except from the final payment, without a full
77 investigation being made by the awarding public body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5
78 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible offenses to the
79 Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the violation of
80 such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
81 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5
82 authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to
83 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer
84 possible violations to the Public Works Compliance Division within the prescribed
85 time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
86 violation of such provisions; and (2) an administrative penalty of $2,000 for each
87 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions.
88 Existing law requires that a person found to have willfully and repeatedly failed
89 to pay the prevailing wage required by law be required to pay certain damages to
90 each affected worker. (NRS 338.090) Section 6 of this bill removes the
91 requirement of willfulness, thus making the penalty applicable to a person who
92 repeatedly fails to pay the prevailing wage.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 338.01165 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 338.01165 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
4 chapter and except as otherwise provided in this section, a

9 to subsection 3, of the total hours of labor worked for each
10 apprenticed craft or type of work to be performed on those public
11 works.
12 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and
13 except as otherwise provided in this section, a contractor or

-
*AB502*

– 4 –
1 least 3 percent, or any increased percentage established pursuant to
2 subsection 3, of the total hours of labor worked for each apprenticed
3 craft or type of work to be performed on those public works.
4 3. On or after January 1, 2021, the Labor Commissioner, in
5 collaboration with the State Apprenticeship Council, may adopt
6 regulations to increase the percentage of total hours of labor
7 required to be performed by an apprentice pursuant to subsection 1
8 or 2 by not more than 2 percentage points.
9 4. An apprentice who graduates from an apprenticeship
10 program while employed on a public work shall:
11 (a) Be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes
12 of subsections 1 and 2.
13 (b) Be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes, including,
14 without limitation, the payment of wages or the payment of wages
15 and benefits to a journeyman covered by a collective bargaining
16 agreement.
17 5. If a contractor or subcontractor who is a signatory to a
18 collective bargaining agreement with a union that sponsors an
19 apprenticeship program for an apprenticed craft or type of work for
20 which the term of apprenticeship is not more than 3 years requests
21 an apprentice from that apprenticeship program and an apprentice in
22 the appropriate craft or type of work is not available, the contractor
23 or subcontractor may utilize a person who graduated from the
24 apprenticeship program in that craft or type of work within the 3
25 years immediately preceding the request from the contractor or
26 subcontractor. Such a person:
27 (a) Shall be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the
28 purposes of subsections 1 and 2.
29 (b) Shall be deemed a journeyman for all other purposes,
30 including, without limitation, the payment of wages and benefits to
31 a journeyman pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.
32 6. A contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work is
33 not required to use an apprentice in a craft or type of work
34 performed in a jurisdiction recognized by the State Apprenticeship
