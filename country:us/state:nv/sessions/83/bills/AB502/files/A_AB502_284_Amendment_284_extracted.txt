EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the compliance of
a contractor or subcontractor with certain requirements relating to
apprentices on a public work; revising requirements relating to
identifying numbers for public works; revising provisions relating to
the imposition of penalties for certain violations; revising provisions
relating to the period within which a person is disqualified from being
awarded a contract for a public work in certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to the investigation of certain possible violations;
creating the Public Works Compliance Division within the Office of
Labor Commissioner and prescribing its duties; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political subdivisions to
2 award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of specified projects that
3 are financed in whole or in part from public money, known as public works. (Chapter 338 of
4 NRS) Existing law creates the Office of Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor
5 Commissioner to enforce specified provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS
6 338.010-338.130, 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on
7 public works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
8 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to report certain
9 information regarding the public works for the previous year to the Labor Commissioner,
10 except identifying information about a public work or an apprentice or employee. Existing law
11 further requires a contractor or subcontractor on a public work to maintain and provide to the
12 Labor Commissioner any supporting documentation to show that the contractor or
13 subcontractor made a good faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a
14 good faith effort includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice:
15 (1) not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin work
16 on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on a
17 public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to
Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 4
18 resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165) Section 1 of this bill removes the 10-day
19 time limitation on requesting an apprentice, thereby allowing for an apprentice to be requested
20 by a contractor or subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is scheduled to
21 begin or resume. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting identifying
22 information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such information to the
23 Labor Commissioner.
24 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to: (1) request
25 an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the number in any
26 advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the Labor Commissioner the
27 award of a contract within 10 days after the award and subsequently report the completion of
28 the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013) Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body
29 request such an identifying number not less than [10] 3 business days before any
30 advertisement or other type of solicitation for the public work is published or made, as
31 applicable. Section 2 also [imposes] authorizes a penalty for each calendar day or portion
32 thereof that a public body is not in compliance with the reporting requirements.
33 [Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose an administrative penalty, in
34 addition to any other remedy or penalty authorized by law, if any person, including, without
35 limitation, a public body, violates certain provisions relating to public works in the amount of
36 not more than $5,000 for each such violation. (NRS 338.015) Section 3 of this bill limits the
37 existing maximum penalty to the first violation and authorizes the imposition of an
38 administrative penalty of not less than $5,000 for each subsequent violation.]
39 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for a
40 violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner is authorized
41 to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public work: (1) for the first
42 offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty;
43 and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a period of 5 years after the date of the
44 imposition of the administrative penalty. (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill instead provides
45 for the issuance of a warning for the first offense and revises the duration of the period of the
46 disqualification as follows: (1) for the second offense, a period of 180 days after the date of
47 the imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the third offense, a period of 1 year after
48 the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; and (3) for the fourth or subsequent
49 offense, a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
50 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
51 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and determine whether
52 a violation has been committed and inform the Labor Commissioner of any such violations.
53 (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires a public body, within [30] 90 days after
54 substantial completion of a contract for a public work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and
55 make a determination regarding any violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works
56 Compliance Division, which is created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8
57 of this bill. Section 7 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of
58 certain laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
59 receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report
60 concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of the report to the
61 referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3) perform any other duties
62 related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to public works, as directed by the
63 Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
64 creation of the Division.
65 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a contractor
66 on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of certain laws relating to
67 public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from being withheld, retained or forfeited,
68 except from the final payment, without a full investigation being made by the awarding public
69 body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible
70 offenses to the Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the
71 violation of such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
72 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5 authorizes the
73 Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to investigate possible
74 violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer possible violations to the Public
75 Works Compliance Division within the prescribed time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each
76 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions; and (2) an
Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 5
77 administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation
78 of such provisions. Section 5 also prohibits a public body from withholding from any
79 contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor
80 or subcontractor in order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body
81 by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 5.
82 [Existing law requires that a person found to have willfully and repeatedly failed to pay
83 the prevailing wage required by law be required to pay certain damages to each affected
84 worker. (NRS 338.090) Section 6 of this bill removes the requirement of willfulness, thus
85 making the penalty applicable to a person who repeatedly fails to pay the prevailing wage.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 338.01165 is hereby amended to read as follows:

15 performed on those public works.
16 3. On or after January 1, 2021, the Labor Commissioner, in collaboration with
17 the State Apprenticeship Council, may adopt regulations to increase the percentage
18 of total hours of labor required to be performed by an apprentice pursuant to
19 subsection 1 or 2 by not more than 2 percentage points.
20 4. An apprentice who graduates from an apprenticeship program while

28 bargaining agreement with a union that sponsors an apprenticeship program for an
29 apprenticed craft or type of work for which the term of apprenticeship is not more
30 than 3 years requests an apprentice from that apprenticeship program and an
31 apprentice in the appropriate craft or type of work is not available, the contractor or
32 subcontractor may utilize a person who graduated from the apprenticeship program
33 in that craft or type of work within the 3 years immediately preceding the request
34 from the contractor or subcontractor. Such a person:
35 (a) Shall be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes of

16 the public work.
17 (2) If the apprenticeship program does not provide an apprentice for the

21 period that the contractor or subcontractor is working on the public work. If a
22 contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on the public work, the
23 contractor or subcontractor shall submit an additional request each time that the
24 contractor or subcontractor resumes work on the public work [not earlier than 10
25 days] before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the
26 public work and not later than 5 days after the contractor or subcontractor actually
27 resumes work on the public work. The requirement for the submission of an
28 additional request in this subparagraph does not apply whenever a contractor or

19 and the Attorney General may prosecute the person in accordance with law.]
20 (Deleted by amendment.)
21 Sec. 4. NRS 338.017 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 338.017 1. If any administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this chapter

28 (2) Whether the worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her ethnicity;
29 and
30 (b) For each response the contractor or subcontractor receives pursuant to
31 paragraph (a):
32 (1) If the worker chose voluntarily to specify his or her gender or ethnicity,
33 or both, record the worker’s responses; and
34 (2) If the worker declined to specify his or her gender or ethnicity, or both,
35 record that the worker declined to specify such information.
36  A contractor or subcontractor shall not compel or coerce a worker to specify his
37 or her gender or ethnicity and shall not penalize or otherwise take any adverse
38 action against a worker who declines to specify his or her gender or ethnicity.
39 Before inquiring as to whether a worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her
40 gender or ethnicity, the applicable contractor or subcontractor must inform the
41 worker that such information, if provided, will be open to public inspection as set
42 forth in subsection 6.
43 5. A contractor engaged on a public work and each subcontractor engaged on
44 the public work shall keep or cause to be kept:
45 (a) An accurate record showing, for each worker employed by the contractor or
46 subcontractor in connection with the public work:
47 (1) The name of the worker;
48 (2) The occupation of the worker;
49 (3) The gender of the worker, if the worker voluntarily agreed to specify
50 that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an entry indicating that the worker
51 declined to specify such information;
Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 11
1 (4) The ethnicity of the worker, if the worker voluntarily agreed to specify
2 that information pursuant to subsection 4, or an entry indicating that the worker
3 declined to specify such information;
4 (5) If the worker has a driver’s license or identification card, an indication
5 of the state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or card; and
6 (6) The actual per diem, wages and benefits paid to the worker; and
7 (b) An additional accurate record showing, for each worker employed by the
8 contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work who has a driver’s
9 license or identification card:
10 (1) The name of the worker;
11 (2) The driver’s license number or identification card number of the
12 worker; and
13 (3) The state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or card.
14 6. The records maintained pursuant to subsection 5 must be open at all
15 reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body awarding the contract. The
16 contractor engaged on the public work or subcontractor engaged on the public work
17 shall ensure that a copy of each record for each calendar month is received by the
18 public body awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the month.
19 The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5 must
20 be open to public inspection as provided in NRS 239.010. The copy of the record
21 maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 5 is confidential and not open to
22 public inspection. The records in the possession of the public body awarding the
23 contract may be discarded by the public body 2 years after final payment is made
24 by the public body for the public work. The Labor Commissioner shall adopt
25 regulations authorizing and prescribing the procedures for the electronic filing of
26 the copies of the records required to be provided monthly by a contractor or
27 subcontractor to a public body pursuant to this subsection.
28 7. A contractor engaged on a public work shall not withhold from a
29 subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums necessary to cover any
30 penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld
31 from the contractor by the public body awarding the contract because the public
32 body did not receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor pursuant
33 to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified in subsection 6 if:
34 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission to the public
35 body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later than the later of:
36 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
37 (2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor; and
38 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the public body by
39 the time specified in subsection 6.
40  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from submitting a copy of a
41 record for a calendar month directly to the public body by the time specified in
42 subsection 6.
43 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative thereof,
44 performing work for a public work who neglects to comply with the provisions of
45 this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
46 9. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a public body has failed to comply
47 with the requirements of subsection 1, the Labor Commissioner [shall] may
48 impose against the public body:
49 (a) A fee of $1,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in
50 violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, on the public
51 work; and
Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 12
1 (b) An administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or subcontractor
2 found to be in violation of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive,
3 on the public work.
4 10. A public body shall not withhold from a contractor or subcontractor
5 engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor or subcontractor in
6 order to recover any fee or penalty assessed by the Labor Commissioner pursuant
7 to subsection 9.
8 11. As used in this section, “substantial completion” means that the
9 construction of a public work is, in accordance with the contract documents,
10 sufficiently complete that the owner can occupy and use the public work as
11 intended.
12 Sec. 6. [NRS 338.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 338.090 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, any person,
14 including the officers, agents or employees of a public body, who violates any
15 provision of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive, or any regulation adopted pursuant
16 thereto, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
17 2. The Labor Commissioner, in addition to any other remedy or penalty
18 provided in this chapter:
19 (a) Shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, assess a person who,
20 after an opportunity for a hearing, is found to have failed to pay the prevailing wage
21 required pursuant to NRS 338.020 to 338.090, inclusive, an amount equal to the
22 difference between the prevailing wages required to be paid and the wages that the
23 contractor or subcontractor actually paid;
24 (b) Shall require a person found to have [willfully and] repeatedly failed to pay
25 the prevailing wage required pursuant to NRS 338.020 to 338.090, inclusive, to pay
26 damages to each affected worker in an amount equal to the difference between the
27 prevailing wages required to be paid and the wages that the contractor or
28 subcontractor actually paid to the worker; and
29 (c) May, in addition to any other administrative penalty, impose an
30 administrative penalty not to exceed the costs incurred by the Labor Commissioner
31 to investigate and prosecute the matter.
32 3. If the Labor Commissioner finds that a person has failed to pay the
33 prevailing wage required pursuant to NRS 338.020 to 338.090, inclusive, the public
34 body may, in addition to any other remedy or penalty provided in this chapter,
35 require the person to pay the actual costs incurred by the public body to investigate
36 the matter.
37 4. The Labor Commissioner is not required to assess a person an amount
38 equal to the difference between the prevailing wages required to be paid and the
39 wages that the contractor or subcontractor actually paid if the contractor or
40 subcontractor has already paid that amount to a worker pursuant to paragraph (c) of
41 subsection 4 of NRS 338.035.
42 5. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to a subcontractor specified in
43 NRS 338.072.] (Deleted by amendment.)
44 Sec. 7. Chapter 607 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
45 section to read as follows:
46 The Public Works Compliance Division shall:
47 1. At the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon receipt of a referral
48 made by a public body pursuant to NRS 338.070:
49 (a) Investigate possible violations of the provisions of NRS 338.010 to
50 338.090, inclusive; and
51 (b) Submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report concerning an
52 investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (a). If the investigation was
Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 13
1 conducted pursuant to a referral made by a public body pursuant to NRS
2 338.070, a copy of the report must be provided to the public body.
3 2. Perform any other duties related to the enforcement of NRS 338.010 to
4 338.130, inclusive, as directed by the Labor Commissioner.
5 Sec. 8. NRS 607.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 607.010 The Office of Labor Commissioner is hereby created. The Office
7 consists of the Labor Commissioner and the Public Works Compliance Division.
8 Sec. 9. NRS 607.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
9 607.060 The Labor Commissioner may employ:
10 1. One Chief Assistant, who is in the unclassified service of the State.
11 2. Stenographic, clerical and statistical assistance.
12 3. Any personnel necessary to carry out the duties of the Public Works
13 Compliance Division.
14 Sec. 10. NRS 607.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 607.130 Upon the written request of the Office of Labor Commissioner, all
16 state and county officers shall furnish all information in their power necessary to
17 assist in carrying out the objects of this chapter.
18 Sec. 11. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
19 2. Sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of this act become effective:
20 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
21 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
22 out the provisions of this act; and
23 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public works. (BDR 28-401)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions relating to the compliance of
a contractor or subcontractor with certain requirements relating to
apprentices on a public work; revising requirements relating to
identifying numbers for public works; revising provisions relating to
the imposition of penalties for certain violations; revising provisions
relating to the period within which a person is disqualified from being
awarded a contract for a public work in certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to the investigation of certain possible violations;
creating the Public Works Compliance Division within the Office of
Labor Commissioner and prescribing its duties; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the State and its political subdivisions to
2 award a contract for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of specified projects that
3 are financed in whole or in part from public money, known as public works. (Chapter 338 of
4 NRS) Existing law creates the Office of Labor Commissioner and requires the Labor
5 Commissioner to enforce specified provisions relating to employment on public works. (NRS
6 338.010-338.130, 607.010) Existing law requires contractors or subcontractors engaged on
7 public works to use apprentices for a certain percentage of the total hours performed on a
8 public work, depending on certain conditions related to the public work, and to report certain
9 information regarding the public works for the previous year to the Labor Commissioner,
10 except identifying information about a public work or an apprentice or employee. Existing law
11 further requires a contractor or subcontractor on a public work to maintain and provide to the
12 Labor Commissioner any supporting documentation to show that the contractor or
13 subcontractor made a good faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirement. Such a
14 good faith effort includes submitting to an apprenticeship program a request for an apprentice:
15 (1) not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to begin work
16 on the public work; and (2) if a contractor or subcontractor does not work continuously on a
17 public work, not earlier than 10 days before the contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to

Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 4
18 resume work on the public work. (NRS 338.01165) Section 1 of this bill removes the 10-day
19 time limitation on requesting an apprentice, thereby allowing for an apprentice to be requested
20 by a contractor or subcontractor at any time before work on a public work is scheduled to
21 begin or resume. Section 1 also removes the exception for not reporting identifying
22 information about a public work, thereby requiring the reporting of such information to the
23 Labor Commissioner.
24 Existing law, in part, requires a public body that undertakes a public work to: (1) request
25 an identifying number with a designation of the work and include the number in any
26 advertisement or other type of solicitation; and (2) report to the Labor Commissioner the
27 award of a contract within 10 days after the award and subsequently report the completion of
28 the work under the contract. (NRS 338.013) Section 2 of this bill requires that a public body
29 request such an identifying number not less than [10] 3 business days before any
30 advertisement or other type of solicitation for the public work is published or made, as
31 applicable. Section 2 also [imposes] authorizes a penalty for each calendar day or portion
32 thereof that a public body is not in compliance with the reporting requirements.
33 [Existing law authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose an administrative penalty, in
34 addition to any other remedy or penalty authorized by law, if any person, including, without
35 limitation, a public body, violates certain provisions relating to public works in the amount of
36 not more than $5,000 for each such violation. (NRS 338.015) Section 3 of this bill limits the
37 existing maximum penalty to the first violation and authorizes the imposition of an
38 administrative penalty of not less than $5,000 for each subsequent violation.]
39 Under existing law, if an administrative penalty is imposed against a person for a
40 violation of certain provisions relating to public works, the Labor Commissioner is authorized
41 to prohibit the person from being awarded a contract for a public work: (1) for the first
42 offense, for a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty;
43 and (2) for the second or subsequent offense, for a period of 5 years after the date of the
44 imposition of the administrative penalty. (NRS 338.017) Section 4 of this bill instead provides
45 for the issuance of a warning for the first offense and revises the duration of the period of the
46 disqualification as follows: (1) for the second offense, a period of 180 days after the date of
47 the imposition of the administrative penalty; (2) for the third offense, a period of 1 year after
48 the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty; and (3) for the fourth or subsequent
49 offense, a period of 3 years after the date of the imposition of the administrative penalty.
50 Existing law requires any public body awarding a contract for a public work to
51 investigate possible violations of certain laws relating to public works and determine whether
52 a violation has been committed and inform the Labor Commissioner of any such violations.
53 (NRS 338.070) Section 5 of this bill requires a public body, within [30] 90 days after
54 substantial completion of a contract for a public work, to: (1) conduct an investigation and
55 make a determination regarding any violation; or (2) refer the matter to the Public Works
56 Compliance Division, which is created within the Office of Labor Commissioner in section 8
57 of this bill. Section 7 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) investigate possible violations of
58 certain laws relating to public works at the direction of the Labor Commissioner or upon
59 receipt of a referral from a public body; (2) submit to the Labor Commissioner a written report
60 concerning such an investigation and, if applicable, provide a copy of the report to the
61 referring public body upon completion of the investigation; and (3) perform any other duties
62 related to the enforcement of certain provisions relating to public works, as directed by the
63 Labor Commissioner. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
64 creation of the Division.
65 Existing law requires a public body to withhold and retain from payments to a contractor
66 on a public work sums that are forfeited as a result of the violation of certain laws relating to
67 public works. Existing law also prohibits any sums from being withheld, retained or forfeited,
68 except from the final payment, without a full investigation being made by the awarding public
69 body. (NRS 338.070) Section 5 requires a public body who refers the investigation of possible
70 offenses to the Division to withhold and retain all sums believed to be forfeited by the
71 violation of such laws until an investigation has been completed by the Division and the Labor
72 Commissioner has determined if any violations were committed. Section 5 authorizes the
73 Labor Commissioner to impose against a public body that fails to investigate possible
74 violations of certain laws relating to a public work or refer possible violations to the Public
75 Works Compliance Division within the prescribed time period: (1) a fee of $1,000 for each
76 contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation of such provisions; and (2) an

Assembly Amendment No. 284 to Assembly Bill No. 502 Page 5
77 administrative penalty of $2,000 for each contractor or subcontractor found to be in violation
78 of such provisions. Section 5 also prohibits a public body from withholding from any
79 contractor or subcontractor engaged on a public work any amount due to the contractor
80 or subcontractor in order to recover any fee or penalty assessed against the public body
81 by the Labor Commissioner pursuant to section 5.
82 [Existing law requires that a person found to have willfully and repeatedly failed to pay
83 the prevailing wage required by law be required to pay certain damages to each affected
84 worker. (NRS 338.090) Section 6 of this bill removes the requirement of willfulness, thus
85 making the penalty applicable to a person who repeatedly fails to pay the prevailing wage.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 338.01165 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 338.01165 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and
3 except as otherwise provided in this section, a contractor or subcontractor engaged
4 in vertical construction who employs workers on one or more public works during a
5 calendar year pursuant to NRS 338.040 shall use one or more apprentices for at
6 least 10 percent, or any increased percentage established pursuant to subsection 3,
7 of the total hours of labor worked for each apprenticed craft or type of work to be
8 performed on those public works.
9 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and except as
10 otherwise provided in this section, a contractor or subcontractor engaged in
11 horizontal construction who employs workers on one or more public works during a
12 calendar year pursuant to NRS 338.040 shall use one or more apprentices for at
13 least 3 percent, or any increased percentage established pursuant to subsection 3, of
14 the total hours of labor worked for each apprenticed craft or type of work to be
15 performed on those public works.
16 3. On or after January 1, 2021, the Labor Commissioner, in collaboration with
17 the State Apprenticeship Council, may adopt regulations to increase the percentage
18 of total hours of labor required to be performed by an apprentice pursuant to
19 subsection 1 or 2 by not more than 2 percentage points.
20 4. An apprentice who graduates from an apprenticeship program while
21 employed on a public work shall:
22 (a) Be deemed an apprentice on the public work for the purposes of

36 the matter.
37 4. The Labor Commissioner is not required to assess a person an amount
