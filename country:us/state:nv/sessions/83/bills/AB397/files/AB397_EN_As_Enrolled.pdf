CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions governing
certain waivers of fees provided by the Board of Regents of
the University of Nevada; revising the criteria of eligibility
for a waiver of fees by the Board of Regents for certain
persons who are or were unaccompanied for a certain period
of time; revising the criteria of eligibility for a waiver of fees
by the Board of Regents for certain Native American
students; providing for the continuity of waivers previously
provided for certain Native American students; repealing
certain provisions requiring the Chancellor of the Nevada
System of Higher Education to cause to be analyzed certain
natural materials upon the request of a resident of this State;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of
the University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including
registration and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law
generally requires those students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents
to maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and
prescribes certain other qualifications of eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS
396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5446, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections
1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize provisions and qualifications for each waiver that the
Board of Regents may grant to certain students. Specifically, sections 1.1-1.4 and
1.6 require the amount of each waiver to be equal to the full balance of registration
fees, laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees assessed against a student after all
scholarships, grants and other financial assistance, not including loans, to which the
student is entitled for that semester are applied to the balance of such fees owed by
the student for the semester. Section 1.5 establishes a similar requirement for a
waiver of not less than half of all registration fees, laboratory fees and all other
mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may waive for a veteran enrolled in
certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8 require each student
seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver, complete:
(1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form for
financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student
is ineligible under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student
Aid. Sections 1.1-1.8 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain
cumulative grade point average with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver
is granted meet satisfactory academic progress, as determined by the school in
which the student is enrolled.
Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration
fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or
unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section 1.6 of this bill requires, rather than
authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a
person is required to meet to qualify for the waiver. Specifically, section 1.6
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
requires that a person: (1) be 25 years of age or less when the person enrolls in the
Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) for a period of not less than 6 months at
any time after the person attained the age of 13 years have been an unaccompanied
youth and, during that period, have been homeless or self-supporting and at risk of
becoming homeless. Section 1.6 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled
in an undergraduate degree program at a school within the System.
Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a
person requesting such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required
to qualify for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section 1.6 requires, rather than
authorizes, the Board of Regents to request documentation to verify that the person
was an unaccompanied youth and homeless or self-supporting and at risk of
becoming homeless for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining 13 years of
age.
Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees,
laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a
member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant
of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide
resident of this State; (2) a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an
Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this
State; or (3) has been a resident of this State for not less than 1 year and is currently
a resident on qualified tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is located
within or outside of this State. (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to
qualify for the waiver, a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or
a certified descendant of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation must:
(1) be a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation,
all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this State, regardless of
whether the actual residence of the person is located within or outside of the
boundaries of this State; (2) have graduated from a high school in this State; (3)
have successfully completed a high school equivalency assessment which was
selected by the State Board of Education and administered in this State; (4) be
currently enrolled in a high school in this State; or (5) be a descendant of a person
who formerly attended the Stewart Indian School.
Section 3 of this bill makes the changes made by sections 1.6 and 1.8 to the
waivers for unaccompanied youth and Native American students, respectively,
effective on July 1, 2026, and July 1, 2025, respectively. Section 1.9 of this bill
requires the Board of Regents to continue providing a waiver of fees for certain
Native American students through July 1, 2030 to a student who: (1) received the
waiver between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2026; (2) as of July 1, 2026, is enrolled in
the System; and (3) who would otherwise be eligible to continue receiving the
waiver, based on the criteria and conditions established for the waiver in effect as
of July 1, 2024.
Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate
person employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken
from within the boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any
resident of this State for the purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS
396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals this requirement.
