AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions governing
certain waivers of fees provided by the Board of Regents
of the University of Nevada; revising the criteria of
eligibility for a waiver of fees by the Board of Regents for
certain persons who are or were unaccompanied for a
certain period of time; revising the criteria of eligibility

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of
2 the University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including
3 registration and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law
4 generally requires those students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents
5 to maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and
6 prescribes certain other qualifications of eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS
7 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5446, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections
8 1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize provisions and qualifications for each waiver that the
9 Board of Regents may grant to certain students. Specifically, sections 1.1-1.4 and
-
*AB397_R2*
– 2 –
10 1.6 require the amount of each waiver to be equal to the full balance of registration
11 fees, laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees assessed against a student after all
12 scholarships, grants and other financial assistance, not including loans, to which the
13 student is entitled for that semester are applied to the balance of such fees owed by
14 the student for the semester. Section 1.5 establishes a similar requirement for a
15 waiver of not less than half of all registration fees, laboratory fees and all other
16 mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may waive for a veteran enrolled in
17 certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8 require each student
18 seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver, complete:
19 (1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form for
20 financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student
21 is ineligible under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student
22 Aid. Sections 1.1-1.8 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain
23 cumulative grade point average with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver
24 is granted meet satisfactory academic progress, as determined by the school in
25 which the student is enrolled.
26 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration
27 fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or
28 unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section 1.6 of this bill requires, rather than
29 authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a
30 person is required to meet to qualify for the waiver. Specifically, section 1.6
31 requires that a person: (1) be 25 years of age or less when the person enrolls in the
32 Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) for a period of not less than 6 months at
33 any time after the person attained the age of 13 years have been an unaccompanied
34 youth and, during that period, have been homeless or self-supporting and at risk of
35 becoming homeless. Section 1.6 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled
36 in an undergraduate degree program at a school within the System.
37 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a
38 person requesting such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required
39 to qualify for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section 1.6 requires, rather than
40 authorizes, the Board of Regents to request documentation to verify that the person
41 was an unaccompanied youth and homeless or self-supporting and at risk of
42 becoming homeless for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining 13 years of
43 age.
44 Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees,
45 laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a
46 member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant
47 of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide
48 resident of this State; (2) a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an
49 Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this
50 State; or (3) has been a resident of this State for not less than 1 year and is currently
51 a resident on qualified tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is located
52 within or outside of this State. (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to
53 qualify for the waiver, a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or
54 a certified descendant of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation must:
55 (1) be a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation,
56 all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this State, regardless of
57 whether the actual residence of the person is located within or outside of the
58 boundaries of this State; (2) have graduated from a high school in this State; (3)
59 have successfully completed a high school equivalency assessment which was
60 selected by the State Board of Education and administered in this State; (4) be
61 currently enrolled in a high school in this State; or (5) be a descendant of a person
62 who formerly attended the Stewart Indian School.
63 Section 3 of this bill makes the changes made by sections 1.6 and 1.8 to the
64 waivers for unaccompanied youth and Native American students, respectively,
-
*AB397_R2*
– 3 –
65 effective on July 1, 2026, and July 1, 2025, respectively. Section 1.9 of this bill
66 requires the Board of Regents to continue providing a waiver of fees for certain
67 Native American students through July 1, 2030 to a student who: (1) received the
68 waiver between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2026; (2) as of July 1, 2026, is enrolled in
69 the System; and (3) who would otherwise be eligible to continue receiving the
70 waiver, based on the criteria and conditions established for the waiver in effect as
71 of July 1, 2024.
72 Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate
73 person employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken
74 from within the boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any
75 resident of this State for the purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS
76 396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals this requirement.

JOINT SPONSOR: SENATOR TAYLOR
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to higher education.
(BDR 34-653)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions governing
certain waivers of fees provided by the Board of Regents
of the University of Nevada; revising the criteria of
eligibility for a waiver of fees by the Board of Regents for
certain persons who are or were unaccompanied for a
certain period of time; revising the criteria of eligibility
for a waiver of fees by the Board of Regents for certain
Native American students; providing for the continuity of
waivers previously provided for certain Native American
students; repealing certain provisions requiring the
Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education to
cause to be analyzed certain natural materials upon the
request of a resident of this State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of
2 the University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including
3 registration and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law
4 generally requires those students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents
5 to maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and
6 prescribes certain other qualifications of eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS
7 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5446, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections
8 1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize provisions and qualifications for each waiver that the
9 Board of Regents may grant to certain students. Specifically, sections 1.1-1.4 and
-
*AB397_R2*

– 2 –
10 1.6 require the amount of each waiver to be equal to the full balance of registration
11 fees, laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees assessed against a student after all
12 scholarships, grants and other financial assistance, not including loans, to which the
13 student is entitled for that semester are applied to the balance of such fees owed by
14 the student for the semester. Section 1.5 establishes a similar requirement for a
15 waiver of not less than half of all registration fees, laboratory fees and all other
16 mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may waive for a veteran enrolled in
17 certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8 require each student
18 seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver, complete:
19 (1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form for
20 financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student
21 is ineligible under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student
22 Aid. Sections 1.1-1.8 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain
23 cumulative grade point average with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver
24 is granted meet satisfactory academic progress, as determined by the school in
25 which the student is enrolled.
26 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration
27 fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or
28 unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section 1.6 of this bill requires, rather than
29 authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a
30 person is required to meet to qualify for the waiver. Specifically, section 1.6
31 requires that a person: (1) be 25 years of age or less when the person enrolls in the
32 Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) for a period of not less than 6 months at
33 any time after the person attained the age of 13 years have been an unaccompanied
34 youth and, during that period, have been homeless or self-supporting and at risk of
35 becoming homeless. Section 1.6 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled
36 in an undergraduate degree program at a school within the System.
37 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a
38 person requesting such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required
39 to qualify for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section 1.6 requires, rather than
40 authorizes, the Board of Regents to request documentation to verify that the person
41 was an unaccompanied youth and homeless or self-supporting and at risk of
42 becoming homeless for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining 13 years of
43 age.
44 Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees,
45 laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a
46 member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant
47 of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide
48 resident of this State; (2) a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an
49 Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this
50 State; or (3) has been a resident of this State for not less than 1 year and is currently
51 a resident on qualified tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is located
52 within or outside of this State. (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to
53 qualify for the waiver, a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or
