Nevada; revising the criteria of eligibility for a waiver of fees by the
Board of Regents for certain persons who are or were unaccompanied
for a certain period of time; revising the criteria of eligibility for a

[to] for certain Native American students ; [who are identified as
homeless or unaccompanied pupils;] repealing certain provisions
requiring the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education to
cause to be analyzed certain natural materials upon the request of a
resident of this State; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of the
2 University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including registration
3 and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law generally requires those
4 students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents to maintain a cumulative grade
5 point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and prescribes certain other qualifications of
6 eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5446,
7 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections 1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize provisions and qualifications for
8 each waiver that the Board of Regents may grant to certain students. Specifically, sections
9 1.1-1.4 and 1.6 require the amount of each waiver to be equal to the full balance of
10 registration fees, laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees assessed against a student after
11 all scholarships, grants and other financial assistance, not including loans, to which the student
12 is entitled for that semester are applied to the balance of such fees owed by the student for the
13 semester. Section 1.5 establishes a similar requirement for a waiver of not less than half of all
14 registration fees, laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may
15 waive for a veteran enrolled in certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8
16 require each student seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver,

Senate Amendment No. 989 to Assembly Bill No. 397 First Reprint Page 4
17 complete: (1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form for
18 financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student is ineligible
19 under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Sections 1.1-1.8
20 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain cumulative grade point average
21 with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver is granted meet satisfactory academic
22 progress, as determined by the school in which the student is enrolled.
23 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration fees and
24 laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or unaccompanied pupil. (NRS
25 396.5448). Section [1.7] 1.6 of this bill requires, rather than authorizes, the Board of Regents
26 to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a person is required to meet to qualify for the
27 waiver. Specifically, section [1.7] 1.6 requires that a person: (1) be 25 years of age or less
28 when the person enrolls in the Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) for a period of not
29 less than 6 months at any time after the person attained the age of 13 years [, but before
30 attaining the age of 25 years, was] have been an unaccompanied youth and , [who,] during
31 that period, [was also] have been homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming
32 homeless. Section [1.7] 1.6 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled in an
33 undergraduate degree program at a school within the System.
34 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a person
35 requesting such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required to qualify for the
36 waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section [1.7] 1.6 requires, rather than authorizes, the Board of
37 Regents to request documentation to verify that the person was an unaccompanied youth and
38 homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless for a period of not less than 6
39 months after attaining 13 years of age . [, but before attaining 25 years of age. Section 3 of this
40 bill makes the changes made to this waiver by section 1.7 effective on July 1, 2026. Section
41 1.9 of this bill requires the Board of Regents to continue providing a waiver of fees through
42 July 1, 2030, to a student who received the waiver between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2026, and
43 as of July 1, 2026, is enrolled in the System and who would otherwise be eligible to continue
44 receiving the waiver, based on the criteria established for the waiver in effect on July 1, 2025.]
45 Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees, laboratory fees
46 and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a member of a federally
47 recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant of an enrolled member of such
48 an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide resident of this State; (2) a member or
49 descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located
50 within the boundaries of this State; or (3) has been a resident of this State for not less than 1
51 year and is currently a resident on qualified tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is
52 located within or outside of this State. (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to
53 qualify for the waiver, a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or a certified
54 descendant of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation must: (1) [be a bona fide
55 resident of this State; (2)] be a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian
56 tribe or nation, all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this State, [and]
57 regardless of whether the actual residence of the person is located within or outside of
58 the boundaries of this State; (2) have graduated from a high school in this State; [or] (3)
59 [currently be a resident on qualified tribal land, regardless of whether the person is a resident
60 of this State and regardless of whether the actual residence of the person is located within the
61 boundaries of this State.] have successfully completed a high school equivalency
62 assessment which was selected by the State Board of Education and administered in this
63 State; (4) be currently enrolled in a high school in this State; or (5) be a descendant of a
64 person who formerly attended the Stewart Indian School.
65 Section 3 of this bill makes the changes made by sections 1.6 and 1.8 to the waivers
66 for unaccompanied youth and Native American students, respectively, effective on July
67 1, 2025. Section 1.9 of this bill requires the Board of Regents to continue providing a
68 waiver of fees for certain Native American students through July 1, 2030 to a student
69 who: (1) received the waiver between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2026; (2) as of July 1,
70 2026, is enrolled in the System; and (3) who would otherwise be eligible to continue
71 receiving the waiver, based on the criteria and conditions established for the waiver in
72 effect as of July 1, 2024.
73 Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate person
74 employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken from within the
75 boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any resident of this State for the

Senate Amendment No. 989 to Assembly Bill No. 397 First Reprint Page 5
76 purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS 396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals
77 this requirement.
