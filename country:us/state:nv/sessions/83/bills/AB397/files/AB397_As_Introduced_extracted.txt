EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions governing
the waiver of fees by the Board of Regents of the
University of Nevada for certain persons who have
experienced homelessness; repealing certain provisions
requiring the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher
Education to cause to be analyzed certain natural
materials upon the request of a resident of this State; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to
2 grant a waiver of registration fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified
3 as a homeless or unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section 1 of this bill
4 requires, rather than authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and
5 revises the criteria that a person is required to meet to qualify for the waiver.
6 Specifically, section 1 requires that a person: (1) be 25 years of age or less when
7 the person enrolls in the Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) have experienced
8 homelessness for a period of not less than 6 months at any time after the person
9 attained the age of 12 years, but before attaining the age of 25 years; and (3) during
10 that period, have received services from certain agencies or organizations in this
11 State whose purpose is to provide services to young persons experiencing
12 homelessness. Section 1 requires a person who is seeking the waiver to complete
13 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and provides for the adjustment of the
14 amount of the waiver based on the amount of federal educational benefits the
15 person receives. Section 1 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled in an
16 undergraduate degree program at a school within the System.
17 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a
18 person requesting the waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required to
19 qualify for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section 1 requires, rather than authorizes,
20 the Board of Regents to request documentation to verify that the person has
-

21 experienced homelessness for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining 12
22 years of age, but before attaining 25 years of age. Section 1 also requires the Board
23 of Regents to request certain documentation to verify that the person received
24 services from certain agencies or organizations based in this State while the person
25 was experiencing homelessness.
26 Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate
27 person employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken
28 from within the boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any
29 resident of this State for the purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS
30 396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals this requirement.
