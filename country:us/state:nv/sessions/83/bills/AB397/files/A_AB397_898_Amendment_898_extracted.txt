~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions governing [the waiver]
certain waivers of fees provided by the Board of Regents of the
University of Nevada ; revising the criteria of eligibility for a waiver
of fees by the Board of Regents for [certain] persons who [have
experienced homelessness;] and or were unaccompanied for a
certain period of time; revising the criteria of eligibility for a
waiver of fees by the Board of Regents for certain Native American
students; providing for the continuity of waivers previously
provided to certain students who are identified as homeless or
unaccompanied pupils; repealing certain provisions requiring the
Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education to cause to be
analyzed certain natural materials upon the request of a resident of this
State; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of the
2 University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including
3 registration and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law generally
4 requires those students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents to maintain a
5 cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and prescribes certain other
6 qualifications of eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443,
7 396.5445, 396.5446, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections 1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize
8 provisions and qualifications for each waiver that the Board of Regents may grant to
9 certain students. Specifically, sections 1.1-1.4 and 1.6 require the amount of each waiver
10 to be equal to the full balance of registration fees, laboratory fees and all other
11 mandatory fees assessed against a student after all scholarships, grants and other
12 financial assistance, not including loans, to which the student is entitled for that semester
13 are applied to the balance of such fees owed by the student for the semester. Section 1.5
14 establishes a similar requirement for a waiver of not less than half of all registration fees,
15 laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may waive for a
16 veteran enrolled in certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8 require
17 each student seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver,
18 complete: (1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form
19 for financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student is
20 ineligible under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
Assembly Amendment No. 898 to Assembly Bill No. 397 Page 4
21 Sections 1.1-1.8 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain
22 cumulative grade point average with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver is
23 granted meet satisfactory academic progress, as determined by the school in which the
24 student is enrolled.
25 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents [of the University of Nevada] to grant a
26 waiver of registration fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or
27 unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section [1] 1.7 of this bill requires, rather than
28 authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a person is
29 required to meet to qualify for the waiver. Specifically, section [1] 1.7 requires that a person:
30 (1) be 25 years of age or less when the person enrolls in the Nevada System of Higher
31 Education; (2) [have experienced homelessness] for a period of not less than 6 months at any
32 time after the person attained the age of [12] 13 years, but before attaining the age of 25 years
33 [;] , was unaccompanied and [(3)] who, during that period [, have received services from
34 certain agencies or organizations in this State whose purpose is to provide services to young
35 persons experiencing homelessness. Section 1 requires a person who is seeking the waiver to
36 complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and provides for the adjustment of the
37 amount of the waiver based on the amount of federal educational benefits the person
38 receives.] , was also homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless.
39 Section [1] 1.7 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled in an undergraduate degree
40 program at a school within the System.
41 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a person
42 requesting [the] such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required to qualify
43 for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section [1] 1.7 requires, rather than authorizes, the Board of
44 Regents to request documentation to verify that the person [has experienced homelessness for]
45 was unaccompanied and homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless
46 for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining [12] 13 years of age, but before attaining
47 25 years of age. [Section 1 also requires the Board of Regents to request certain
48 documentation to verify that the person received services from certain agencies or
49 organizations based in this State while the person was experiencing homelessness.] Section 3
50 of this bill makes the changes made to this waiver by section 1.7 effective on July 1, 2026.
51 Section 1.9 of this bill requires the Board of Regents to continue providing a waiver of
52 fees through July 1, 2030, to a student who received the waiver between July 1, 2024, and
53 July 1, 2026, and as of July 1, 2026, is enrolled in the System and who would otherwise
54 be eligible to continue receiving the waiver, based on the criteria established for the
55 waiver in effect on July 1, 2025.
56 Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees, laboratory
57 fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a member of a
58 federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant of an enrolled
59 member of such an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide resident of this
60 State; (2) a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation,
61 all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this State; or (3) has been a
62 resident of this State for not less than 1 year and is currently a resident on qualified
63 tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is located within or outside of this State.
64 (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to qualify for the waiver, a member of
65 a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or a certified descendant of an enrolled
66 member of such an Indian tribe or nation must: (1) be a bona fide resident of this State;
67 (2) be a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation, all or
68 part of which is located within the boundaries of this State, and have graduated from a
69 high school in this State; or (3) currently be a resident on qualified tribal land,
70 regardless of whether the person is a resident of this State and regardless of whether the
71 actual residence of the person is located within the boundaries of this State,
72 Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate person
73 employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken from within the
74 boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any resident of this State for the
75 purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS 396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals
76 this requirement.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to higher education. (BDR 34-653)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions governing [the waiver]
certain waivers of fees provided by the Board of Regents of the
University of Nevada ; revising the criteria of eligibility for a waiver
of fees by the Board of Regents for [certain] persons who [have
experienced homelessness;] and or were unaccompanied for a
certain period of time; revising the criteria of eligibility for a
waiver of fees by the Board of Regents for certain Native American
students; providing for the continuity of waivers previously
provided to certain students who are identified as homeless or
unaccompanied pupils; repealing certain provisions requiring the
Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education to cause to be
analyzed certain natural materials upon the request of a resident of this
State; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of the
2 University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including
3 registration and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law generally
4 requires those students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents to maintain a
5 cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and prescribes certain other
6 qualifications of eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443,
7 396.5445, 396.5446, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections 1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize
8 provisions and qualifications for each waiver that the Board of Regents may grant to
9 certain students. Specifically, sections 1.1-1.4 and 1.6 require the amount of each waiver
10 to be equal to the full balance of registration fees, laboratory fees and all other
11 mandatory fees assessed against a student after all scholarships, grants and other
12 financial assistance, not including loans, to which the student is entitled for that semester
13 are applied to the balance of such fees owed by the student for the semester. Section 1.5
14 establishes a similar requirement for a waiver of not less than half of all registration fees,
15 laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may waive for a
16 veteran enrolled in certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8 require
17 each student seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver,
18 complete: (1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form
19 for financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student is
20 ineligible under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

Assembly Amendment No. 898 to Assembly Bill No. 397 Page 4
21 Sections 1.1-1.8 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain
22 cumulative grade point average with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver is
23 granted meet satisfactory academic progress, as determined by the school in which the
24 student is enrolled.
25 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents [of the University of Nevada] to grant a
26 waiver of registration fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or
27 unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section [1] 1.7 of this bill requires, rather than
28 authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a person is
29 required to meet to qualify for the waiver. Specifically, section [1] 1.7 requires that a person:
30 (1) be 25 years of age or less when the person enrolls in the Nevada System of Higher
31 Education; (2) [have experienced homelessness] for a period of not less than 6 months at any
32 time after the person attained the age of [12] 13 years, but before attaining the age of 25 years
33 [;] , was unaccompanied and [(3)] who, during that period [, have received services from
34 certain agencies or organizations in this State whose purpose is to provide services to young
35 persons experiencing homelessness. Section 1 requires a person who is seeking the waiver to
36 complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and provides for the adjustment of the
37 amount of the waiver based on the amount of federal educational benefits the person
38 receives.] , was also homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless.
39 Section [1] 1.7 also limits the waiver to persons who are enrolled in an undergraduate degree
40 program at a school within the System.
41 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a person
42 requesting [the] such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required to qualify
43 for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section [1] 1.7 requires, rather than authorizes, the Board of
44 Regents to request documentation to verify that the person [has experienced homelessness for]
45 was unaccompanied and homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless
46 for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining [12] 13 years of age, but before attaining
47 25 years of age. [Section 1 also requires the Board of Regents to request certain
48 documentation to verify that the person received services from certain agencies or
49 organizations based in this State while the person was experiencing homelessness.] Section 3
50 of this bill makes the changes made to this waiver by section 1.7 effective on July 1, 2026.
51 Section 1.9 of this bill requires the Board of Regents to continue providing a waiver of
52 fees through July 1, 2030, to a student who received the waiver between July 1, 2024, and
53 July 1, 2026, and as of July 1, 2026, is enrolled in the System and who would otherwise
54 be eligible to continue receiving the waiver, based on the criteria established for the
55 waiver in effect on July 1, 2025.
56 Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees, laboratory
57 fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a member of a
58 federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant of an enrolled
59 member of such an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide resident of this
60 State; (2) a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation,
61 all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this State; or (3) has been a
62 resident of this State for not less than 1 year and is currently a resident on qualified
63 tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is located within or outside of this State.
64 (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to qualify for the waiver, a member of
65 a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or a certified descendant of an enrolled
66 member of such an Indian tribe or nation must: (1) be a bona fide resident of this State;
67 (2) be a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation, all or
68 part of which is located within the boundaries of this State, and have graduated from a
69 high school in this State; or (3) currently be a resident on qualified tribal land,
70 regardless of whether the person is a resident of this State and regardless of whether the
71 actual residence of the person is located within the boundaries of this State,
72 Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate person
73 employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken from within the
74 boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any resident of this State for the
75 purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS 396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals
76 this requirement.
