Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, or in certain cases, requires the Board of Regents of
2 the University of Nevada to grant a waiver of the payment of certain fees, including
3 registration and laboratory fees, assessed against certain students. Existing law
4 generally requires those students who are granted a waiver by the Board of Regents
5 to maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 grading scale and
6 prescribes certain other qualifications of eligibility for each such waiver. (NRS
7 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5446, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections
8 1.1-1.8 of this bill standardize provisions and qualifications for each waiver that the
9 Board of Regents may grant to certain students. Specifically, sections 1.1-1.4 and
10 1.6 require the amount of each waiver to be equal to the full balance of registration
11 fees, laboratory fees and all other mandatory fees assessed against a student after all
12 scholarships, grants and other financial assistance, not including loans, to which the
-
*AB397_R1*

– 2 –
13 student is entitled for that semester are applied to the balance of such fees owed by
14 the student for the semester. Section 1.5 establishes a similar requirement for a
15 waiver of not less than half of all registration fees, laboratory fees and all other
16 mandatory fees that the Board of Regents may waive for a veteran enrolled in
17 certain graduate programs. (NRS 396.5446) Sections 1.1-1.8 require each student
18 seeking a waiver to, for each year for which the student seeks a waiver, complete:
19 (1) the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; or (2) an alternative form for
20 financial aid provided by the school in which the student is enrolled, if the student
21 is ineligible under federal law to complete the Free Application for Federal Student
22 Aid. Sections 1.1-1.8 also replace requirements that each student maintain a certain
23 cumulative grade point average with a requirement that a student to whom a waiver
24 is granted meet satisfactory academic progress, as determined by the school in
25 which the student is enrolled.
26 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration
27 fees and laboratory fees for a person who is identified as a homeless or
28 unaccompanied pupil. (NRS 396.5448). Section 1.7 of this bill requires, rather than
29 authorizes, the Board of Regents to grant the waiver and revises the criteria that a
30 person is required to meet to qualify for the waiver. Specifically, section 1.7
31 requires that a person: (1) be 25 years of age or less when the person enrolls in the
32 Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) for a period of not less than 6 months at
33 any time after the person attained the age of 13 years, but before attaining the age
34 of 25 years, was unaccompanied and who, during that period, was also homeless or
35 self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless. Section 1.7 also limits the
36 waiver to persons who are enrolled in an undergraduate degree program at a school
37 within the System.
38 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to request documentation from a
39 person requesting such a waiver to verify that the person meets the criteria required
40 to qualify for the waiver. (NRS 396.5448) Section 1.7 requires, rather than
41 authorizes, the Board of Regents to request documentation to verify that the person
42 was unaccompanied and homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming
43 homeless for a period of not less than 6 months after attaining 13 years of age, but
44 before attaining 25 years of age. Section 3 of this bill makes the changes made to
45 this waiver by section 1.7 effective on July 1, 2026. Section 1.9 of this bill requires
46 the Board of Regents to continue providing a waiver of fees through July 1, 2030,
47 to a student who received the waiver between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2026, and as
48 of July 1, 2026, is enrolled in the System and who would otherwise be eligible to
49 continue receiving the waiver, based on the criteria established for the waiver in
50 effect on July 1, 2025.
51 Existing law requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration fees,
52 laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student who is a
53 member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or certified as a descendant
54 of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation and who is: (1) a bona fide
55 resident of this State; (2) a member or descendant of an enrolled member of an
56 Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located within the boundaries of this
57 State; or (3) has been a resident of this State for not less than 1 year and is currently
58 a resident on qualified tribal land, whether his or her actual residence is located
59 within or outside of this State. (NRS 369.5449) Section 1.8 instead provides that, to
60 qualify for the waiver, a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation or
61 a certified descendant of an enrolled member of such an Indian tribe or nation must:
62 (1) be a bona fide resident of this State; (2) be a member or descendant of an
63 enrolled member of an Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located within
64 the boundaries of this State, and have graduated from a high school in this State; or
65 (3) currently be a resident on qualified tribal land, regardless of whether the person
66 is a resident of this State and regardless of whether the actual residence of the
67 person is located within the boundaries of this State.

68 Existing law requires the Chancellor of the System to direct an appropriate
69 person employed by the System to analyze any ores, minerals, soil or water taken
70 from within the boundaries of this State which are sent to the Chancellor by any
71 resident of this State for the purpose of performing such an analysis. (NRS
72 396.620-396.660) Section 2 of this bill repeals this requirement.
