EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state property; revising certain provisions
relating to the lease of certain state real property for
grazing or pasturage rights and the sale of agricultural
products produced on such real property; requiring certain
money received for the grazing of livestock and the sale
of agricultural products be deposited in the Account for
Maintenance of State Parks within the Division of State
Parks of the State Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the
2 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is authorized to lease
3 certain land owned by the State of Nevada for certain purposes, including for the
4 purpose of grazing livestock, and sets forth the manner in which the fee for the
5 lease of land for the grazing of livestock is determined. (NRS 322.010, 322.075)
6 Section 3.5 of this bill repeals this provision. Section 2.5 of this bill authorizes the
7 Administrator of the Division of State Parks of the Department, for any real
8 property owned by the State and assigned to the Division for administration, to: (1)
9 lease grazing and pasturage rights in and to the real property; or (2) sell agricultural
10 products produced on the real property. Section 2.5: (1) requires, with certain
11 exceptions, the Administrator to advertise the lease or sale for bids; and (2)
12 authorizes the Administrator to negotiate the lease or sale under certain
-
*AB543_R1*

– 2 –
13 circumstances after advertising for bids. Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill provide
14 that this authority granted to the Administrator of the Division of State Parks is an
15 exception to the authority granted to the Administrator of the Division of State
16 Lands to lease state lands.
17 Existing law creates the Account for Maintenance of State Parks within the
18 Division of State Parks and requires that money deposited in the Account must only
19 be used to repair and maintain state parks, monuments and recreational areas. (NRS
20 407.0762) Sections 2.5 and 3 of this bill require that any money collected for the
21 lease of real property owned by the State and assigned to the Division for
22 administration for grazing or pasturage or the sale of agricultural products produced
23 on such real property must be deposited in the Account and used in the area or
24 region in which the money was collected.
25 Section 2 of this bill makes conforming changes to internal references.

-
*AB543_R1*

– 4 –
1 2. The Administrator may not lease rights in or to real

36 of the grazing or pasturage rights in or to real property assigned to
37 the Division for administration or the sale of agricultural products
