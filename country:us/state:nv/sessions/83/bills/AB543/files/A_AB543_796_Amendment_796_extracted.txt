the [fees for the] lease of certain state [land] real property for [the]
grazing [of livestock;] or pasturage rights and the sale of
agricultural products produced on such real property; requiring
certain [fees] money received for the grazing of livestock and the sale
of agricultural products be deposited in the Account for Maintenance
of State Parks within the Division of State Parks of the State
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the State
2 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is authorized to lease certain land owned
3 by the State of Nevada for certain purposes, including for the purpose of grazing livestock,
4 and sets forth the manner in which the fee for the lease of land for the grazing of livestock is
5 determined. (NRS 322.010, 322.075) Section 3.5 of this bill repeals this provision. [Section
6 1 of this bill requires that fees for the lease of lands for grazing livestock on any land under
7 the jurisdiction of the Division of State Parks of the Department must be deposited in the
8 Account for Maintenance of State Parks within the Division of State Parks and used in the
9 area or region in which the fee was collected.] Section 2.5 of this bill authorizes the
10 Administrator of the Division of State Parks of the Department, for any real property
11 owned by the State and assigned to the Division for administration, to: (1) lease grazing
12 and pasturage rights in and to the real property; or (2) sell agricultural products
13 produced on the real property. Section 2.5: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, the
14 Administrator to advertise the lease or sale for bids; and (2) authorizes the
15 Administrator to negotiate the lease or sale under certain circumstances after
16 advertising for bids. Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill provide that this authority granted
Assembly Amendment No. 796 to Assembly Bill No. 543 Page 4
17 to the Administrator of the Division of State Parks is an exception to the authority
18 granted to the Administrator of the Division of State Lands to lease state lands.
19 Existing law creates the Account for Maintenance of State Parks within the Division of
20 State Parks and requires that money deposited in the Account must only be used to repair and
21 maintain state parks, monuments and recreational areas. (NRS 407.0762) [Section] Sections
22 2.5 and 3 of this bill [requires] require that any [fee] money collected for the lease of [land]
23 real property owned by the State and assigned to the Division for administration for
24 grazing [livestock on any land under the jurisdiction of the Division of State Parks] or
25 pasturage or the sale of agricultural products produced on such real property must be
26 deposited in the Account [.] and used in the area or region in which the money was
27 collected.
28 Section 2 of this bill makes conforming changes to internal references.
