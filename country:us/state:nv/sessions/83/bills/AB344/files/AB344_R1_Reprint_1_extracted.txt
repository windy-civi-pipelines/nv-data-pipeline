AN ACT relating to judiciary; replacing the term “master” with
“judicial officer” when used to refer to judicial officers
who perform certain duties; prescribing a procedure for
the transfer of child welfare proceedings to a different
court within this State; requiring the appointment of an
attorney to represent certain parties during a child welfare
proceeding in certain circumstances; revising the
compensation that an appointed attorney in certain
proceedings is entitled to receive; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the appointment of a master or special master to
2 perform certain limited duties in certain proceedings, including family law, juvenile
3 justice and traffic proceedings and certain proceedings in a justice or municipal
4 court. (NRS 3.2201, 3.405, 4.357, 5.0245, 33.019, 62B.020, 62B.030, 126.111,
5 129.080, 159A.0615, 425.381, 432B.455) Sections 3-24, 31-35, 40, 42-47, 52-63,
6 65, 66, 69-71 and 79 of this bill replace the term “master” with the term “judicial
7 officer” when used to refer to a judicial official who performs those duties.
8 Sections 1, 26, 38 and 67 of this bill define the term “judicial officer” for certain
9 purposes and sections 2, 28, 39 and 68 of this bill establish the applicability of
10 those definitions. Sections 32, 42, 43, 46-48, 54 and 70 of this bill authorize a
11 court to designate a different title to a person appointed as a judicial officer so long
12 as the title does not include the term “master.” Section 4 makes an additional
13 clarifying change regarding the appointment of judicial officers. Sections 37, 41,
14 48, 50, 51 and 72-78 of this bill make various other changes so that a judicial
-
*AB344_R1*
– 2 –
15 officer retains all of the duties, privileges and protections that such a person
16 currently has while functioning under the title “master.”
17 Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of proceedings involving
18 the legal or physical custody of a child, including child welfare proceedings, to a
19 court of another state. (NRS 125A.315, 125A.355, 125A.365) Section 27 of this
20 bill similarly establishes a procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to
21 a different court in this State. Section 27 requires: (1) the originating court and the
22 receiving court to hold a joint hearing on the potential transfer; and (2) both courts
23 to conclude that the transfer would be in the best interests of the child who is the
24 subject of the proceedings before the transfer may occur. Section 36 of this bill
25 makes a conforming change to include a reference to section 27 where appropriate.
26 Sections 29 and 49 of this bill prohibit a person from invoking certain privileges
27 during a proceeding concerning such a transfer.
28 Existing law: (1) authorizes an attorney to represent a parent or other person
29 responsible for the welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the
30 child at all stages of child welfare proceedings concerning the child; and (2)
31 requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child who is alleged to have
32 been abused or neglected at all stages of such proceedings. An appointed attorney is
33 entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
34 than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
35 criminal proceeding. (NRS 432B.420) Section 30 of this bill provides that any
36 parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child who is taken into
37 protective custody may be represented during a hearing on protective custody,
38 regardless of whether the parent is alleged to have abused or neglected the child. If
39 a petition is filed alleging that a child is in need of protection, section 30: (1)
40 requires the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent or other person
41 responsible for the welfare of a child who is allegedly responsible for the child
42 being in need of protection upon determining that the parent or other person is
43 indigent, except in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the court to appoint an
44 attorney to represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of the
45 child who is not allegedly responsible for the child being in need of protection if the
46 court determines that the parent or other person is indigent and appointment of an
47 attorney is in the best interest of the child. Section 30 also provides that an attorney
48 who is appointed to represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of
49 a child or a child in a child welfare proceeding is, except in certain circumstances,
50 entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all reasonable time and
51 expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an attorney in the same
52 jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a misdemeanor.
53 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child and
54 an indigent parent of a child during any proceeding for terminating or restoring
55 parental rights. Existing law also requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent
56 a child in such a proceeding if the child has been placed outside the home because
57 he or she was deemed to be in need of protection. Such an appointed attorney is
58 entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
59 than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
60 criminal proceeding. (NRS 128.100) Section 64 of this bill provides that such an
61 appointed attorney is entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all
62 reasonable time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an
63 attorney in the same jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a
64 felony.

44 62F.350 1. The juvenile court may not refer to a [master]

1 required to be made or performed by the juvenile court pursuant to

25 been brought, an informal hearing must be held. The court may
26 order that the hearing be held before a [master] judicial officer
27 appointed by the court or referee. The public shall be barred from

1 Sec. 61. NRS 126.121 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 126.121 1. The court may, and shall upon the motion of a

4 involved to submit to one or more tests for the typing of blood or
5 taking of specimens for genetic identification to be made by a
6 designated person, by qualified physicians or by other qualified
7 persons, under such restrictions and directions as the court or judge
8 deems proper. Whenever such a test is ordered and made, the results
9 of the test must be received in evidence and must be made available
10 to a judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by the court or
11 referee conducting a hearing pursuant to NRS 126.111. The results
12 of the test and any sample or specimen taken may be used only for
13 the purposes specified in this chapter. Unless a party files a written
14 objection to the result of a test at least 30 days before the hearing at
15 which the result is to be received in evidence, the result is
16 admissible as evidence of paternity without foundational testimony
17 or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order for such a test
18 also may direct that the testimony of the experts and of the persons
19 so examined may be taken by deposition or written interrogatories.
20 2. If any party refuses to submit to or fails to appear for a test
21 ordered pursuant to subsection 1, the court may presume that the
22 result of the test would be adverse to the interests of that party or
23 may enforce its order if the rights of others and the interests of
24 justice so require.
25 3. The court, upon reasonable request by a party, shall order
26 that independent tests for determining paternity be performed by
27 other experts or qualified laboratories.

29 qualifications of the experts and laboratories.
30 5. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Designated person” means a person who is:
32 (1) Properly trained to take samples or specimens for tests

37 Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human
38 Services, its designated representative, a district attorney or the

40 Sec. 62. NRS 126.141 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 126.141 1. On the basis of the information produced at the
42 pretrial hearing, the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a
43 court or referee conducting the hearing shall evaluate the probability
44 of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child
45 relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of the
-
*AB344_R1*
– 49 –
1 relationship would be in the best interest of the child. On the basis
2 of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement
3 must be made to the parties, which may include any of the
4 following:
5 (a) That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice.
6 (b) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the
7 alleged father, the mother and the child, in which the father and
8 child relationship is not determined but in which a defined economic
9 obligation, fully secured by payment or otherwise, is undertaken by
10 the alleged father in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of
11 the mother, subject to approval by the judge, [master] judicial
12 officer or referee conducting the hearing. In reviewing the
13 obligation undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise
14 agreement, the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting
15 the hearing shall consider the best interest of the child, discounted
16 by the improbability, as it appears to him or her, of establishing the
17 alleged father’s paternity or nonpaternity of the child in a trial of the
18 action. In the best interest of the child, the court may order that
19 the alleged father’s identity be kept confidential. In that case, the
20 court may designate a person or agency to receive from the alleged
21 father and disburse on behalf of the child all amounts paid by the
22 alleged father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on the alleged
23 father.
24 (c) That the alleged father voluntarily acknowledge his paternity
25 of the child.
26 2. If the parties accept a recommendation made in accordance
27 with subsection 1, judgment may be entered accordingly.
28 3. If a party refuses to accept a recommendation made under
29 subsection 1 and blood tests or tests for genetic identification have
30 not been taken, the court shall require the parties to submit to blood
31 tests or tests for genetic identification, if practicable. Thereafter the
32 judge, [master] judicial officer or referee shall make an appropriate
33 final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final
34 recommendation, the action must be set for trial.
35 4. The guardian ad litem may accept or refuse to accept a
36 recommendation under this section.
37 5. The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for
38 trial if the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting the
39 hearing finds unlikely that all parties would accept a
40 recommendation he or she might make under subsection 1 or 3.
41 Sec. 63. NRS 126.143 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 126.143 After an action is set for trial pursuant to NRS
43 126.141, the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or
44 referee shall, upon the motion of a party, issue an order providing
45 for the temporary support of the child pending the resolution of the
-
*AB344_R1*
– 50 –
1 trial if the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee determines that
2 there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom
3 the order is issued is the father of the child.
4 Sec. 64. NRS 128.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 128.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in
6 any proceeding for terminating parental rights, or any rehearing or
7 appeal thereon, or any proceeding for restoring parental rights, the
8 court may appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her
9 counsel. The child may be represented by an attorney at all stages of
10 any proceedings for terminating parental rights. If the child is
11 represented by an attorney, the attorney has the same authority and
12 rights as an attorney representing a party to the proceedings.
13 2. In any proceeding for the termination of parental rights to a
14 child who has been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to
15 chapter 432B of NRS, or any rehearing or appeal thereon, or any
16 proceeding for restoring parental rights to such a child, the court
17 shall appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her counsel.
18 The child shall be deemed to be a party to any proceeding described
19 in this section and must be represented by an attorney at all stages of
20 such proceedings. The attorney representing the child has the same
21 authority and rights as an attorney representing any other party to
22 the proceedings.
23 3. If the parent or parents of the child desire to be represented
24 by counsel, but are indigent, the court may appoint an attorney for
25 them.

28 as provided in NRS 7.125 and 7.135] for all time reasonably spent
29 on the proceedings and payment for all expenses reasonably
30 incurred from the proceedings, including, without limitation, time
31 spent and expenses incurred for preparation, hearings and
32 meetings. Such compensation must be paid at a rate not less than
33 the lowest rate paid to attorneys appointed to represent persons
34 charged with [crimes.] a felony in the same jurisdiction.

36 indigent if:

(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to judiciary; replacing the term “master” with
“judicial officer” when used to refer to judicial officers
who perform certain duties; prescribing a procedure for
the transfer of child welfare proceedings to a different
court within this State; requiring the appointment of an
attorney to represent certain parties during a child welfare
proceeding in certain circumstances; revising the
compensation that an appointed attorney in certain
proceedings is entitled to receive; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the appointment of a master or special master to
2 perform certain limited duties in certain proceedings, including family law, juvenile
3 justice and traffic proceedings and certain proceedings in a justice or municipal
4 court. (NRS 3.2201, 3.405, 4.357, 5.0245, 33.019, 62B.020, 62B.030, 126.111,
5 129.080, 159A.0615, 425.381, 432B.455) Sections 3-24, 31-35, 40, 42-47, 52-63,
6 65, 66, 69-71 and 79 of this bill replace the term “master” with the term “judicial
7 officer” when used to refer to a judicial official who performs those duties.
8 Sections 1, 26, 38 and 67 of this bill define the term “judicial officer” for certain
9 purposes and sections 2, 28, 39 and 68 of this bill establish the applicability of
10 those definitions. Sections 32, 42, 43, 46-48, 54 and 70 of this bill authorize a
11 court to designate a different title to a person appointed as a judicial officer so long
12 as the title does not include the term “master.” Section 4 makes an additional
13 clarifying change regarding the appointment of judicial officers. Sections 37, 41,
14 48, 50, 51 and 72-78 of this bill make various other changes so that a judicial
-
*AB344_R1*

– 2 –
15 officer retains all of the duties, privileges and protections that such a person
16 currently has while functioning under the title “master.”
17 Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of proceedings involving
18 the legal or physical custody of a child, including child welfare proceedings, to a
19 court of another state. (NRS 125A.315, 125A.355, 125A.365) Section 27 of this
20 bill similarly establishes a procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to
21 a different court in this State. Section 27 requires: (1) the originating court and the
22 receiving court to hold a joint hearing on the potential transfer; and (2) both courts
23 to conclude that the transfer would be in the best interests of the child who is the
24 subject of the proceedings before the transfer may occur. Section 36 of this bill
25 makes a conforming change to include a reference to section 27 where appropriate.
26 Sections 29 and 49 of this bill prohibit a person from invoking certain privileges
27 during a proceeding concerning such a transfer.
28 Existing law: (1) authorizes an attorney to represent a parent or other person
29 responsible for the welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the
30 child at all stages of child welfare proceedings concerning the child; and (2)
31 requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child who is alleged to have
32 been abused or neglected at all stages of such proceedings. An appointed attorney is
33 entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
34 than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
35 criminal proceeding. (NRS 432B.420) Section 30 of this bill provides that any
36 parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child who is taken into
37 protective custody may be represented during a hearing on protective custody,
38 regardless of whether the parent is alleged to have abused or neglected the child. If
39 a petition is filed alleging that a child is in need of protection, section 30: (1)
40 requires the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent or other person
41 responsible for the welfare of a child who is allegedly responsible for the child
42 being in need of protection upon determining that the parent or other person is
43 indigent, except in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the court to appoint an
44 attorney to represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of the
45 child who is not allegedly responsible for the child being in need of protection if the
46 court determines that the parent or other person is indigent and appointment of an
47 attorney is in the best interest of the child. Section 30 also provides that an attorney
48 who is appointed to represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of
49 a child or a child in a child welfare proceeding is, except in certain circumstances,
50 entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all reasonable time and
51 expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an attorney in the same
52 jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a misdemeanor.
53 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child and
54 an indigent parent of a child during any proceeding for terminating or restoring
55 parental rights. Existing law also requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent
56 a child in such a proceeding if the child has been placed outside the home because
57 he or she was deemed to be in need of protection. Such an appointed attorney is
58 entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
59 than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
60 criminal proceeding. (NRS 128.100) Section 64 of this bill provides that such an
61 appointed attorney is entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all
62 reasonable time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an
63 attorney in the same jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a
64 felony.

25 been brought, an informal hearing must be held. The court may
26 order that the hearing be held before a [master] judicial officer
27 appointed by the court or referee. The public shall be barred from

1 Sec. 61. NRS 126.121 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 126.121 1. The court may, and shall upon the motion of a
3 party, order the mother, child, alleged father or any other person so
4 involved to submit to one or more tests for the typing of blood or
5 taking of specimens for genetic identification to be made by a
6 designated person, by qualified physicians or by other qualified
7 persons, under such restrictions and directions as the court or judge
8 deems proper. Whenever such a test is ordered and made, the results
9 of the test must be received in evidence and must be made available
10 to a judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by the court or
11 referee conducting a hearing pursuant to NRS 126.111. The results
12 of the test and any sample or specimen taken may be used only for
13 the purposes specified in this chapter. Unless a party files a written
14 objection to the result of a test at least 30 days before the hearing at
15 which the result is to be received in evidence, the result is
16 admissible as evidence of paternity without foundational testimony
17 or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order for such a test
18 also may direct that the testimony of the experts and of the persons
19 so examined may be taken by deposition or written interrogatories.
20 2. If any party refuses to submit to or fails to appear for a test
21 ordered pursuant to subsection 1, the court may presume that the
22 result of the test would be adverse to the interests of that party or
23 may enforce its order if the rights of others and the interests of
24 justice so require.
25 3. The court, upon reasonable request by a party, shall order
26 that independent tests for determining paternity be performed by
27 other experts or qualified laboratories.

29 qualifications of the experts and laboratories.
30 5. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Designated person” means a person who is:
32 (1) Properly trained to take samples or specimens for tests

37 Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human
38 Services, its designated representative, a district attorney or the

40 Sec. 62. NRS 126.141 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 126.141 1. On the basis of the information produced at the
42 pretrial hearing, the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a
43 court or referee conducting the hearing shall evaluate the probability
44 of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child
45 relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of the
-
*AB344_R1*

– 49 –
1 relationship would be in the best interest of the child. On the basis
2 of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement
3 must be made to the parties, which may include any of the
4 following:
5 (a) That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice.
6 (b) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the
7 alleged father, the mother and the child, in which the father and
8 child relationship is not determined but in which a defined economic
9 obligation, fully secured by payment or otherwise, is undertaken by
10 the alleged father in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of
11 the mother, subject to approval by the judge, [master] judicial
12 officer or referee conducting the hearing. In reviewing the
13 obligation undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise
14 agreement, the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting
15 the hearing shall consider the best interest of the child, discounted
16 by the improbability, as it appears to him or her, of establishing the
17 alleged father’s paternity or nonpaternity of the child in a trial of the
18 action. In the best interest of the child, the court may order that
19 the alleged father’s identity be kept confidential. In that case, the
20 court may designate a person or agency to receive from the alleged
21 father and disburse on behalf of the child all amounts paid by the
22 alleged father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on the alleged
23 father.
24 (c) That the alleged father voluntarily acknowledge his paternity
25 of the child.
26 2. If the parties accept a recommendation made in accordance
27 with subsection 1, judgment may be entered accordingly.
28 3. If a party refuses to accept a recommendation made under
29 subsection 1 and blood tests or tests for genetic identification have
30 not been taken, the court shall require the parties to submit to blood
31 tests or tests for genetic identification, if practicable. Thereafter the
32 judge, [master] judicial officer or referee shall make an appropriate
33 final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final
34 recommendation, the action must be set for trial.
35 4. The guardian ad litem may accept or refuse to accept a
36 recommendation under this section.
37 5. The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for
38 trial if the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting the
39 hearing finds unlikely that all parties would accept a
40 recommendation he or she might make under subsection 1 or 3.
41 Sec. 63. NRS 126.143 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 126.143 After an action is set for trial pursuant to NRS
43 126.141, the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or
44 referee shall, upon the motion of a party, issue an order providing
45 for the temporary support of the child pending the resolution of the
-
*AB344_R1*

– 50 –
1 trial if the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee determines that
2 there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom
3 the order is issued is the father of the child.
4 Sec. 64. NRS 128.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 128.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in
6 any proceeding for terminating parental rights, or any rehearing or
7 appeal thereon, or any proceeding for restoring parental rights, the
8 court may appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her
9 counsel. The child may be represented by an attorney at all stages of
10 any proceedings for terminating parental rights. If the child is
11 represented by an attorney, the attorney has the same authority and
12 rights as an attorney representing a party to the proceedings.
13 2. In any proceeding for the termination of parental rights to a
14 child who has been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to
15 chapter 432B of NRS, or any rehearing or appeal thereon, or any
16 proceeding for restoring parental rights to such a child, the court
17 shall appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her counsel.
18 The child shall be deemed to be a party to any proceeding described
19 in this section and must be represented by an attorney at all stages of
20 such proceedings. The attorney representing the child has the same
21 authority and rights as an attorney representing any other party to
22 the proceedings.
23 3. If the parent or parents of the child desire to be represented
24 by counsel, but are indigent, the court may appoint an attorney for
25 them.
26 4. Each attorney appointed under the provisions of this section

28 as provided in NRS 7.125 and 7.135] for all time reasonably spent
29 on the proceedings and payment for all expenses reasonably
30 incurred from the proceedings, including, without limitation, time
31 spent and expenses incurred for preparation, hearings and
32 meetings. Such compensation must be paid at a rate not less than
33 the lowest rate paid to attorneys appointed to represent persons

8 established to provide persons of low income with an opportunity
9 to purchase a more nutritious diet pursuant to the Food Stamp Act
