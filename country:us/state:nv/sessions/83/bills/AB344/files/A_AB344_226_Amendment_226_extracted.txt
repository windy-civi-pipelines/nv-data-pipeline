AN ACT relating to judiciary; replacing the term “master” with “judicial officer”
when used to refer to judicial officers who perform certain duties;
prescribing a procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to
a different court within this State; requiring the appointment of an
attorney to represent certain parties during a child welfare proceeding
in certain circumstances; revising the compensation that an appointed
attorney in certain proceedings is entitled to receive; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the appointment of a master or special master to perform certain
2 limited duties in certain proceedings, including family law, juvenile justice and traffic
3 proceedings and certain proceedings in a justice or municipal court. (NRS 3.2201, 3.405,
4 4.357, 5.0245, 33.019, 62B.020, 62B.030, 126.111, 129.080, 159A.0615, 425.381, 432B.455)
5 Sections 3-24, 31-35, 40, 42-47, 52-63, 65, 66, 69-71 and 79 of this bill replace the term
6 “master” with the term “judicial officer” when used to refer to a judicial official who performs
7 those duties. Sections 1, 26, 38 and 67 of this bill define the term “judicial officer” for certain
8 purposes and sections 2, 28, 39 and 68 of this bill establish the applicability of those
9 definitions. Sections 32, 42, 43, 46-48, 54 and 70 of this bill authorize a court to designate a
10 different title to a person appointed as a judicial officer so long as the title does not include the
11 term “master.” Section 4 makes an additional clarifying change regarding the appointment of
12 judicial officers. Sections 37, 41, 48, 50, 51 and 72-78 of this bill make various other changes
13 so that a judicial officer retains all of the duties, privileges and protections that such a person
14 currently has while functioning under the title “master.”
15 Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of proceedings involving the legal or
16 physical custody of a child, including child welfare proceedings, to a court of another state.
17 (NRS 125A.315, 125A.355, 125A.365) Section 27 of this bill similarly establishes a
18 procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to a different court in this State.
19 Section 27 requires: (1) the originating court and the receiving court to hold a joint hearing on
20 the potential transfer; and (2) both courts to conclude that the transfer would be in the best
21 interests of the child who is the subject of the proceedings before the transfer may occur.
22 Section 36 of this bill makes a conforming change to include a reference to section 27 where
Assembly Amendment No. 226 to Assembly Bill No. 344 Page 4
23 appropriate. Sections 29 and 49 of this bill prohibit a person from invoking certain privileges
24 during a proceeding concerning such a transfer.
25 Existing law: (1) authorizes an attorney to represent a parent or other person responsible
26 for the welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the child at all stages of
27 child welfare proceedings concerning the child; and (2) requires a court to appoint an attorney
28 to represent a child who is alleged to have been abused or neglected at all stages of such
29 proceedings. An appointed attorney is entitled to the same compensation and payment for
30 expenses as an attorney, other than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a
31 defendant at any stage of a criminal proceeding. (NRS 432B.420) Section 30 of this bill
32 provides that any parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child who is taken
33 into protective custody may be represented during [the child welfare proceedings,] a hearing
34 on protective custody, regardless of whether the parent is alleged to have abused or neglected
35 the child. If a petition is filed alleging that a child is in need of protection, section 30 : (1)
36 requires the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent or other person responsible
37 for the welfare of a child who is allegedly responsible for the child being in need of protection
38 upon determining that the parent or other person is indigent, except in certain circumstances
39 [.] ; and (2) authorizes the court to appoint an attorney to represent a parent or other
40 person responsible for the welfare of the child who is not allegedly responsible for the
41 child being in need of protection if the court determines that the parent or other person
42 is indigent and appointment of an attorney is in the best interest of the child. Section 30
43 also provides that an attorney who is appointed to represent a parent or other person
44 responsible for the welfare of a child or a child in a child welfare proceeding is, except in
45 certain circumstances, entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all reasonable
46 time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an attorney in the same
47 jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a misdemeanor.
48 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child and an indigent
49 parent of a child during any proceeding for terminating or restoring parental rights. Existing
50 law also requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child in such a proceeding if the
51 child has been placed outside the home because he or she was deemed to be in need of
52 protection. Such an appointed attorney is entitled to the same compensation and payment for
53 expenses as an attorney, other than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a
54 defendant at any stage of a criminal proceeding. (NRS 128.100) Section 64 of this bill
55 provides that such an appointed attorney is entitled to compensation and payment for expenses
56 for all reasonable time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an
57 attorney in the same jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a felony.

13 receiving court may elect to hold a joint hearing pursuant to subsection 1 and, if
14 both courts determine pursuant to subsection [4] 5 that the transfer would be in
15 the best interests of the child, transfer the proceedings to the receiving court
16 before the adjudicatory hearing.

18 hearing is conducted pursuant to subsection 1 and the agency which provides
19 child welfare services in the jurisdiction of the receiving court is different from

28 pursuant to this chapter by an informal hearing.
29 2. As soon as practicable after an action to declare the existence or

31 hearing must be held. The court may order that the hearing be held before a
32 [master] judicial officer appointed by the court or referee. The public shall be

2 in evidence and must be made available to a judge, [master] judicial officer
3 appointed by the court or referee conducting a hearing pursuant to NRS 126.111.

5 purposes specified in this chapter. Unless a party files a written objection to the
6 result of a test at least 30 days before the hearing at which the result is to be
7 received in evidence, the result is admissible as evidence of paternity without
8 foundational testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order for

31 126.141 1. On the basis of the information produced at the pretrial hearing,
32 the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or referee conducting the
33 hearing shall evaluate the probability of determining the existence or nonexistence
34 of the father and child relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of
35 the relationship would be in the best interest of the child. On the basis of the
36 evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement must be made to the
37 parties, which may include any of the following:
38 (a) That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice.
39 (b) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the alleged father,
40 the mother and the child, in which the father and child relationship is not

42 or otherwise, is undertaken by the alleged father in favor of the child and, if
43 appropriate, in favor of the mother, subject to approval by the judge, [master]
44 judicial officer or referee conducting the hearing. In reviewing the obligation
45 undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise agreement, the judge, [master]
46 judicial officer or referee conducting the hearing shall consider the best interest of
47 the child, discounted by the improbability, as it appears to him or her, of
48 establishing the alleged father’s paternity or nonpaternity of the child in a trial of
49 the action. In the best interest of the child, the court may order that the alleged
50 father’s identity be kept confidential. In that case, the court may designate a person
51 or agency to receive from the alleged father and disburse on behalf of the child all
52 amounts paid by the alleged father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on the
53 alleged father.
Assembly Amendment No. 226 to Assembly Bill No. 344 Page 38
1 (c) That the alleged father voluntarily acknowledge his paternity of the child.
2 2. If the parties accept a recommendation made in accordance with subsection
3 1, judgment may be entered accordingly.
4 3. If a party refuses to accept a recommendation made under subsection 1 and
5 blood tests or tests for genetic identification have not been taken, the court shall
6 require the parties to submit to blood tests or tests for genetic identification, if
7 practicable. Thereafter the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee shall make an
8 appropriate final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final
9 recommendation, the action must be set for trial.
10 4. The guardian ad litem may accept or refuse to accept a recommendation
11 under this section.
12 5. The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for trial if the
13 judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting the hearing finds unlikely that
14 all parties would accept a recommendation he or she might make under subsection
15 1 or 3.
16 Sec. 63. NRS 126.143 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 126.143 After an action is set for trial pursuant to NRS 126.141, the judge,
18 [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or referee shall, upon the motion of a
19 party, issue an order providing for the temporary support of the child pending the

21 that there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom the order is
22 issued is the father of the child.
23 Sec. 64. NRS 128.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 128.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in any proceeding
25 for terminating parental rights, or any rehearing or appeal thereon, or any
26 proceeding for restoring parental rights, the court may appoint an attorney to
27 represent the child as his or her counsel. The child may be represented by an
28 attorney at all stages of any proceedings for terminating parental rights. If the child
29 is represented by an attorney, the attorney has the same authority and rights as an
30 attorney representing a party to the proceedings.
31 2. In any proceeding for the termination of parental rights to a child who has
32 been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS, or any
33 rehearing or appeal thereon, or any proceeding for restoring parental rights to such
34 a child, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her
35 counsel. The child shall be deemed to be a party to any proceeding described in this
36 section and must be represented by an attorney at all stages of such proceedings.
37 The attorney representing the child has the same authority and rights as an attorney
38 representing any other party to the proceedings.
39 3. If the parent or parents of the child desire to be represented by counsel, but
40 are indigent, the court may appoint an attorney for them.
41 4. Each attorney appointed under the provisions of this section is entitled to

Referred to Committee on Judiciary

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 30, 64)

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to judiciary; replacing the term “master” with “judicial officer”
when used to refer to judicial officers who perform certain duties;
prescribing a procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to
a different court within this State; requiring the appointment of an
attorney to represent certain parties during a child welfare proceeding
in certain circumstances; revising the compensation that an appointed
attorney in certain proceedings is entitled to receive; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the appointment of a master or special master to perform certain
2 limited duties in certain proceedings, including family law, juvenile justice and traffic
3 proceedings and certain proceedings in a justice or municipal court. (NRS 3.2201, 3.405,
4 4.357, 5.0245, 33.019, 62B.020, 62B.030, 126.111, 129.080, 159A.0615, 425.381, 432B.455)
5 Sections 3-24, 31-35, 40, 42-47, 52-63, 65, 66, 69-71 and 79 of this bill replace the term
6 “master” with the term “judicial officer” when used to refer to a judicial official who performs
7 those duties. Sections 1, 26, 38 and 67 of this bill define the term “judicial officer” for certain
8 purposes and sections 2, 28, 39 and 68 of this bill establish the applicability of those
9 definitions. Sections 32, 42, 43, 46-48, 54 and 70 of this bill authorize a court to designate a
10 different title to a person appointed as a judicial officer so long as the title does not include the
11 term “master.” Section 4 makes an additional clarifying change regarding the appointment of
12 judicial officers. Sections 37, 41, 48, 50, 51 and 72-78 of this bill make various other changes
13 so that a judicial officer retains all of the duties, privileges and protections that such a person
14 currently has while functioning under the title “master.”
15 Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of proceedings involving the legal or
16 physical custody of a child, including child welfare proceedings, to a court of another state.
17 (NRS 125A.315, 125A.355, 125A.365) Section 27 of this bill similarly establishes a
18 procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to a different court in this State.
19 Section 27 requires: (1) the originating court and the receiving court to hold a joint hearing on
20 the potential transfer; and (2) both courts to conclude that the transfer would be in the best
21 interests of the child who is the subject of the proceedings before the transfer may occur.
22 Section 36 of this bill makes a conforming change to include a reference to section 27 where

Assembly Amendment No. 226 to Assembly Bill No. 344 Page 4
23 appropriate. Sections 29 and 49 of this bill prohibit a person from invoking certain privileges
24 during a proceeding concerning such a transfer.
25 Existing law: (1) authorizes an attorney to represent a parent or other person responsible
26 for the welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the child at all stages of
27 child welfare proceedings concerning the child; and (2) requires a court to appoint an attorney
28 to represent a child who is alleged to have been abused or neglected at all stages of such
29 proceedings. An appointed attorney is entitled to the same compensation and payment for
30 expenses as an attorney, other than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a
31 defendant at any stage of a criminal proceeding. (NRS 432B.420) Section 30 of this bill
32 provides that any parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child who is taken
33 into protective custody may be represented during [the child welfare proceedings,] a hearing
34 on protective custody, regardless of whether the parent is alleged to have abused or neglected
35 the child. If a petition is filed alleging that a child is in need of protection, section 30 : (1)
36 requires the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent or other person responsible
37 for the welfare of a child who is allegedly responsible for the child being in need of protection
38 upon determining that the parent or other person is indigent, except in certain circumstances
39 [.] ; and (2) authorizes the court to appoint an attorney to represent a parent or other
40 person responsible for the welfare of the child who is not allegedly responsible for the
41 child being in need of protection if the court determines that the parent or other person
42 is indigent and appointment of an attorney is in the best interest of the child. Section 30
43 also provides that an attorney who is appointed to represent a parent or other person
44 responsible for the welfare of a child or a child in a child welfare proceeding is, except in
45 certain circumstances, entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all reasonable
46 time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an attorney in the same
47 jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a misdemeanor.
48 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child and an indigent
49 parent of a child during any proceeding for terminating or restoring parental rights. Existing
50 law also requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child in such a proceeding if the
51 child has been placed outside the home because he or she was deemed to be in need of
52 protection. Such an appointed attorney is entitled to the same compensation and payment for
53 expenses as an attorney, other than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a
54 defendant at any stage of a criminal proceeding. (NRS 128.100) Section 64 of this bill
55 provides that such an appointed attorney is entitled to compensation and payment for expenses
56 for all reasonable time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an
57 attorney in the same jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a felony.

28 pursuant to this chapter by an informal hearing.
29 2. As soon as practicable after an action to declare the existence or
30 nonexistence of the father and child relationship has been brought, an informal
31 hearing must be held. The court may order that the hearing be held before a
32 [master] judicial officer appointed by the court or referee. The public shall be

2 in evidence and must be made available to a judge, [master] judicial officer
3 appointed by the court or referee conducting a hearing pursuant to NRS 126.111.
4 The results of the test and any sample or specimen taken may be used only for the
5 purposes specified in this chapter. Unless a party files a written objection to the
6 result of a test at least 30 days before the hearing at which the result is to be
7 received in evidence, the result is admissible as evidence of paternity without
8 foundational testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order for

31 126.141 1. On the basis of the information produced at the pretrial hearing,
32 the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or referee conducting the
33 hearing shall evaluate the probability of determining the existence or nonexistence
34 of the father and child relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of
35 the relationship would be in the best interest of the child. On the basis of the
36 evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement must be made to the
37 parties, which may include any of the following:
38 (a) That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice.
39 (b) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the alleged father,
40 the mother and the child, in which the father and child relationship is not
41 determined but in which a defined economic obligation, fully secured by payment
42 or otherwise, is undertaken by the alleged father in favor of the child and, if
43 appropriate, in favor of the mother, subject to approval by the judge, [master]
44 judicial officer or referee conducting the hearing. In reviewing the obligation
45 undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise agreement, the judge, [master]
46 judicial officer or referee conducting the hearing shall consider the best interest of
47 the child, discounted by the improbability, as it appears to him or her, of
48 establishing the alleged father’s paternity or nonpaternity of the child in a trial of
49 the action. In the best interest of the child, the court may order that the alleged
50 father’s identity be kept confidential. In that case, the court may designate a person
51 or agency to receive from the alleged father and disburse on behalf of the child all
52 amounts paid by the alleged father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on the
53 alleged father.

Assembly Amendment No. 226 to Assembly Bill No. 344 Page 38

3 1, judgment may be entered accordingly.
4 3. If a party refuses to accept a recommendation made under subsection 1 and
5 blood tests or tests for genetic identification have not been taken, the court shall
6 require the parties to submit to blood tests or tests for genetic identification, if
7 practicable. Thereafter the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee shall make an
8 appropriate final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final
9 recommendation, the action must be set for trial.
10 4. The guardian ad litem may accept or refuse to accept a recommendation
11 under this section.
12 5. The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for trial if the
13 judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting the hearing finds unlikely that

15 1 or 3.

18 [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or referee shall, upon the motion of a
19 party, issue an order providing for the temporary support of the child pending the

21 that there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom the order is
22 issued is the father of the child.
23 Sec. 64. NRS 128.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 128.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in any proceeding
25 for terminating parental rights, or any rehearing or appeal thereon, or any
26 proceeding for restoring parental rights, the court may appoint an attorney to
27 represent the child as his or her counsel. The child may be represented by an
28 attorney at all stages of any proceedings for terminating parental rights. If the child
29 is represented by an attorney, the attorney has the same authority and rights as an
30 attorney representing a party to the proceedings.
31 2. In any proceeding for the termination of parental rights to a child who has
32 been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS, or any
33 rehearing or appeal thereon, or any proceeding for restoring parental rights to such
34 a child, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her
35 counsel. The child shall be deemed to be a party to any proceeding described in this
36 section and must be represented by an attorney at all stages of such proceedings.
37 The attorney representing the child has the same authority and rights as an attorney
38 representing any other party to the proceedings.
39 3. If the parent or parents of the child desire to be represented by counsel, but
40 are indigent, the court may appoint an attorney for them.
