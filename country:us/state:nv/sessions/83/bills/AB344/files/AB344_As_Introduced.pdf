AN ACT relating to judiciary; replacing the term “master” with
“judicial officer” when used to refer to judicial officers
who perform certain duties; prescribing a procedure for
the transfer of child welfare proceedings to a different
court within this State; requiring the appointment of an
attorney to represent certain parties during a child welfare
proceeding in certain circumstances; revising the
compensation that an appointed attorney in certain
proceedings is entitled to receive; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the appointment of a master or special master to
2 perform certain limited duties in certain proceedings, including family law, juvenile
3 justice and traffic proceedings and certain proceedings in a justice or municipal
4 court. (NRS 3.2201, 3.405, 4.357, 5.0245, 33.019, 62B.020, 62B.030, 126.111,
5 129.080, 159A.0615, 425.381, 432B.455) Sections 3-24, 31-35, 40, 42-47, 52-63,
6 65, 66, 69-71 and 79 of this bill replace the term “master” with the term “judicial
7 officer” when used to refer to a judicial official who performs those duties.
8 Sections 1, 26, 38 and 67 of this bill define the term “judicial officer” for certain
9 purposes and sections 2, 28, 39 and 68 of this bill establish the applicability of
10 those definitions. Sections 32, 42, 43, 46-48, 54 and 70 of this bill authorize a
11 court to designate a different title to a person appointed as a judicial officer so long
12 as the title does not include the term “master.” Section 4 makes an additional
13 clarifying change regarding the appointment of judicial officers. Sections 37, 41,
14 48, 50, 51 and 72-78 of this bill make various other changes so that a judicial
-

– 2 –
15 officer retains all of the duties, privileges and protections that such a person
16 currently has while functioning under the title “master.”
17 Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of proceedings involving
18 the legal or physical custody of a child, including child welfare proceedings, to a
19 court of another state. (NRS 125A.315, 125A.355, 125A.365) Section 27 of this
20 bill similarly establishes a procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to
21 a different court in this State. Section 27 requires: (1) the originating court and the
22 receiving court to hold a joint hearing on the potential transfer; and (2) both courts
23 to conclude that the transfer would be in the best interests of the child who is the
24 subject of the proceedings before the transfer may occur. Section 36 of this bill
25 makes a conforming change to include a reference to section 27 where appropriate.
26 Sections 29 and 49 of this bill prohibit a person from invoking certain privileges
27 during a proceeding concerning such a transfer.
28 Existing law: (1) authorizes an attorney to represent a parent or other person
29 responsible for the welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the
30 child at all stages of child welfare proceedings concerning the child; and (2)
31 requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child who is alleged to have
32 been abused or neglected at all stages of such proceedings. An appointed attorney is
33 entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
34 than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
35 criminal proceeding. (NRS 432B.420) Section 30 of this bill provides that any
36 parent or person responsible for the welfare of a child who is taken into protective
37 custody may be represented during the child welfare proceedings, regardless of
38 whether the parent is alleged to have abused or neglected the child. If a petition is
39 filed alleging that a child is in need of protection, section 30 requires the court to
40 appoint an attorney to represent the parent or person responsible for the welfare of a
41 child who is allegedly responsible for the child being need of protection upon
42 determining that the parent or other person is indigent, except in certain
43 circumstances. Section 30 also provides that an attorney who is appointed to
44 represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child or a child in
45 a child welfare proceeding is, except in certain circumstances, entitled to
46 compensation and payment for expenses for all reasonable time and expenses spent
47 on the case at a rate not less than the rate an attorney in the same jurisdiction
48 receives for representing a person charged with a misdemeanor.
49 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child and
50 an indigent parent of a child during any proceeding for terminating or restoring
51 parental rights. Existing law also requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent
52 a child in such a proceeding if the child has been placed outside the home because
53 he or she was deemed to be in need of protection. Such an appointed attorney is
54 entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
55 than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
56 criminal proceeding. (NRS 128.100) Section 64 of this bill provides that such an
57 appointed attorney is entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all
58 reasonable time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an
59 attorney in the same jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a
60 felony.

-
*AB344*

– 47 –
1 2. As soon as practicable after an action to declare the
2 existence or nonexistence of the father and child relationship has
3 been brought, an informal hearing must be held. The court may
4 order that the hearing be held before a [master] judicial officer
5 appointed by the court or referee. The public shall be barred from
6 the hearing. A record of the proceeding or any portion thereof must

15 grant the witness immunity from prosecution for all criminal
16 offenses shown in whole or in part by testimony or evidence the
17 witness is required to produce, except for perjury committed in his

28 taking of specimens for genetic identification to be made by a
29 designated person, by qualified physicians or by other qualified
30 persons, under such restrictions and directions as the court or judge
31 deems proper. Whenever such a test is ordered and made, the results
32 of the test must be received in evidence and must be made available
33 to a judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by the court or
34 referee conducting a hearing pursuant to NRS 126.111. The results
35 of the test and any sample or specimen taken may be used only for
36 the purposes specified in this chapter. Unless a party files a written
37 objection to the result of a test at least 30 days before the hearing at
38 which the result is to be received in evidence, the result is
39 admissible as evidence of paternity without foundational testimony
40 or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order for such a test
41 also may direct that the testimony of the experts and of the persons
42 so examined may be taken by deposition or written interrogatories.
43 2. If any party refuses to submit to or fails to appear for a test
44 ordered pursuant to subsection 1, the court may presume that the
45 result of the test would be adverse to the interests of that party or
-
*AB344*

– 48 –
1 may enforce its order if the rights of others and the interests of
2 justice so require.
3 3. The court, upon reasonable request by a party, shall order
4 that independent tests for determining paternity be performed by

7 qualifications of the experts and laboratories.
8 5. As used in this section:

15 Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human
16 Services, its designated representative, a district attorney or the

18 Sec. 62. NRS 126.141 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 126.141 1. On the basis of the information produced at the
20 pretrial hearing, the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a
21 court or referee conducting the hearing shall evaluate the probability
22 of determining the existence or nonexistence of the father and child
23 relationship in a trial and whether a judicial declaration of the
24 relationship would be in the best interest of the child. On the basis
25 of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement
26 must be made to the parties, which may include any of the
27 following:
28 (a) That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice.
29 (b) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the
30 alleged father, the mother and the child, in which the father and
31 child relationship is not determined but in which a defined economic
32 obligation, fully secured by payment or otherwise, is undertaken by
33 the alleged father in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of
34 the mother, subject to approval by the judge, [master] judicial
35 officer or referee conducting the hearing. In reviewing the
36 obligation undertaken by the alleged father in a compromise
37 agreement, the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting
38 the hearing shall consider the best interest of the child, discounted
39 by the improbability, as it appears to him or her, of establishing the
40 alleged father’s paternity or nonpaternity of the child in a trial of the
41 action. In the best interest of the child, the court may order that
42 the alleged father’s identity be kept confidential. In that case, the
43 court may designate a person or agency to receive from the alleged
44 father and disburse on behalf of the child all amounts paid by the
-
*AB344*

– 49 –
1 alleged father in fulfillment of obligations imposed on the alleged
2 father.
3 (c) That the alleged father voluntarily acknowledge his paternity
4 of the child.
5 2. If the parties accept a recommendation made in accordance
6 with subsection 1, judgment may be entered accordingly.
7 3. If a party refuses to accept a recommendation made under
8 subsection 1 and blood tests or tests for genetic identification have
9 not been taken, the court shall require the parties to submit to blood
10 tests or tests for genetic identification, if practicable. Thereafter the
11 judge, [master] judicial officer or referee shall make an appropriate
12 final recommendation. If a party refuses to accept the final
13 recommendation, the action must be set for trial.
14 4. The guardian ad litem may accept or refuse to accept a
15 recommendation under this section.
16 5. The pretrial hearing may be terminated and the action set for
17 trial if the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee conducting the
18 hearing finds unlikely that all parties would accept a
19 recommendation he or she might make under subsection 1 or 3.
20 Sec. 63. NRS 126.143 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 126.143 After an action is set for trial pursuant to NRS
22 126.141, the judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by a court or
23 referee shall, upon the motion of a party, issue an order providing
24 for the temporary support of the child pending the resolution of the
25 trial if the judge, [master] judicial officer or referee determines that
26 there is clear and convincing evidence that the party against whom
27 the order is issued is the father of the child.
28 Sec. 64. NRS 128.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 128.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in
30 any proceeding for terminating parental rights, or any rehearing or
31 appeal thereon, or any proceeding for restoring parental rights, the
32 court may appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her
33 counsel. The child may be represented by an attorney at all stages of
34 any proceedings for terminating parental rights. If the child is
35 represented by an attorney, the attorney has the same authority and
36 rights as an attorney representing a party to the proceedings.
37 2. In any proceeding for the termination of parental rights to a
38 child who has been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to
39 chapter 432B of NRS, or any rehearing or appeal thereon, or any
40 proceeding for restoring parental rights to such a child, the court
41 shall appoint an attorney to represent the child as his or her counsel.
42 The child shall be deemed to be a party to any proceeding described
43 in this section and must be represented by an attorney at all stages of
44 such proceedings. The attorney representing the child has the same
-
*AB344*

– 50 –
1 authority and rights as an attorney representing any other party to
2 the proceedings.
3 3. If the parent or parents of the child desire to be represented
4 by counsel, but are indigent, the court may appoint an attorney for
5 them.

10 incurred from the proceedings, including, without limitation, time
