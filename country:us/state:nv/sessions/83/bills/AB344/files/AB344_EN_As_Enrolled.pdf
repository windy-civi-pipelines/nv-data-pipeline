Assembly Bill No. 344–Assemblymember Marzola
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to judiciary; replacing the term “master” with
“judicial officer” when used to refer to judicial officers who
perform certain duties; prescribing a procedure for the
transfer of child welfare proceedings to a different court
within this State; requiring the appointment of an attorney to
represent certain parties during a child welfare proceeding in
certain circumstances; revising the compensation that an
appointed attorney in certain proceedings is entitled to
receive; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the appointment of a master or special master to
perform certain limited duties in certain proceedings, including family law, juvenile
justice and traffic proceedings and certain proceedings in a justice or municipal
court. (NRS 3.2201, 3.405, 4.357, 5.0245, 33.019, 62B.020, 62B.030, 126.111,
129.080, 159A.0615, 425.381, 432B.455) Sections 3-24, 31-35, 40, 42-47, 52-63,
65, 66, 69-71 and 79 of this bill replace the term “master” with the term “judicial
officer” when used to refer to a judicial official who performs those duties.
Sections 1, 26, 38 and 67 of this bill define the term “judicial officer” for certain
purposes and sections 2, 28, 39 and 68 of this bill establish the applicability of
those definitions. Sections 32, 42, 43, 46-48, 54 and 70 of this bill authorize a
court to designate a different title to a person appointed as a judicial officer so long
as the title does not include the term “master.” Section 4 makes an additional
clarifying change regarding the appointment of judicial officers. Sections 37, 41,
48, 50, 51 and 72-78 of this bill make various other changes so that a judicial
officer retains all of the duties, privileges and protections that such a person
currently has while functioning under the title “master.”
Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of proceedings involving
the legal or physical custody of a child, including child welfare proceedings, to a
court of another state. (NRS 125A.315, 125A.355, 125A.365) Section 27 of this
bill similarly establishes a procedure for the transfer of child welfare proceedings to
a different court in this State. Section 27 requires: (1) the originating court and the
receiving court to hold a joint hearing on the potential transfer; and (2) both courts
to conclude that the transfer would be in the best interests of the child who is the
subject of the proceedings before the transfer may occur. Section 36 of this bill
makes a conforming change to include a reference to section 27 where appropriate.
Sections 29 and 49 of this bill prohibit a person from invoking certain privileges
during a proceeding concerning such a transfer.
Existing law: (1) authorizes an attorney to represent a parent or other person
responsible for the welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the
child at all stages of child welfare proceedings concerning the child; and (2)
requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child who is alleged to have
been abused or neglected at all stages of such proceedings. An appointed attorney is
entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
criminal proceeding. (NRS 432B.420) Section 30 of this bill provides that any
parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child who is taken into
protective custody may be represented during a hearing on protective custody,
-

– 2 –
regardless of whether the parent is alleged to have abused or neglected the child. If
a petition is filed alleging that a child is in need of protection, section 30: (1)
requires the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent or other person
responsible for the welfare of a child who is allegedly responsible for the child
being in need of protection upon determining that the parent or other person is
indigent, except in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the court to appoint an
attorney to represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of the
child who is not allegedly responsible for the child being in need of protection if the
court determines that the parent or other person is indigent and appointment of an
attorney is in the best interest of the child. Section 30 also provides that an attorney
who is appointed to represent a parent or other person responsible for the welfare of
a child or a child in a child welfare proceeding is, except in certain circumstances,
entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all reasonable time and
expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an attorney in the same
jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a misdemeanor.
Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a child and
an indigent parent of a child during any proceeding for terminating or restoring
parental rights. Existing law also requires a court to appoint an attorney to represent
a child in such a proceeding if the child has been placed outside the home because
he or she was deemed to be in need of protection. Such an appointed attorney is
entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses as an attorney, other
than a public defender, selected to represent or defend a defendant at any stage of a
criminal proceeding. (NRS 128.100) Section 64 of this bill provides that such an
appointed attorney is entitled to compensation and payment for expenses for all
reasonable time and expenses spent on the case at a rate not less than the rate an
attorney in the same jurisdiction receives for representing a person charged with a
felony.

to a judge, [master] judicial officer appointed by the court or
referee conducting a hearing pursuant to NRS 126.111. The results
of the test and any sample or specimen taken may be used only for
the purposes specified in this chapter. Unless a party files a written
objection to the result of a test at least 30 days before the hearing at
which the result is to be received in evidence, the result is
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 50 –
admissible as evidence of paternity without foundational testimony
or other proof of authenticity or accuracy. The order for such a test
also may direct that the testimony of the experts and of the persons
so examined may be taken by deposition or written interrogatories.
2. If any party refuses to submit to or fails to appear for a test
ordered pursuant to subsection 1, the court may presume that the
result of the test would be adverse to the interests of that party or

of the evaluation, an appropriate recommendation for settlement
must be made to the parties, which may include any of the
following:
(a) That the action be dismissed with or without prejudice.
(b) That the matter be compromised by an agreement among the
alleged father, the mother and the child, in which the father and
child relationship is not determined but in which a defined economic
obligation, fully secured by payment or otherwise, is undertaken by
the alleged father in favor of the child and, if appropriate, in favor of
the mother, subject to approval by the judge, [master] judicial
