3 278.026-278.029) Existing law also requires each local planning commission responsible for

11 certain cities and counties and provides for the appointment of the members of a planning
12 commission. (NRS 278.030, 278.040) Further, existing law provides the term of each member
13 of a planning commission: (1) is 4 years or until his or her successor takes office; or (2) in a
14 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), is coterminous
