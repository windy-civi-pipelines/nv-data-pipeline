Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the planning commission of a city or county to prepare a
2 comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the city, county or
3 region, which is known as a master plan. Existing law establishes nine certain elements that
4 may be included in a master plan, except that certain cities or counties are required to include
5 all or a portion of certain elements in a master plan. (NRS 278.150-278.170) Section 7 of this
6 bill revises provisions relating to the conservation element, housing element, land use element
7 and safety element of a master plan.
8 Under existing law, the conservation element of a master plan is required to include a
9 conservation plan for the conservation, development and utilization of certain natural
Senate Amendment No. 491 to Senate Bill No. 48 Page 4
10 resources. (NRS 278.160) Section 7 requires that the conservation plan also address the
11 sustainability and resilience of the natural resources included in the conservation plan.
12 Under existing law, the housing element of a master plan is required to include certain
13 inventories, analyses, determinations and plans relating to housing. (NRS 278.160) Section 7
14 adds a requirement for a plan for addressing homelessness.
15 Under existing law, the land use element of a master plan is required to include
16 provisions concerning community design, a land use plan and, in a county whose population is
17 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a rural neighborhoods preservation plan.
18 (NRS 278.160) Section 7 revises the land use plan to require a designation of future land uses
19 for all areas of the city, county or region. Section 7 also revises provisions relating to the land
20 use plan by: (1) clarifying that a land use plan governs the implementation of any zoning
21 regulation or ordinance; (2) requiring a land use plan to indicate the categories and general
22 type of permitted uses; and (3) requiring a land use plan to specify the permitted density or
23 intensity of the use of land.
24 Under existing law, the safety element of a master plan is required to include a seismic
25 safety plan and, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more, a safety plan. (NRS
26 278.160) Section 7 adds a public safety plan that identifies the availability of fire protection,
27 emergency medical services and police services.
28 Section 7 also establishes three additional elements of a master plan, including an
29 economic element, an education element and a public health element. Section 6 of this bill
30 requires the governing body of a city or county in a county whose population is 700,000 or
31 more to adopt a master plan that includes, in addition to certain required elements, the
32 elements established by section 7.
33 Section 3 of this bill sets forth that if a planning commission or governing body finds that
34 a proposed development project in a city, county or region is not consistent with the master
35 plan, the planning commission or governing body may deny or condition approval of the
36 proposed development project to require consistency with the master plan.
37 Existing law requires any local government in a county whose population is 100,000 or
38 more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County) to: (1) make any action relating to
39 development, zoning, the subdivision of land or capital improvements conform to the master
40 plan of the local government; (2) while adopting certain ordinances or regulations, make a
41 specific finding that the ordinance conforms to the master plan; and (3) within 1 year after
42 adoption of any portion of a master plan, to amend any ordinances to ensure the ordinance
43 conforms to the master plan. Existing law also makes clear that the master plan governs any
44 action taken in regard to an application for development, if any regulation relating to land
45 development is inconsistent with the master plan. (NRS 278.0284) Sections 2 and 5 of this bill
46 establish the same provisions for counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
47 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to planning and zoning
48 to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
49 Existing law requires: (1) each local government whose budget includes any expenditure
50 for the acquisition or maintenance of a capital improvement to prepare a plan for capital
51 improvements which conforms with its master plan and which includes at least the 3 ensuing
52 fiscal years but not more than 20 fiscal years; and (2) each local government to annually
53 prepare a capital improvement plan for the fiscal year ending on June 30 of that year and the
54 ensuing 5 fiscal years. (NRS 278.0226, 354.5945) Existing law further requires the governing
55 body of a county or city to put the adopted master plan into effect and that the master plan will
56 serve as a basis for certain decisions. (NRS 278.230) Section 9 of this bill provides that the
57 master plan of the city or county also be a basis for the preparation of the capital improvement
58 plan. Section 9 also requires that the master plan be the basis for zoning ordinances and
59 regulations.
60 Existing law authorizes a governing body to divide the city, county or region into zoning
61 districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out certain purposes.
62 Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the erection,
63 construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land. Zoning
64 regulations must be adopted in accordance with the master plan for land use. (NRS 278.250)
65 Section 10 of this bill requires instead that the zoning regulations be consistent with the
66 master plan for land use.
Senate Amendment No. 491 to Senate Bill No. 48 Page 5
67 Section 11 of this bill requires the governing body or planning commission of the city,
68 county or region to consider conformity with the zoning ordinances and master plan when
69 taking final action on a tentative map.
70 Existing law sets forth certain procedures and requirements relating to the adoption of the
71 master plan, any part of the master plan or any substantial amendment thereof by the
72 commission. (NRS 278.210) Section 8 of this bill adds a requirement that, in counties whose
73 population is 700,000 or more, before the commission may review or adopt any proposed
74 amendment to a land use element of a master plan, the proposed amendment first must be
75 submitted to the staff of the city or county to make a recommendation for approval or denial
76 and establishes the criteria upon which the recommendation must be made.]
77 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing regional planning in a county
78 whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe
79 County). (NRS 278.026-278.029) Existing law also requires each local planning
80 commission responsible for the preparation of a city or county master plan and certain
81 other entities to prepare and submit to the regional planning commission and the
82 governing board for regional planning, an annual report concerning any action taken
83 within the previous calendar year related to the comprehensive regional plan. (NRS
84 278.0286) Section 13 of this bill revises the date on which the annual report is required to
85 be submitted to October 1 and requires the report to indicate certain actions taken
86 within the previous fiscal year.
87 Existing law sets forth certain conditions for the creation of a planning commission
88 by certain cities and counties and provides for the appointment of the members of a
89 planning commission. (NRS 278.030, 278.040) Further, existing law provides the term of
90 each member of a planning commission: (1) is 4 years or until his or her successor takes
91 office; or (2) in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
92 County), is coterminous with the term of the member of the governing body of the
93 county or city who recommended the appointment to the appointing authority. (NRS
94 278.040) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in a
95 county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
96 County), to provide by ordinance that the term of each member of a county or city
97 planning commission is coterminous with the term of the member of the governing body
98 who recommended the appointment to the appointing authority.
99 Existing law provides that: (1) members of a county or city planning commission
100 may be removed for just cause, after a public hearing, by a majority vote of the
101 governing body of the county or city; and (2) in a county whose population is 700,000 or
102 more (currently only Clark County), the members of a county or city planning
103 commission serve at the pleasure of their appointing authority. (NRS 278.040) Section 14
104 authorizes the governing body of a county or city in a county whose population is less
105 than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County), to provide by ordinance
106 that the members of a county or city planning commission serve at the pleasure of their
107 appointing authority.

29 determines to be socially desirable, including, without limitation, developing an
30 area to include a certain proportion of affordable housing.
31 (b) “Inclusionary zoning” means a type of zoning pursuant to which a
32 governing body requires or provides incentives to a developer who builds

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the planning commission of a city or county to prepare a
2 comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the city, county or
3 region, which is known as a master plan. Existing law establishes nine certain elements that
4 may be included in a master plan, except that certain cities or counties are required to include
5 all or a portion of certain elements in a master plan. (NRS 278.150-278.170) Section 7 of this
6 bill revises provisions relating to the conservation element, housing element, land use element
7 and safety element of a master plan.
8 Under existing law, the conservation element of a master plan is required to include a
9 conservation plan for the conservation, development and utilization of certain natural

Senate Amendment No. 491 to Senate Bill No. 48 Page 4
10 resources. (NRS 278.160) Section 7 requires that the conservation plan also address the
11 sustainability and resilience of the natural resources included in the conservation plan.
12 Under existing law, the housing element of a master plan is required to include certain
13 inventories, analyses, determinations and plans relating to housing. (NRS 278.160) Section 7
14 adds a requirement for a plan for addressing homelessness.
15 Under existing law, the land use element of a master plan is required to include
16 provisions concerning community design, a land use plan and, in a county whose population is
17 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a rural neighborhoods preservation plan.
18 (NRS 278.160) Section 7 revises the land use plan to require a designation of future land uses
19 for all areas of the city, county or region. Section 7 also revises provisions relating to the land
20 use plan by: (1) clarifying that a land use plan governs the implementation of any zoning
21 regulation or ordinance; (2) requiring a land use plan to indicate the categories and general
22 type of permitted uses; and (3) requiring a land use plan to specify the permitted density or
23 intensity of the use of land.
24 Under existing law, the safety element of a master plan is required to include a seismic
25 safety plan and, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more, a safety plan. (NRS
26 278.160) Section 7 adds a public safety plan that identifies the availability of fire protection,
27 emergency medical services and police services.
28 Section 7 also establishes three additional elements of a master plan, including an
29 economic element, an education element and a public health element. Section 6 of this bill
30 requires the governing body of a city or county in a county whose population is 700,000 or
31 more to adopt a master plan that includes, in addition to certain required elements, the
32 elements established by section 7.
33 Section 3 of this bill sets forth that if a planning commission or governing body finds that
34 a proposed development project in a city, county or region is not consistent with the master
35 plan, the planning commission or governing body may deny or condition approval of the
36 proposed development project to require consistency with the master plan.
37 Existing law requires any local government in a county whose population is 100,000 or
38 more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County) to: (1) make any action relating to
39 development, zoning, the subdivision of land or capital improvements conform to the master
40 plan of the local government; (2) while adopting certain ordinances or regulations, make a
41 specific finding that the ordinance conforms to the master plan; and (3) within 1 year after
42 adoption of any portion of a master plan, to amend any ordinances to ensure the ordinance
43 conforms to the master plan. Existing law also makes clear that the master plan governs any
44 action taken in regard to an application for development, if any regulation relating to land
45 development is inconsistent with the master plan. (NRS 278.0284) Sections 2 and 5 of this bill
46 establish the same provisions for counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
47 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to planning and zoning
48 to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
49 Existing law requires: (1) each local government whose budget includes any expenditure
50 for the acquisition or maintenance of a capital improvement to prepare a plan for capital
51 improvements which conforms with its master plan and which includes at least the 3 ensuing
52 fiscal years but not more than 20 fiscal years; and (2) each local government to annually
53 prepare a capital improvement plan for the fiscal year ending on June 30 of that year and the
54 ensuing 5 fiscal years. (NRS 278.0226, 354.5945) Existing law further requires the governing
55 body of a county or city to put the adopted master plan into effect and that the master plan will
56 serve as a basis for certain decisions. (NRS 278.230) Section 9 of this bill provides that the
57 master plan of the city or county also be a basis for the preparation of the capital improvement
58 plan. Section 9 also requires that the master plan be the basis for zoning ordinances and
59 regulations.
60 Existing law authorizes a governing body to divide the city, county or region into zoning
61 districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out certain purposes.
62 Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the erection,
63 construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land. Zoning
64 regulations must be adopted in accordance with the master plan for land use. (NRS 278.250)
65 Section 10 of this bill requires instead that the zoning regulations be consistent with the
66 master plan for land use.

Senate Amendment No. 491 to Senate Bill No. 48 Page 5
67 Section 11 of this bill requires the governing body or planning commission of the city,
68 county or region to consider conformity with the zoning ordinances and master plan when
69 taking final action on a tentative map.
70 Existing law sets forth certain procedures and requirements relating to the adoption of the
71 master plan, any part of the master plan or any substantial amendment thereof by the
72 commission. (NRS 278.210) Section 8 of this bill adds a requirement that, in counties whose
73 population is 700,000 or more, before the commission may review or adopt any proposed
74 amendment to a land use element of a master plan, the proposed amendment first must be
75 submitted to the staff of the city or county to make a recommendation for approval or denial
76 and establishes the criteria upon which the recommendation must be made.]
77 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing regional planning in a county
78 whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe
79 County). (NRS 278.026-278.029) Existing law also requires each local planning
80 commission responsible for the preparation of a city or county master plan and certain
81 other entities to prepare and submit to the regional planning commission and the
82 governing board for regional planning, an annual report concerning any action taken
83 within the previous calendar year related to the comprehensive regional plan. (NRS
84 278.0286) Section 13 of this bill revises the date on which the annual report is required to
85 be submitted to October 1 and requires the report to indicate certain actions taken
86 within the previous fiscal year.
87 Existing law sets forth certain conditions for the creation of a planning commission
88 by certain cities and counties and provides for the appointment of the members of a
89 planning commission. (NRS 278.030, 278.040) Further, existing law provides the term of
90 each member of a planning commission: (1) is 4 years or until his or her successor takes
91 office; or (2) in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
92 County), is coterminous with the term of the member of the governing body of the
93 county or city who recommended the appointment to the appointing authority. (NRS
94 278.040) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in a
95 county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
96 County), to provide by ordinance that the term of each member of a county or city
97 planning commission is coterminous with the term of the member of the governing body
98 who recommended the appointment to the appointing authority.
99 Existing law provides that: (1) members of a county or city planning commission
100 may be removed for just cause, after a public hearing, by a majority vote of the
101 governing body of the county or city; and (2) in a county whose population is 700,000 or
102 more (currently only Clark County), the members of a county or city planning
103 commission serve at the pleasure of their appointing authority. (NRS 278.040) Section 14
104 authorizes the governing body of a county or city in a county whose population is less
105 than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County), to provide by ordinance
106 that the members of a county or city planning commission serve at the pleasure of their

29 determines to be socially desirable, including, without limitation, developing an
30 area to include a certain proportion of affordable housing.
31 (b) “Inclusionary zoning” means a type of zoning pursuant to which a
32 governing body requires or provides incentives to a developer who builds
