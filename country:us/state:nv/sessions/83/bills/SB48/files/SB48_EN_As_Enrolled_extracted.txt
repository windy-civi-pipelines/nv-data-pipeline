local planning commissions in certain counties are required
to submit an annual report to the regional planning
commission and the governing board for regional planning;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing regional planning in a
county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only
Washoe County). (NRS 278.026-278.029) Existing law also requires each local
planning commission responsible for the preparation of a city or county master plan
and certain other entities to prepare and submit to the regional planning
commission and the governing board for regional planning, an annual report
concerning any action taken within the previous calendar year related to the
comprehensive regional plan. (NRS 278.0286) Section 13 of this bill revises the
date on which the annual report is required to be submitted to October 1 and
requires the report to indicate certain actions taken within the previous fiscal year.
Existing law sets forth certain conditions for the creation of a planning
commission by certain cities and counties and provides for the appointment of the
members of a planning commission. (NRS 278.030, 278.040) Further, existing law
provides the term of each member of a planning commission: (1) is 4 years or until
his or her successor takes office; or (2) in a county whose population is 700,000 or
more (currently only Clark County), is coterminous with the term of the member of
the governing body of the county or city who recommended the appointment to the
appointing authority. (NRS 278.040) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the
governing body of a county or city in a county whose population is less than
700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County), to provide by ordinance
that the term of each member of a county or city planning commission is
coterminous with the term of the member of the governing body who recommended
the appointment to the appointing authority.
