9 Under existing law, the conservation element of a master plan is required to
10 include a conservation plan for the conservation, development and utilization of
11 certain natural resources. (NRS 278.160) Section 7 requires that the conservation
12 plan also address the sustainability and resilience of the natural resources included
13 in the conservation plan.
14 Under existing law, the housing element of a master plan is required to include
15 certain inventories, analyses, determinations and plans relating to housing. (NRS
16 278.160) Section 7 adds a requirement for a plan for addressing homelessness.
17 Under existing law, the land use element of a master plan is required to include
18 provisions concerning community design, a land use plan and, in a county whose
19 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a rural neighborhoods
20 preservation plan. (NRS 278.160) Section 7 revises the land use plan to require a
21 designation of future land uses for all areas of the city, county or region. Section 7
22 also revises provisions relating to the land use plan by: (1) clarifying that a land use
23 plan governs the implementation of any zoning regulation or ordinance; (2)
24 requiring a land use plan to indicate the categories and general type of permitted
25 uses; and (3) requiring a land use plan to specify the permitted density or intensity
26 of the use of land.
27 Under existing law, the safety element of a master plan is required to include a
28 seismic safety plan and, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more, a safety
29 plan. (NRS 278.160) Section 7 adds a public safety plan that identifies the
30 availability of fire protection, emergency medical services and police services.
31 Section 7 also establishes three additional elements of a master plan, including
32 an economic element, an education element and a public health element. Section 6
33 of this bill requires the governing body of a city or county in a county whose
34 population is 700,000 or more to adopt a master plan that includes, in addition to
35 certain required elements, the elements established by section 7.
36 Section 3 of this bill sets forth that if a planning commission or governing body
37 finds that a proposed development project in a city, county or region is not
38 consistent with the master plan, the planning commission or governing body may
39 deny or condition approval of the proposed development project to require
40 consistency with the master plan.
41 Existing law requires any local government in a county whose population is
42 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County) to: (1)
43 make any action relating to development, zoning, the subdivision of land or capital
44 improvements conform to the master plan of the local government; (2) while
45 adopting certain ordinances or regulations, make a specific finding that the
46 ordinance conforms to the master plan; and (3) within 1 year after adoption of any
47 portion of a master plan, to amend any ordinances to ensure the ordinance conforms
48 to the master plan. Existing law also makes clear that the master plan governs any
49 action taken in regard to an application for development, if any regulation relating
50 to land development is inconsistent with the master plan. (NRS 278.0284) Sections
51 2 and 5 of this bill establish the same provisions for counties whose population is
52 700,000 or more.
53 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to planning
54 and zoning to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
55 Existing law requires: (1) each local government whose budget includes any
56 expenditure for the acquisition or maintenance of a capital improvement to prepare
57 a plan for capital improvements which conforms with its master plan and which

59 each local government to annually prepare a capital improvement plan for the fiscal
60 year ending on June 30 of that year and the ensuing 5 fiscal years. (NRS 278.0226,
61 354.5945) Existing law further requires the governing body of a county or city to
62 put the adopted master plan into effect and that the master plan will serve as a basis
63 for certain decisions. (NRS 278.230) Section 9 of this bill provides that the master
-
*SB48*

– 3 –
64 plan of the city or county also be a basis for the preparation of the capital
65 improvement plan. Section 9 also requires that the master plan be the basis for
66 zoning ordinances and regulations.
67 Existing law authorizes a governing body to divide the city, county or region
68 into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
69 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and
70 restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of
71 buildings, structures or land. Zoning regulations must be adopted in accordance
72 with the master plan for land use. (NRS 278.250) Section 10 of this bill requires
73 instead that the zoning regulations be consistent with the master plan for land use.
74 Section 11 of this bill requires the governing body or planning commission of
75 the city, county or region to consider conformity with the zoning ordinances and
76 master plan when taking final action on a tentative map.
77 Existing law sets forth certain procedures and requirements relating to the
78 adoption of the master plan, any part of the master plan or any substantial
79 amendment thereof by the commission. (NRS 278.210) Section 8 of this bill adds a
80 requirement that, in counties whose population is 700,000 or more, before the
81 commission may review or adopt any proposed amendment to a land use element of
82 a master plan, the proposed amendment first must be submitted to the staff of the
83 city or county to make a recommendation for approval or denial and establishes the
84 criteria upon which the recommendation must be made.
