Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing regional planning in a
2 county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only
3 Washoe County). (NRS 278.026-278.029) Existing law also requires each local
4 planning commission responsible for the preparation of a city or county master plan
5 and certain other entities to prepare and submit to the regional planning
6 commission and the governing board for regional planning, an annual report
7 concerning any action taken within the previous calendar year related to the
8 comprehensive regional plan. (NRS 278.0286) Section 13 of this bill revises the
9 date on which the annual report is required to be submitted to October 1 and
10 requires the report to indicate certain actions taken within the previous fiscal year.
11 Existing law sets forth certain conditions for the creation of a planning
12 commission by certain cities and counties and provides for the appointment of the
13 members of a planning commission. (NRS 278.030, 278.040) Further, existing law
14 provides the term of each member of a planning commission: (1) is 4 years or until
15 his or her successor takes office; or (2) in a county whose population is 700,000 or
16 more (currently only Clark County), is coterminous with the term of the member of
17 the governing body of the county or city who recommended the appointment to the
18 appointing authority. (NRS 278.040) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the
19 governing body of a county or city in a county whose population is less than
