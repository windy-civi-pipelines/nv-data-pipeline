13 Sec. 17. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:

16 State, under certain circumstances, from donating or loaning the
17 State’s money or credit to any company, association or corporation,
18 except corporations formed for educational or charitable purposes.
19 (b) In Employers Insurance Company of Nevada v. State Board
20 of Examiners, 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court
21 held that the State loans its credit in violation of Section 9 of Article
22 8 of the Nevada Constitution only when the State acts as a surety or
23 guarantor for the debts of a company, corporation or association.
24 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 405 (2011), the
25 Nevada Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or
26 “gift” its money in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada
27 Constitution when the State dispenses state funds for public
28 purposes and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
29 consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state funds.
30 (d) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las
31 Vegas, 68 Nev. 84, 93 (1951), and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127
32 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court held that when
33 the Legislature authorizes a state agency to dispense state funds:
34 (1) The courts will carefully examine whether the Legislature
35 made an informed and appropriate finding that the dispensation of
36 the state funds serves a public purpose and the State receives a
37 valuable benefit or fair compensation in exchange for the
38 dispensation;
39 (2) The courts will give great weight and due deference to
40 the Legislature’s finding, and the courts will uphold the
41 Legislature’s finding unless it clearly appears to be erroneous and
42 without reasonable foundations; and
43 (3) The courts will closely examine whether the dispensing
44 state agency reviews all facts, figures and necessary information
-
*AB100_R1*
– 9 –
1 when making the dispensation, and when the state agency has done
2 so, it will not be second-guessed by the courts.
3 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
4 (a) The program developed and carried into effect pursuant to
5 section 11 of this act will not result in the State acting as a surety or
6 guarantor of the debts of an air carrier receiving a grant of money.
7 (b) The purpose of section 11 of this act is to develop and carry
8 into effect a state program to encourage air carriers to resume, retain
9 or enhance the provision of commercial air service to and from
10 small hub airports, nonhub airports and large hub airports that serve
11 rural communities in this State.
12 (c) The provisions of section 11 of this act are intended to serve
13 an important public purpose and ensure that the State receives
14 valuable benefits and fair consideration in exchange for each grant
15 of money from the program because:
16 (1) The program requires the dispensing state agency to
17 review all facts, figures and necessary information when making
18 each grant of money from the program to determine whether the
19 grant will provide economic benefit to the State;
20 (2) The provision of air transportation service to and from
21 small hub airports and nonhub airports enables the citizens and
22 businesses of this State to travel more efficiently, and at lower cost,
23 to and from the rural communities in this State; and
24 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make a grant of
25 money from the program unless the agency receives a commitment
26 from the air carrier receiving the grant to commence or continue air
27 service to a designated small hub airport, nonhub airport or large
28 hub airport that services small hub airports and nonhub airports.
29 3. As used in this section, “air carrier” has the meaning
30 ascribed to it in section 4 of this act.
31 Sec. 18. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing
32 supplements to the Nevada Administrative Code, appropriately
33 change any references to an officer, agency or other entity whose
34 name is changed or whose responsibilities are transferred pursuant
35 to the provisions of this act to refer to the appropriate officer,
36 agency or other entity.
37 Sec. 19. 1. Any administrative regulations adopted by an
38 officer or an agency whose name has been changed or whose
39 responsibilities have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of
40 this act to another officer or agency remain in force until amended
41 by the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the adoption
42 of the regulations has been transferred.
43 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer
44 or agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities
45 have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to
-
*AB100_R1*
– 10 –
1 another officer or agency are binding upon the officer or agency to
2 which the responsibility for the administration of the provisions of
3 the contract or other agreement has been transferred. Such contracts
4 and other agreements may be enforced by the officer or agency to
5 which the responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the
6 contract or other agreement has been transferred.
7 3. Any action taken by an officer or agency whose name has
8 been changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred
9 pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency
10 remains in effect as if taken by the officer or agency to which the
11 responsibility for the enforcement of such actions has been
12 transferred.
13 Sec. 20. Notwithstanding the amendatory provisions of
14 sections 12 and 23 of this act, any person who, on July 1, 2025, was
15 appointed to serve on the Nevada Air Service Development
16 Commission created by NRS 231.680, as that section existed on

22 Fund created by NRS 231.690, as that section existed on June 30,

-
*AB100_R1*

– 8 –
1 2. The amount appropriated by subsection 1 must be used for

3 air service in this State and for the purpose of making grants of
4 money pursuant to section 11 of this act.
5 Sec. 16. 1. There is hereby appropriated from the State
6 General Fund to the Fund for Aviation created by NRS 494.048, as
7 amended by section 14 of this act, the following sums:
8 For the Fiscal Year 2025-2026 ............................... $1,000,000

10 2. The money appropriated by subsection 1 must be used by
11 rural airports to match money that is available from the Federal
12 Aviation Administration.
13 Sec. 17. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
14 (a) Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution contains a
15 provision commonly known as the “gift clause” which restricts the
16 State, under certain circumstances, from donating or loaning the
17 State’s money or credit to any company, association or corporation,
18 except corporations formed for educational or charitable purposes.
19 (b) In Employers Insurance Company of Nevada v. State Board
20 of Examiners, 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court
21 held that the State loans its credit in violation of Section 9 of Article
22 8 of the Nevada Constitution only when the State acts as a surety or
23 guarantor for the debts of a company, corporation or association.
24 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 405 (2011), the
25 Nevada Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or
26 “gift” its money in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada
27 Constitution when the State dispenses state funds for public
28 purposes and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
29 consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state funds.
30 (d) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las
31 Vegas, 68 Nev. 84, 93 (1951), and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127
32 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court held that when
33 the Legislature authorizes a state agency to dispense state funds:
34 (1) The courts will carefully examine whether the Legislature
35 made an informed and appropriate finding that the dispensation of
36 the state funds serves a public purpose and the State receives a
37 valuable benefit or fair compensation in exchange for the
38 dispensation;
39 (2) The courts will give great weight and due deference to
40 the Legislature’s finding, and the courts will uphold the
41 Legislature’s finding unless it clearly appears to be erroneous and
42 without reasonable foundations; and
43 (3) The courts will closely examine whether the dispensing
44 state agency reviews all facts, figures and necessary information
-
*AB100_R1*

– 9 –
1 when making the dispensation, and when the state agency has done
2 so, it will not be second-guessed by the courts.
3 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
4 (a) The program developed and carried into effect pursuant to
5 section 11 of this act will not result in the State acting as a surety or
6 guarantor of the debts of an air carrier receiving a grant of money.
7 (b) The purpose of section 11 of this act is to develop and carry
8 into effect a state program to encourage air carriers to resume, retain
9 or enhance the provision of commercial air service to and from
10 small hub airports, nonhub airports and large hub airports that serve
11 rural communities in this State.
12 (c) The provisions of section 11 of this act are intended to serve
13 an important public purpose and ensure that the State receives
14 valuable benefits and fair consideration in exchange for each grant
15 of money from the program because:
16 (1) The program requires the dispensing state agency to
17 review all facts, figures and necessary information when making
18 each grant of money from the program to determine whether the
19 grant will provide economic benefit to the State;
20 (2) The provision of air transportation service to and from
21 small hub airports and nonhub airports enables the citizens and
22 businesses of this State to travel more efficiently, and at lower cost,
23 to and from the rural communities in this State; and
24 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make a grant of
25 money from the program unless the agency receives a commitment
26 from the air carrier receiving the grant to commence or continue air
27 service to a designated small hub airport, nonhub airport or large
28 hub airport that services small hub airports and nonhub airports.
29 3. As used in this section, “air carrier” has the meaning
30 ascribed to it in section 4 of this act.
31 Sec. 18. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing
32 supplements to the Nevada Administrative Code, appropriately
