31 [Sec. 3.] Sec. 16. 1. There is hereby appropriated from the State General
32 Fund to the Fund for Aviation created by NRS 494.048 , as amended by section 14
33 of this act, the following sums:
34 For the Fiscal Year 2025-2026 ..................................................... $1,000,000

36 2. The money appropriated by subsection 1 must be used by rural airports to
37 match money that is available from the Federal Aviation Administration.
38 Sec. 17. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
39 (a) Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution contains a provision
40 commonly known as the “gift clause” which restricts the State, under certain
41 circumstances, from donating or loaning the State’s money or credit to any
42 company, association or corporation, except corporations formed for
43 educational or charitable purposes.
44 (b) In Employers Insurance Company of Nevada v. State Board of
45 Examiners, 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court held that the
46 State loans its credit in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada
47 Constitution only when the State acts as a surety or guarantor for the debts of
48 a company, corporation or association.
49 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 405 (2011), the Nevada
50 Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or “gift” its money in
51 violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution when the State
52 dispenses state funds for public purposes and the State receives a valuable
Assembly Amendment No. 372 to Assembly Bill No. 100 Page 9
1 benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state
2 funds.
3 (d) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, 68 Nev.
4 84, 93 (1951), and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the
5 Nevada Supreme Court held that when the Legislature authorizes a state
6 agency to dispense state funds:
7 (1) The courts will carefully examine whether the Legislature made an
8 informed and appropriate finding that the dispensation of the state funds
9 serves a public purpose and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
10 compensation in exchange for the dispensation;
11 (2) The courts will give great weight and due deference to the
12 Legislature’s finding, and the courts will uphold the Legislature’s finding
13 unless it clearly appears to be erroneous and without reasonable foundations;
14 and
15 (3) The courts will closely examine whether the dispensing state agency
16 reviews all facts, figures and necessary information when making the
17 dispensation, and when the state agency has done so, it will not be second-
18 guessed by the courts.
19 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
20 (a) The program developed and carried into effect pursuant to section 11
21 of this act will not result in the State acting as a surety or guarantor of the
22 debts of an air carrier receiving a grant of money.
23 (b) The purpose of section 11 of this act is to develop and carry into effect
24 a state program to encourage air carriers to resume, retain or enhance the
25 provision of commercial air service to and from small hub airports, nonhub
26 airports and large hub airports that serve rural communities in this State.
27 (c) The provisions of section 11 of this act are intended to serve an
28 important public purpose and ensure that the State receives valuable benefits
29 and fair consideration in exchange for each grant of money from the program
30 because:
31 (1) The program requires the dispensing state agency to review all
32 facts, figures and necessary information when making each grant of money
33 from the program to determine whether the grant will provide economic
34 benefit to the State;
35 (2) The provision of air transportation service to and from small hub
36 airports and nonhub airports enables the citizens and businesses of this State
37 to travel more efficiently, and at lower cost, to and from the rural communities
38 in this State; and
39 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make a grant of money from
40 the program unless the agency receives a commitment from the air carrier
41 receiving the grant to commence or continue air service to a designated small
42 hub airport, nonhub airport or large hub airport that services small hub
43 airports and nonhub airports.
44 3. As used in this section, “air carrier” has the meaning ascribed to it in
45 section 4 of this act.
46 Sec. 18. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing supplements to the
47 Nevada Administrative Code, appropriately change any references to an
48 officer, agency or other entity whose name is changed or whose responsibilities
49 are transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to refer to the
50 appropriate officer, agency or other entity.
51 Sec. 19. 1. Any administrative regulations adopted by an officer or an
52 agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been
53 transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency
Assembly Amendment No. 372 to Assembly Bill No. 100 Page 10
1 remain in force until amended by the officer or agency to which the
2 responsibility for the adoption of the regulations has been transferred.
3 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer or agency
4 whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred
5 pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency are binding
6 upon the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the administration of
7 the provisions of the contract or other agreement has been transferred. Such
8 contracts and other agreements may be enforced by the officer or agency to
9 which the responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the contract
10 or other agreement has been transferred.
11 3. Any action taken by an officer or agency whose name has been
12 changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred pursuant to the
13 provisions of this act to another officer or agency remains in effect as if taken
14 by the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the enforcement of such
15 actions has been transferred.
16 Sec. 20. Notwithstanding the amendatory provisions of sections 12 and
17 23 of this act, any person who, on July 1, 2025, was appointed to serve on the
18 Nevada Air Service Development Commission created by NRS 231.680, as that

25 Aerospace Development Fund created by section 10 of this act.
26 Sec. 22. The provisions of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to any provision

45 Examiners, 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court held that the
46 State loans its credit in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada
47 Constitution only when the State acts as a surety or guarantor for the debts of
48 a company, corporation or association.
49 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 405 (2011), the Nevada
50 Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or “gift” its money in
51 violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution when the State
52 dispenses state funds for public purposes and the State receives a valuable

Assembly Amendment No. 372 to Assembly Bill No. 100 Page 9
1 benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state
2 funds.
3 (d) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, 68 Nev.
4 84, 93 (1951), and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the
5 Nevada Supreme Court held that when the Legislature authorizes a state
6 agency to dispense state funds:
7 (1) The courts will carefully examine whether the Legislature made an
8 informed and appropriate finding that the dispensation of the state funds
9 serves a public purpose and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
10 compensation in exchange for the dispensation;
11 (2) The courts will give great weight and due deference to the
12 Legislature’s finding, and the courts will uphold the Legislature’s finding
13 unless it clearly appears to be erroneous and without reasonable foundations;
14 and
15 (3) The courts will closely examine whether the dispensing state agency
16 reviews all facts, figures and necessary information when making the
17 dispensation, and when the state agency has done so, it will not be second-
18 guessed by the courts.
19 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
20 (a) The program developed and carried into effect pursuant to section 11
21 of this act will not result in the State acting as a surety or guarantor of the
22 debts of an air carrier receiving a grant of money.
23 (b) The purpose of section 11 of this act is to develop and carry into effect
24 a state program to encourage air carriers to resume, retain or enhance the
25 provision of commercial air service to and from small hub airports, nonhub
26 airports and large hub airports that serve rural communities in this State.
27 (c) The provisions of section 11 of this act are intended to serve an
28 important public purpose and ensure that the State receives valuable benefits
29 and fair consideration in exchange for each grant of money from the program
30 because:
31 (1) The program requires the dispensing state agency to review all
32 facts, figures and necessary information when making each grant of money
33 from the program to determine whether the grant will provide economic
34 benefit to the State;
35 (2) The provision of air transportation service to and from small hub
36 airports and nonhub airports enables the citizens and businesses of this State
37 to travel more efficiently, and at lower cost, to and from the rural communities
38 in this State; and
39 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make a grant of money from
40 the program unless the agency receives a commitment from the air carrier
41 receiving the grant to commence or continue air service to a designated small
42 hub airport, nonhub airport or large hub airport that services small hub
43 airports and nonhub airports.
44 3. As used in this section, “air carrier” has the meaning ascribed to it in
45 section 4 of this act.
46 Sec. 18. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing supplements to the
47 Nevada Administrative Code, appropriately change any references to an
48 officer, agency or other entity whose name is changed or whose responsibilities
49 are transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to refer to the
50 appropriate officer, agency or other entity.
51 Sec. 19. 1. Any administrative regulations adopted by an officer or an
52 agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been
53 transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency

Assembly Amendment No. 372 to Assembly Bill No. 100 Page 10
1 remain in force until amended by the officer or agency to which the
2 responsibility for the adoption of the regulations has been transferred.
3 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer or agency
4 whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred
5 pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency are binding
6 upon the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the administration of
7 the provisions of the contract or other agreement has been transferred. Such
8 contracts and other agreements may be enforced by the officer or agency to
9 which the responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the contract
10 or other agreement has been transferred.
11 3. Any action taken by an officer or agency whose name has been
12 changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred pursuant to the
13 provisions of this act to another officer or agency remains in effect as if taken
14 by the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the enforcement of such
15 actions has been transferred.
16 Sec. 20. Notwithstanding the amendatory provisions of sections 12 and
17 23 of this act, any person who, on July 1, 2025, was appointed to serve on the
18 Nevada Air Service Development Commission created by NRS 231.680, as that
19 section existed on June 30, 2025, may continue to serve in that capacity until
20 his or her term would ordinarily expire pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS
21 231.680, as that section existed on June 30, 2025.
22 Sec. 21. On July 1, 2025, the State Controller shall transfer any
23 unexpended balance in the Nevada Air Service Development Fund created by
24 NRS 231.690, as that section existed on June 30, 2025, to the Nevada
25 Aerospace Development Fund created by section 10 of this act.
26 Sec. 22. The provisions of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to any provision
27 of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to the
28 Legislature.
29 Sec. 23. NRS 231.600, 231.610, 231.620, 231.630, 231.650, 231.655,
30 231.665, 231.680, 231.690, 231.700, 231.710, 231.720 and 231.730 are hereby
31 repealed.
32 [Sec. 4.] Sec. 24. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
