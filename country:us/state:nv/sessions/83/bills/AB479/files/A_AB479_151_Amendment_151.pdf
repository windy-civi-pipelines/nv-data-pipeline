AN ACT relating to taxation of property; revising provisions relating to the taxation
of the agricultural use of real property to include agrivoltaic purposes;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution authorizes the Legislature to constitute
2 agricultural and open-space real property as a separate class for taxation purposes and provide
3 a separate plan for the appraisal and valuation of such property for assessment purposes.
4 Existing law constitutes such property as a separate class and provides for the partial deferred
5 taxation of such property. (NRS 361A.090, 361A.280, 361A.283) Under existing law, an
6 owner of real property may file an application for agricultural use assessment with the county
7 assessor or the Department of Taxation, in certain circumstances, who, upon receipt of the
8 application, is required to make an independent determination of the use of the owner’s
9 property. (NRS 361A.100, 361A.110, 361A.120) Further, under existing law, if the property is
10 found to be agricultural real property, the county assessor is required to determine the value
11 for agricultural use and assess it for taxes to be collected in the ensuing fiscal year at 35
12 percent of that value, utilizing certain classifications of agricultural real property defined by
13 the Nevada Tax Commission determined on certain bases each year. (NRS 361A.130,
14 361A.140) [This] Section 3 of this bill establishes that agrivoltaic purposes is an agricultural
15 use for the purposes of determining the taxation of agricultural real property . [and] Section 2
16 of this bill defines the term “agrivoltaic purposes” to mean a system under which solar energy
17 production and agricultural [production, including crop or animal production,] use occurs in
18 an integrated manner on the same piece of land [.] and which incorporates designs,
19 technologies or configurations conducive to integrating agricultural activities. Section 4
20 provides that land used for agrivoltaic purposes may be the current employment of real
21 property in agricultural use only if, before July 1, 2025, the land was found to be
22 agricultural real property and qualified for agricultural use assessment.
23 Section 5 of this bill prohibits an owner of real property from applying to the county
24 assessor for agricultural use assessment if the current employment of the real property
25 in agricultural use includes land used for agrivoltaic purposes and the solar energy

Assembly Amendment No. 151 to Assembly Bill No. 479 Page 4
26 production use occurring on the land is receiving an abatement of taxes for certain
27 purposes.
28 Section 6 of this bill provides that if the agricultural real property includes land
29 used for agrivoltaic purposes, the value of the land for agricultural use in a fiscal year
30 for taxation purposes must be determined by considering the integrated use of the land
31 for agricultural purposes and solar energy production.
32 Section 3 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 2 relating to
33 taxes on agricultural real property and open space to the provisions of this bill.
