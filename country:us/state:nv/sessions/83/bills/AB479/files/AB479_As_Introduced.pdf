EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation of property; revising provisions
relating to the taxation of the agricultural use of real
property to include agrivoltaic purposes; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of article 10 of the Nevada Constitution authorizes the Legislature to
2 constitute agricultural and open-space real property as a separate class for taxation
3 purposes and provide a separate plan for the appraisal and valuation of such
4 property for assessment purposes. Existing law constitutes such property as a
5 separate class and provides for the partial deferred taxation of such property. (NRS
6 361A.090, 361A.280, 361A.283) Under existing law, an owner of real property
7 may file an application for agricultural use assessment with the county assessor or
8 the Department of Taxation, in certain circumstances, who, upon receipt of the
9 application, is required to make an independent determination of the use of the
10 owner’s property. (NRS 361A.100, 361A.110, 361A.120) Further, under existing
11 law, if the property is found to be agricultural real property, the county assessor is
12 required to determine the value for agricultural use and assess it for taxes to be
13 collected in the ensuing fiscal year at 35 percent of that value, utilizing certain
14 classifications of agricultural real property defined by the Nevada Tax Commission
15 determined on certain bases each year. (NRS 361A.130, 361A.140) This bill
16 establishes that agrivoltaic purposes is an agricultural use for the purposes of
17 determining the taxation of agricultural real property and defines the term
18 “agrivoltaic purposes” to mean a system under which solar energy production and
19 agricultural production, including crop or animal production, occurs in an
20 integrated manner on the same piece of land.
