Section 1:
on Growth and Infrastructure
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation of property; revising provisions
relating to the taxation of the agricultural use of real property
to include agrivoltaic purposes; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

Section 2:
Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution authorizes the Legislature to
constitute agricultural and open-space real property as a separate class for taxation
purposes and provide a separate plan for the appraisal and valuation of such
property for assessment purposes. Existing law constitutes such property as a
separate class and provides for the partial deferred taxation of such property. (NRS
361A.090, 361A.280, 361A.283) Under existing law, an owner of real property
may file an application for agricultural use assessment with the county assessor or
the Department of Taxation, in certain circumstances, who, upon receipt of the
application, is required to make an independent determination of the use of the
owner’s property. (NRS 361A.100, 361A.110, 361A.120) Further, under existing
law, if the property is found to be agricultural real property, the county assessor is
required to determine the value for agricultural use and assess it for taxes to be
collected in the ensuing fiscal year at 35 percent of that value, utilizing certain
classifications of agricultural real property defined by the Nevada Tax Commission
determined on certain bases each year. (NRS 361A.130, 361A.140) Section 3 of
this bill establishes that agrivoltaic purposes is an agricultural use for the purposes
of determining the taxation of agricultural real property. Section 2 of this bill
defines the term “agrivoltaic purposes” to mean a system under which solar energy
production and agricultural use occurs in an integrated manner on the same piece of
land and which incorporates designs, technologies or configurations conducive to
integrating agricultural activities. Section 4 provides that land used for agrivoltaic
purposes may be the current employment of real property in agricultural use only if,
before July 1, 2025, the land was found to be agricultural real property and
qualified for agricultural use assessment.

Section 3:
Section 5 of this bill prohibits an owner of real property from applying to the
county assessor for agricultural use assessment if the current employment of
the real property in agricultural use includes land used for agrivoltaic purposes and
the solar energy production use occurring on the land is receiving an abatement of
taxes for certain purposes.

Section 4:
Section 6 of this bill provides that if the agricultural real property includes land
used for agrivoltaic purposes, the value of the land for agricultural use in a fiscal
year for taxation purposes must be determined by considering the integrated use of
the land for agricultural purposes and solar energy production.

Section 5:
Section 3 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 2
relating to taxes on agricultural real property and open space to the provisions of
this bill.
