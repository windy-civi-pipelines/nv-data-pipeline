AN ACT relating to taxation of property; revising provisions
relating to the taxation of the agricultural use of real
property to include agrivoltaic purposes; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution authorizes the Legislature to
2 constitute agricultural and open-space real property as a separate class for taxation
3 purposes and provide a separate plan for the appraisal and valuation of such
4 property for assessment purposes. Existing law constitutes such property as a
5 separate class and provides for the partial deferred taxation of such property. (NRS
6 361A.090, 361A.280, 361A.283) Under existing law, an owner of real property
7 may file an application for agricultural use assessment with the county assessor or
8 the Department of Taxation, in certain circumstances, who, upon receipt of the
9 application, is required to make an independent determination of the use of the
10 owner’s property. (NRS 361A.100, 361A.110, 361A.120) Further, under existing
11 law, if the property is found to be agricultural real property, the county assessor is
12 required to determine the value for agricultural use and assess it for taxes to be
13 collected in the ensuing fiscal year at 35 percent of that value, utilizing certain
14 classifications of agricultural real property defined by the Nevada Tax Commission
15 determined on certain bases each year. (NRS 361A.130, 361A.140) Section 3 of
16 this bill establishes that agrivoltaic purposes is an agricultural use for the purposes
17 of determining the taxation of agricultural real property. Section 2 of this bill
18 defines the term “agrivoltaic purposes” to mean a system under which solar energy
19 production and agricultural use occurs in an integrated manner on the same piece of
20 land and which incorporates designs, technologies or configurations conducive to
-
*AB479_R1*
– 2 –
21 integrating agricultural activities. Section 4 provides that land used for agrivoltaic
22 purposes may be the current employment of real property in agricultural use only if,
23 before July 1, 2025, the land was found to be agricultural real property and
24 qualified for agricultural use assessment.
25 Section 5 of this bill prohibits an owner of real property from applying to the
26 county assessor for agricultural use assessment if the current employment of
27 the real property in agricultural use includes land used for agrivoltaic purposes and
28 the solar energy production use occurring on the land is receiving an abatement of
29 taxes for certain purposes.
30 Section 6 of this bill provides that if the agricultural real property includes land
31 used for agrivoltaic purposes, the value of the land for agricultural use in a fiscal
32 year for taxation purposes must be determined by considering the integrated use of
33 the land for agricultural purposes and solar energy production.
34 Section 3 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 2
35 relating to taxes on agricultural real property and open space to the provisions of
36 this bill.
