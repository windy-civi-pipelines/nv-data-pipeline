AN ACT relating to employment; establishing and revising
restrictions on the number of hours that a child under the
age of 18 years may work; limiting the times of day that a
child under the age of 18 years who is enrolled in a public
school or private school may work on any day in which,
or any day immediately preceding a day in which, the
school is in session; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, in general, prohibits employing, permitting or requiring a child
2 under the age of 16 years to work in any occupation, other than as a performer in
3 the production of a motion picture or work on a farm, for more than 48 hours in any
4 1 week or more than 8 hours in any 1 day. (NRS 609.240) This bill expands that
5 prohibition to include children under the age of 18 years and reduces, from 48 to
6 40, the maximum number of hours per week that a child under the age of 18 years
7 may work. Additionally, if a child under the age of 18 years is enrolled in a public
8 school or private school, this bill prohibits employing, permitting or requiring the
9 child to work before 5 a.m. on any day in which the school is in session and after
10 10 p.m. on any day immediately preceding such a day. This bill maintains the
11 exception from those restrictions provided under existing law for work as a
12 performer in the production of a motion picture or work on a farm.
