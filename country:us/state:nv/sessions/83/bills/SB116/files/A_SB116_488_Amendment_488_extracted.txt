EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising provisions relating to the annual
compensation of elected county officers; [requiring] authorizing the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs to [conduct
certain interim studies concerning] review certain issues relating to
county commissions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the annual compensation to be paid to county commissioners and
2 certain elected county officers, including district attorneys, sheriffs, county clerks, county
3 assessors, county recorders, county treasurers and public administrators. (NRS 245.043)
4 Section 1 of this bill sets the base amount of compensation of elected county officers for: (1)
5 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 as an amount based on a certain calculation using the base salary
6 that was in effect for Fiscal Year 2018-2019 or 3 percent higher than the highest salary of
7 an employee under the supervision of the elected officer that was in effect on January 1, 2025
8 [;] , whichever is higher; and (2) each fiscal year thereafter as the base salary in effect for
9 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 with certain adjustments or 3 percent higher than the highest salary
10 of an employee under the supervision of the elected officer that has been approved by the
11 board of county commissioners [.] whichever is higher. Section 1 also [eliminates the
12 authority of] authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide, on an annual basis
13 or as the board of county commissioners deems appropriate, a 2 percent cost-of-living
14 increase to the base salary of each elected county officer.
15 Existing law further authorizes the board of county commissioners to determine not to
16 pay the increased salary for all elected county officers if the financial resources of the county
17 are not available to pay the increased salaries in that fiscal year. (NRS 245.043) If the board
18 of county commissioners determines not to pay the increased salary for all elected
19 county officers, including county commissioners, section 1 requires that any reduction in
20 salary be applied to all elected county officers using a calculation that is equally
21 proportional for each elected county officer or using the same reduction calculation
22 applied to any other employee or group of employees of the county, whichever is lower.
23 Section 1 further: (1) establishes the amount of the annual salaries for county
24 commissioners for Fiscal Year 2025-2026; and (2) provides that for the 5 fiscal years
Senate Amendment No. 488 to Senate Bill No. 116 Page 4
25 following Fiscal Year 2025-2026, each county commissioner is entitled to an increase in the
26 amount of his or her annual salary of 3 percent per fiscal year.
27 [Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that the Mayor of Carson
28 City is entitled to the amount of compensation set forth in section 1.]
29 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, district attorneys in every county except a
30 county in classification 6 of the table of annual salaries (currently Esmeralda County) from
31 engaging in the private practice of law. (NRS 245.0435, 252.060) Section 1 eliminates the
32 table and related classifications and sections 2 and 4 of this bill replace references to the
33 classifications to apply the exception to a county whose population is less than 3,000
34 (currently Esmeralda and Eureka Counties).
35 Sections 3 and [6-10] 5-10 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the
36 change in how compensation for elected county officers is determined in section 1.
37 [Sections] Section 11 [and 12] of this bill [require] authorizes the Joint Interim Standing
38 Committee on Government Affairs to [conduct certain studies] review certain issues during
39 the 2025-2026 [and 2027-2028 interims] interim concerning county commissions.

16 by the salaries of all employees under the supervision of the elected officer on
17 January 1, 2025 [.] , whichever is higher. For each fiscal year thereafter, the

16 use a cost-of-living increase as a one-time pay incentive or bonus to increase the
17 base salary of an elected officer in such a manner that would prevent an increase
18 to the base salary of a person elected to such office at a later date.

25 more than 3 percent more than the salary of the employee under the supervision

27 supervision of the elected officer.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 3, 5-10)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising provisions relating to the annual
compensation of elected county officers; [requiring] authorizing the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs to [conduct
certain interim studies concerning] review certain issues relating to
county commissions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the annual compensation to be paid to county commissioners and
2 certain elected county officers, including district attorneys, sheriffs, county clerks, county
3 assessors, county recorders, county treasurers and public administrators. (NRS 245.043)
4 Section 1 of this bill sets the base amount of compensation of elected county officers for: (1)
5 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 as an amount based on a certain calculation using the base salary
6 that was in effect for Fiscal Year 2018-2019 or 3 percent higher than the highest salary of
7 an employee under the supervision of the elected officer that was in effect on January 1, 2025
8 [;] , whichever is higher; and (2) each fiscal year thereafter as the base salary in effect for
9 Fiscal Year 2025-2026 with certain adjustments or 3 percent higher than the highest salary
10 of an employee under the supervision of the elected officer that has been approved by the
11 board of county commissioners [.] whichever is higher. Section 1 also [eliminates the
12 authority of] authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide, on an annual basis
13 or as the board of county commissioners deems appropriate, a 2 percent cost-of-living
14 increase to the base salary of each elected county officer.
15 Existing law further authorizes the board of county commissioners to determine not to
16 pay the increased salary for all elected county officers if the financial resources of the county
17 are not available to pay the increased salaries in that fiscal year. (NRS 245.043) If the board
18 of county commissioners determines not to pay the increased salary for all elected
19 county officers, including county commissioners, section 1 requires that any reduction in
20 salary be applied to all elected county officers using a calculation that is equally
21 proportional for each elected county officer or using the same reduction calculation
22 applied to any other employee or group of employees of the county, whichever is lower.
23 Section 1 further: (1) establishes the amount of the annual salaries for county
24 commissioners for Fiscal Year 2025-2026; and (2) provides that for the 5 fiscal years

Senate Amendment No. 488 to Senate Bill No. 116 Page 4
25 following Fiscal Year 2025-2026, each county commissioner is entitled to an increase in the
26 amount of his or her annual salary of 3 percent per fiscal year.
27 [Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that the Mayor of Carson
28 City is entitled to the amount of compensation set forth in section 1.]
29 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, district attorneys in every county except a
30 county in classification 6 of the table of annual salaries (currently Esmeralda County) from
31 engaging in the private practice of law. (NRS 245.0435, 252.060) Section 1 eliminates the
32 table and related classifications and sections 2 and 4 of this bill replace references to the
33 classifications to apply the exception to a county whose population is less than 3,000
34 (currently Esmeralda and Eureka Counties).
35 Sections 3 and [6-10] 5-10 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the
36 change in how compensation for elected county officers is determined in section 1.
37 [Sections] Section 11 [and 12] of this bill [require] authorizes the Joint Interim Standing
38 Committee on Government Affairs to [conduct certain studies] review certain issues during
39 the 2025-2026 [and 2027-2028 interims] interim concerning county commissions.
