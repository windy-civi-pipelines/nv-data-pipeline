(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising provisions relating to the
annual compensation of elected county officers;
authorizing the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
Government Affairs to review certain issues relating to
county commissions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the annual compensation to be paid to county
2 commissioners and certain elected county officers, including district attorneys,
3 sheriffs, county clerks, county assessors, county recorders, county treasurers and
4 public administrators. (NRS 245.043) Section 1 of this bill sets the base amount of
5 compensation of elected county officers for: (1) Fiscal Year 2025-2026 as an
6 amount based on a certain calculation using the base salary that was in effect for
7 Fiscal Year 2018-2019 or 3 percent higher than the highest salary of an employee
8 under the supervision of the elected officer that was in effect on January 1, 2025,
9 whichever is higher; and (2) each fiscal year thereafter as the base salary in effect
10 for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 with certain adjustments or 3 percent higher than the
11 highest salary of an employee under the supervision of the elected officer that has
12 been approved by the board of county commissioners, whichever is higher. Section
13 1 also authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide, on an annual basis or
14 as the board of county commissioners deems appropriate, a 2 percent cost-of-living
15 increase to the base salary of each elected county officer.
16 Existing law further authorizes the board of county commissioners to determine
17 not to pay the increased salary for all elected county officers if the financial
18 resources of the county are not available to pay the increased salaries in that fiscal
19 year. (NRS 245.043) If the board of county commissioners determines not to pay
20 the increased salary for all elected county officers, including county
-
*SB116_R1*

– 2 –
21 commissioners, section 1 requires that any reduction in salary be applied to all
22 elected county officers using a calculation that is equally proportional for each
23 elected county officer or using the same reduction calculation applied to any other
24 employee or group of employees of the county, whichever is lower.
25 Section 1 further: (1) establishes the amount of the annual salaries for county
26 commissioners for Fiscal Year 2025-2026; and (2) provides that for the 5 fiscal
27 years following Fiscal Year 2025-2026, each county commissioner is entitled to an
28 increase in the amount of his or her annual salary of 3 percent per fiscal year.
29 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, district attorneys in every
30 county except a county in classification 6 of the table of annual salaries (currently
31 Esmeralda County) from engaging in the private practice of law. (NRS 245.0435,
32 252.060) Section 1 eliminates the table and related classifications and sections 2
33 and 4 of this bill replace references to the classifications to apply the exception to a
34 county whose population is less than 3,000 (currently Esmeralda and Eureka
35 Counties).
36 Sections 3 and 5-10 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the
37 change in how compensation for elected county officers is determined in section 1.
38 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
39 Government Affairs to review certain issues during the 2025-2026 interim
40 concerning county commissions.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

2 245.043 1. As used in this section:
3 (a) “County” includes Carson City.
4 (b) “County commissioner” includes the Mayor and supervisors
5 of Carson City.
6 (c) “Elected officer” means a district attorney, sheriff, county
7 clerk, county assessor, county recorder, county treasurer and
8 public administrator.
9 2. Except as otherwise provided in [subsection 5 and by any
10 special law, the] this section, each elected [officers] officer of [the
11 counties] a county of this State [are] is entitled to receive [,] for [the
12 appropriate fiscal year,] Fiscal Year 2025-2026, an annual [salaries]
13 salary in the base [amounts specified in the following table
14 commencing on July 1 of the fiscal year.] amount as determined
15 pursuant to subsection 3 or an amount that is calculated to be 3
16 percent more than the salary of the employee under the
17 supervision of the elected officer who has the highest salary of all
18 employees under the supervision of the elected officer, as
19 determined by the salaries of all employees under the supervision
20 of the elected officer on January 1, 2025, whichever is higher. For
21 each fiscal year thereafter, the annual salary of an elected officer
22 is the base salary for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 as adjusted pursuant
23 to subsection 4 or an amount that is calculated to be 3 percent
24 more than the salary of the employee under the supervision of the
-
*SB116_R1*

– 3 –
1 elected officer who has the highest salary of all employees under
2 the supervision of the elected officer, as determined by the salaries
3 of all employees under the supervision of the elected officer on
4 July 1 of that fiscal year that have been approved by the board of
5 county commissioners, whichever is higher. The annual [salaries
6 are] salary is in full payment for all services required by law to be
7 performed by such [officers.] elected officer. Except as otherwise
8 provided by law, all fees and commissions collected by [such]
9 elected officers in the performance of their duties must be paid into
10 the county treasury each month without deduction of any nature.
11 For the purposes of this subsection, approval of a salary by a
12 board of county commissioners includes, without limitation, the
13 approval of a salary or pay increase where the board of county
14 commissioners:
15 (a) Was informed that the salary or pay increase would
16 increase the salary of an elected officer;
17 (b) Approved a collective bargaining agreement; or
18 (c) Approved a range of salaries for the department or division
19 that includes the position of the elected officer.
20 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the base
21 salary for each elected officer for Fiscal Year 2025-2026, is the
22 base salary that was in effect for Fiscal Year 2018-2019 pursuant
23 to this section, as it existed on July 1, 2015, adjusted for each
24 fiscal year starting with Fiscal Year 2019-2020 and ending with
25 Fiscal Year 2024-2025 by compounding the annual percentage
26 increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers,
27 West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
28 Department of Labor.
29 4. A board of county commissioners may elect to provide a
30 cost-of-living increase of 2 percent to the base salary of each
31 elected officer. Such an increase may be provided annually or at
32 any time the board of county commissioners deems appropriate.
33 Each time the board of county commissioners provides such an
34 increase, the total increased salary becomes the base salary for
35 that elected officer for purposes of this section. A board of county
36 commissioners shall not use a cost-of-living increase as a one-time
37 pay incentive or bonus to increase the base salary of an elected
38 officer in such a manner that would prevent an increase to the
39 base salary of a person elected to such office at a later date.
40 5. The base salary of an elected officer as determined
41 pursuant to subsections 2, 3 and 4 does not:
42 (a) Include any increases to the salary of an elected officer for
43 longevity under NRS 245.044;
44 (b) Decrease when a new person is elected to that office; and
-
*SB116_R1*

– 4 –
1 (c) Decrease when a person who is elected and has a base
2 salary which is more than 3 percent more than the salary of the
3 employee under the supervision of the elected officer who has the
4 highest salary of all employees under the supervision of the elected
5 officer.
