Senate Bill No. 116–Senator Daly
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to counties; revising provisions relating to the
annual compensation of elected county officers; authorizing
the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs
to review certain issues relating to county commissions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth the annual compensation to be paid to county
commissioners and certain elected county officers, including district attorneys,
sheriffs, county clerks, county assessors, county recorders, county treasurers and
public administrators. (NRS 245.043) Section 1 of this bill sets the base amount of
compensation of elected county officers for: (1) Fiscal Year 2025-2026 as an
amount based on a certain calculation using the base salary that was in effect for
Fiscal Year 2018-2019 or 3 percent higher than the highest salary of an employee
under the supervision of the elected officer that was in effect on January 1, 2025,
whichever is higher; and (2) each fiscal year thereafter as the base salary in effect
for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 with certain adjustments or 3 percent higher than the
highest salary of an employee under the supervision of the elected officer that has
been approved by the board of county commissioners, whichever is higher. Section
1 also authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide, on an annual basis or
as the board of county commissioners deems appropriate, a 2 percent cost-of-living
increase to the base salary of each elected county officer.
Existing law further authorizes the board of county commissioners to determine
not to pay the increased salary for all elected county officers if the financial
resources of the county are not available to pay the increased salaries in that fiscal
year. (NRS 245.043) If the board of county commissioners determines not to pay
the increased salary for all elected county officers, including county
commissioners, section 1 requires that any reduction in salary be applied to all
elected county officers using a calculation that is equally proportional for each
elected county officer or using the same reduction calculation applied to any other
employee or group of employees of the county, whichever is lower.
Section 1 further: (1) establishes the amount of the annual salaries for county
commissioners for Fiscal Year 2025-2026; and (2) provides that for the 5 fiscal
years following Fiscal Year 2025-2026, each county commissioner is entitled to an
increase in the amount of his or her annual salary of 3 percent per fiscal year.
Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, district attorneys in every
county except a county in classification 6 of the table of annual salaries (currently
Esmeralda County) from engaging in the private practice of law. (NRS 245.0435,
252.060) Section 1 eliminates the table and related classifications and sections 2
and 4 of this bill replace references to the classifications to apply the exception to a
county whose population is less than 3,000 (currently Esmeralda and Eureka
Counties).
Sections 3 and 5-10 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the
change in how compensation for elected county officers is determined in section 1.
Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
Government Affairs to review certain issues during the 2025-2026 interim
concerning county commissions.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 245.043 is hereby amended to read as follows:
245.043 1. As used in this section:
(a) “County” includes Carson City.
(b) “County commissioner” includes the Mayor and supervisors
of Carson City.
(c) “Elected officer” means a district attorney, sheriff, county
clerk, county assessor, county recorder, county treasurer and
public administrator.
2. Except as otherwise provided in [subsection 5 and by any
special law, the] this section, each elected [officers] officer of [the
counties] a county of this State [are] is entitled to receive [,] for [the
appropriate fiscal year,] Fiscal Year 2025-2026, an annual [salaries]
salary in the base [amounts specified in the following table
commencing on July 1 of the fiscal year.] amount as determined
pursuant to subsection 3 or an amount that is calculated to be 3
percent more than the salary of the employee under the
supervision of the elected officer who has the highest salary of all
employees under the supervision of the elected officer, as
determined by the salaries of all employees under the supervision
of the elected officer on January 1, 2025, whichever is higher. For
each fiscal year thereafter, the annual salary of an elected officer
is the base salary for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 as adjusted pursuant
to subsection 4 or an amount that is calculated to be 3 percent
more than the salary of the employee under the supervision of the
elected officer who has the highest salary of all employees under
the supervision of the elected officer, as determined by the salaries
of all employees under the supervision of the elected officer on
July 1 of that fiscal year that have been approved by the board of
county commissioners, whichever is higher. The annual [salaries
are] salary is in full payment for all services required by law to be
performed by such [officers.] elected officer. Except as otherwise
provided by law, all fees and commissions collected by [such]
elected officers in the performance of their duties must be paid into
the county treasury each month without deduction of any nature.
For the purposes of this subsection, approval of a salary by a
board of county commissioners includes, without limitation, the
approval of a salary or pay increase where the board of county
commissioners:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
(a) Was informed that the salary or pay increase would
increase the salary of an elected officer;
(b) Approved a collective bargaining agreement; or
(c) Approved a range of salaries for the department or division
that includes the position of the elected officer.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the base
salary for each elected officer for Fiscal Year 2025-2026, is the
base salary that was in effect for Fiscal Year 2018-2019 pursuant
to this section, as it existed on July 1, 2015, adjusted for each
fiscal year starting with Fiscal Year 2019-2020 and ending with
Fiscal Year 2024-2025 by compounding the annual percentage
increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers,
West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
Department of Labor.
4. A board of county commissioners may elect to provide a
cost-of-living increase of 2 percent to the base salary of each
elected officer. Such an increase may be provided annually or at
any time the board of county commissioners deems appropriate.
Each time the board of county commissioners provides such an
increase, the total increased salary becomes the base salary for
that elected officer for purposes of this section. A board of county
commissioners shall not use a cost-of-living increase as a one-time
pay incentive or bonus to increase the base salary of an elected
officer in such a manner that would prevent an increase to the
base salary of a person elected to such office at a later date.
5. The base salary of an elected officer as determined
pursuant to subsections 2, 3 and 4 does not:
(a) Include any increases to the salary of an elected officer for
longevity under NRS 245.044;
(b) Decrease when a new person is elected to that office; and
(c) Decrease when a person who is elected and has a base
salary which is more than 3 percent more than the salary of the
employee under the supervision of the elected officer who has the
highest salary of all employees under the supervision of the elected
officer.
