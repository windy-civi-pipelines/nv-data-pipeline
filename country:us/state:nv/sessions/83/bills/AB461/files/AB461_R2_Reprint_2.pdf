EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to powers of attorney; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services, acting through the Aging
and Disability Services Division of the Department, to
conduct a program to educate and inform residents of this
State concerning planning for long-term care; requesting
the Guardianship Commission created by the Nevada
Supreme Court to study and make recommendations
relating to the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to provide certain services to aging
3 persons and persons with disabilities. (Chapters 427A and 435 of NRS) Section 60
4 of this bill requires the Department, through the Division, to conduct a program to
5 educate and inform residents of this State concerning planning for long-term care.
6 Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for
7 health care decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person
8 may create an advance health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power
9 of attorney for health care, by using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care
10 Decisions Act. (NRS 162A.715, 162A.855) Existing law also contains definitions
11 from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of “guardian,” “health care” and
12 “nursing home.” Section 80.5 of this bill requests that the Guardianship
13 Commission created by the Nevada Supreme Court: (1) examine the remaining
14 provisions of the Uniform Act and the implementation of the Act in other
15 jurisdictions; and (2) make recommendations to the Joint Interim Standing
16 Committee on Health and Human Services concerning the potential enactment of
17 the Uniform Act in this State.
