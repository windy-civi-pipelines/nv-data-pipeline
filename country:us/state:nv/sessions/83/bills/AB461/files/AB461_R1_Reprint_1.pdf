AN ACT relating to powers of attorney; enacting the provisions of
the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act that have not
been enacted into law in this State; revising various
provisions relating to powers of attorney for health care to
conform with the Uniform Act; requiring the Department
of Health and Human Services, acting through the Aging
and Disability Services Division of the Department, to
conduct a program to educate and inform residents of this
State concerning planning for long-term care; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for
2 health care decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person
3 may create an advance health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power
4 of attorney for health care, by using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care
5 Decisions Act. (NRS 162A.715, 162A.855) Existing law also contains definitions
6 from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of “guardian,” “health care” and
7 “nursing home.” This bill replaces other provisions of existing law relating to
8 powers of attorney for health care with the remaining provisions of the Uniform
9 Health-Care Decisions Act that have been enacted into law.
10 Section 28 of this bill provides that an individual has capacity to make health
11 care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive if the
12 individual: (1) is willing and able to communicate a decision independently or with
13 appropriate services, technological assistance, supported decision making or other
14 reasonable accommodations; and (2) understands the nature and consequences of
15 the action, including, with limitation, the risks and benefits of the action, or, if the
16 individual is appointing an agent to make health care decisions for the individual,
17 the individual recognizes the identity of the individual being appointed and
-
*AB461_R1*

– 2 –
18 understands the general nature of the relationship with the individual being
19 appointed. Under section 29 of this bill, an individual is presumed to have capacity
20 to make health care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive,
21 unless certain health care professionals or a court determine that the individual does
22 not have such capacity. Sections 30 and 31 of this bill require certain notice of a
23 finding that an individual lacks capacity, authorize an individual to object to the
24 finding that the individual lacks capacity and authorize certain persons to petition
25 the court to make a determination on whether the individual lacks capacity.
26 Section 32 of this bill authorizes an individual to make a health care instruction
27 which includes certain preferences regarding the health care of the individual.
28 Section 33 of this bill sets forth the requirements to execute a power of attorney
29 for health care and specifies who may not act as an agent to an individual who lacks
30 capacity.
31 Section 34 of this bill authorizes an individual to create an advance health-care
32 directive that only addresses the mental health care of the individual. Section 35 of
33 this bill sets forth the procedure to follow when an advance health-care directive
34 that addresses only the mental health care of the individual conflicts with any other
35 type of advance health-care directive.
36 Section 36 of this bill sets forth the classes of persons who, in order of priority,
37 may act as a default surrogate for an individual if the individual lacks capacity to
38 make health care decisions and an agent or guardian has not been appointed or the
39 agent or guardian of the individual is not willing or able to act or is not reasonably
40 available. Section 37 of this bill sets forth the procedure a responsible health care
41 professional is required to follow if two or more members of such a class assume
42 authority to act as a default surrogate and the default surrogates disagree on a health
43 care decision.
44 Section 38 of this bill authorizes an individual to disqualify certain persons
45 from acting as a default surrogate.
46 Section 39 of this bill authorizes an individual, under certain circumstances, to
47 revoke: (1) an appointment of an agent; (2) the designation of a default surrogate;
48 or (3) a health care instruction. Section 39 also provides that: (1) a subsequent
49 advance health-care directive revokes a prior advance health-care directive to the
50 extent the two conflict; and (2) the appointment of a spouse or domestic partner is
51 revoked under certain circumstances involving annulment, divorce, dissolution of
52 marriage, legal separation or termination of the domestic partnership.
53 Section 40 of this bill provides that: (1) an advance health-care directive
54 created outside of this State is valid in this State under certain circumstances; (2) a
55 person may rely on an advance health-care directive under certain circumstances;
56 and (3) the directive may not be denied solely because the directive or the signature
57 is in electronic form.
58 Section 41 of this bill provides that an agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary
59 duty to an individual who lacks capacity and is required to make a health care
60 decision in accordance with the direction of the individual in an advance health-
61 care directive.
62 Sections 42 and 43 of this bill set forth the powers and limitations of an agent
63 or a default surrogate under an advance health-care directive or court order.
64 Section 44 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, two or more
65 individuals are authorized to act as co-agents or alternate agents of an individual
66 under an advance health-care directive.
67 Section 45 of this bill sets forth the duties of a health care professional, a
68 responsible health care professional and a health care institution.
69 Section 46 of this bill provides that: (1) a guardian may refuse to comply with
70 or revoke the advance health-care directive of the individual only if the court
71 appointing the guardian expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation; and (2)
-
*AB461_R1*

– 3 –
72 a health care decision made by certain agents prevails over the decision of the
73 guardian appointed for the individual, unless otherwise ordered by a court.
74 Section 47 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, a health care
75 professional, health care institution, an agent or default surrogate acting in good
76 faith is not subject to civil or criminal liability or certain discipline.
77 Section 48 of this bill prohibits a person from taking certain actions concerning
78 an advance health-care directive. Section 48 additionally provides that an
79 individual or the estate of the individual has a cause of action against a person that
80 violates such prohibitions.
81 Section 49 of this bill provides that an electronic copy of an advance health-
82 care directive, a revocation of an advance health-care directive or a designation or
83 disqualification of a surrogate has the same effect as the original. Section 49 also
84 establishes requirements for creating a certified physical copy of an advance health-
85 care directive that is in electronic form.
86 Section 50 of this bill provides that a court acting under this Uniform Act may
87 only grant equitable relief, including, without limitation, a restraining order or
88 injunction: (1) to prevent certain the implementation of a health care decision made
89 by an agent or default surrogate that is inconsistent with the Act; (2) to prevent an
90 agent or default surrogate from making a health care decision for an individual
91 under certain circumstances; or (3) to order implementation of a health care
92 decision.
93 Section 51 of this bill provides that the Uniform Act does not authorize mercy
94 killing, assisted suicide or euthanasia.
95 Section 52 of this bill provides that in applying and construing the Uniform
96 Act, a court is required to consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among
97 jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Act.
98 Sections 1, 53-59.5 and 61-79 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect
99 the changes made in this bill and to remove and replace references to repealed
100 sections.
101 Sections 4-27 of this bill define certain words and terms for the purposes of
102 sections 3-52 and the provisions of existing law that contain only certain provisions
103 of the Uniform Act.
104 Section 60 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services,
105 through the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department, to conduct a
106 program to educate and inform residents of this State concerning planning for long-
107 term care.
108 Section 83 of this bill repeals existing provisions governing the execution of a
109 declaration concerning the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment,
110 thereby making directions concerning such treatment governed solely by the
111 Uniform Act. (NRS 449A.400-449A.481)

2 (b) In a record provided to a responsible health care
3 professional or the health care institution in which the individual
4 resides or is receiving care; or
5 (c) By another act that clearly indicates the individual’s
6 objection.
7 4. If the individual objects under subsection 3, the finding
8 under subsection 2 of section 29 of this act is not sufficient to
9 rebut the presumption of capacity in subsection 1 of section 29 of
10 this act, and the individual must be treated as having capacity,
11 unless:
12 (a) The individual withdraws the objection;
13 (b) A court finds that the individual lacks the presumed
14 capacity;

21 (a) of subsection 2 of section 29 of this act who:
22 (1) Did not make the first finding;
23 (2) Is not a family member of the individual who made the
24 first finding; and
25 (3) Is not the cohabitant of the individual who made the
26 first finding or a descendant of the cohabitant.
27 5. A second finding that the individual lacks capacity under
28 paragraph (d) of subsection 4 is not sufficient to rebut the
29 presumption of capacity if the individual is requesting the
30 provision or continuation of life-sustaining treatment and
31 the finding is being used to make a decision to withhold or
32 withdraw the treatment.
33 6. As soon as reasonably feasible, a health care professional
34 who is informed of an objection under subsection 3 shall:
35 (a) Communicate the objection to a responsible health care
36 professional; and
37 (b) Document the objection and the date of the objection in the
38 individual’s medical record or communicate the objection and the
39 date of the objection to an administrator with responsibility for
40 medical records of the health care institution providing health
41 care to the individual, who shall document the objection and the
42 date of the objection in the individual’s medical record.

44 section 29 of this act to lack capacity, a responsible health care
45 professional, the health care institution providing health care to

6 shall appoint legal counsel to represent the individual if the
7 individual does not have legal counsel in the proceeding. The
8 court shall hear the petition as soon as possible after the petition is
9 filed. As soon as possible, the court shall determine whether the
10 individual lacks capacity. The court may determine that the
11 individual lacks capacity only if the court finds by clear and
12 convincing evidence that the individual lacks capacity.

32 3. A health care instruction made by an individual that
33 conflicts with an earlier health care instruction made by the
34 individual, including, without limitation, an instruction

-
*AB461_R1*

– 15 –
1 2. An appointment of an agent to make decisions only for the
2 mental health care of the individual does not revoke an earlier
3 appointment of an agent to make any other health care decisions
4 for the individual. A later appointment revokes the authority of an
5 agent under the earlier appointment to make decisions about
6 mental health care unless otherwise specified in the power of
7 attorney making the later appointment.
8 3. Appointment of an agent to make health care decisions for
9 an individual other than decisions about mental health care made

24 surrogate for the individual:
25 (a) An adult whom the individual has identified, other than in
26 a power of attorney for health care, to make a health care decision
27 for the individual if the individual cannot make the decision;
28 (b) The spouse or domestic partner of the individual, unless:
29 (1) A petition for annulment, divorce, dissolution of

9 individual who assumes authority to act as a default surrogate to
10 provide a declaration in a record under penalty of perjury stating
11 facts and circumstances reasonably sufficient to establish the
12 authority.
13 4. If a responsible health care professional reasonably
14 determines that an individual who has assumed authority to act as
15 a default surrogate is not willing or able to comply with a duty
16 under section 41 of this act or fails to do so in a timely manner,
17 the professional may recognize the individual next in priority
18 under subsection 2 as the default surrogate.
19 5. A health care decision made by a default surrogate is
20 effective without judicial approval.
21 Sec. 37. 1. A default surrogate who assumes authority
22 under section 36 of this act shall inform a responsible health care
23 professional if two or more members of a class under subsection 2

38 but have not yet communicated their views to the professional. The
39 professional, after the solicitation, shall comply with the decision
40 of a majority of the members who have communicated their views

4 would be made may disqualify another individual from acting as a
5 default surrogate for the first individual. The disqualification may
6 be in a record signed by the first individual or communicated
7 verbally or nonverbally to the individual being disqualified,
8 another individual or a responsible health care professional.
9 Disqualification under this subsection is effective even if made by
10 an individual who lacks capacity to make an advance health-care

20 surrogate;
21 (b) The potential default surrogate is an owner, operator,
22 employee or contractor of a nursing home in which the individual

25 of the individual or a descendant of the cohabitant; or
26 (c) The potential default surrogate refuses to provide a timely
27 declaration under subsection 3 of section 36 of this act.

35 subsection 4 of section 30 of this act; or
36 (c) The individual created an advance mental health-care
37 directive that includes the provision under subsection 4 of section
38 34 of this act and the individual is experiencing the psychiatric or
39 psychological event specified in the directive.
40 2. Revocation under subsection 1 may be by any act of the
41 individual that clearly indicates that the individual intends to
42 revoke the appointment, designation or instruction, including,

20 is specified, the state in which the individual created the directive;

24 of this act.
25 2. A person may assume without inquiry that an advance

28 believe that the directive is invalid or has been revoked.

30 or a signature on a directive or revocation may not be denied legal
31 effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.
32 4. Evidence relating to an advance health-care directive,

37 162A.736, 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive,

12 reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate.
13 3. If there is not a direction in an advance health-care
14 directive and the goals, preferences and wishes of the individual
15 regarding a health care decision are not known or reasonably
16 ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate, the agent or
17 default surrogate shall make the decision in accordance with the
18 agent’s or default surrogate’s determination of the individual’s

41 (b) The individual objects to the placement; and
42 (c) The individual is not terminally ill.

28 predecessor agent resigns, dies, becomes disqualified, is not
29 reasonably available or is otherwise unwilling or unable to act as
30 agent.
31 3. Unless the power of attorney provides otherwise, an
32 alternate agent has the same authority as the original agent:

14 PROVIDER. THE PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER
15 SHALL NOTE THE REVOCATION IN YOUR MEDICAL
16 RECORD. TO BE VALID, THIS ADVANCE DIRECTIVE
17 MUST BE SIGNED BY TWO QUALIFIED WITNESSES,
18 PERSONALLY KNOWN TO YOU, WHO ARE PRESENT

23 NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER
24 PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
25
26 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance
27 directive to provide consent or refuse to consent to future
28 psychiatric care if the person later becomes incapable of
29 making or communicating those decisions. By executing a
30 durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
31 [162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive,] 162A.710, 162A.715,
32 162A.733, 162A.736, 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3
33 to 52, inclusive, of this act, the person may also appoint an
34 agent to make decisions regarding psychiatric care for the
35 person when incapable. A person is “incapable” for the
36 purposes of this advance directive when in the opinion of two
37 providers of health care, one of whom must be a physician or
38 licensed psychologist and the other of whom must be a
39 physician, a physician assistant, a licensed psychologist, a
40 psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who has
41 the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State
42 Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person
43 currently lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make
44 or communicate decisions regarding psychiatric care. If a
45 person is determined to be incapable, the person may be
-
*AB461_R1*

– 44 –
1 found capable when, in the opinion of the person’s attending
2 physician or an advanced practice registered nurse who has
3 the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State
4 Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120 and has an
5 established relationship with the person, the person has
6 regained sufficient understanding or capacity to make or
7 communicate decisions regarding psychiatric care. This
8 document becomes effective upon its proper execution and
9 remains valid for a period of 2 years after the date of its
10 execution unless revoked. Upon being presented with this
11 advance directive, the physician or other provider of health
12 care must make it a part of the person’s medical record. The
13 physician or other provider must act in accordance with the
14 statements expressed in the advance directive when the
15 person is determined to be incapable, except as otherwise
16 provided in NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider
17 shall promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the
18 agent of the principal, and document in the principal’s
19 medical record any act or omission that is not in compliance
20 with any part of an advance directive. A physician or other
21 provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed,
22 dated and notarized advance directive.

32 assistant, a licensed psychologist, a psychiatrist or an
33 advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric
34 training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
35 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive
36 and evaluate information effectively or communicate
37 decisions is impaired to such an extent that I lack the capacity
38 to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I understand that
39 psychiatric care may not be administered without my express
40 and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my
41 informed consent, the express and informed consent of my
42 legally responsible person, my agent named pursuant to a
43 valid durable power of attorney for health care or my consent
