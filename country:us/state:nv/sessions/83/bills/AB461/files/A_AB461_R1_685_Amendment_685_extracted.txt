AN ACT relating to powers of attorney; [enacting the provisions of the Uniform
Health-Care Decisions Act that have not been enacted into law in this
State; revising various provisions relating to powers of attorney for
health care to conform with the Uniform Act;] requiring the
Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Aging
and Disability Services Division of the Department, to conduct a
program to educate and inform residents of this State concerning
planning for long-term care; requesting the Guardianship
Commission created by the Nevada Supreme Court to study and
make recommendations relating to the Uniform Health-Care
Decisions Act; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for health care
2 decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person may create an advance
3 health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power of attorney for health care, by
4 using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. (NRS 162A.715, 162A.855)
5 Existing law also contains definitions from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of
6 “guardian,” “health care” and “nursing home.” This bill replaces other provisions of existing
7 law relating to powers of attorney for health care with the remaining provisions of the
8 Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act that have been enacted into law.
9 Section 28 of this bill provides that an individual has capacity to make health care
10 decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive if the individual: (1) is willing
11 and able to communicate a decision independently or with appropriate services, technological
12 assistance, supported decision making or other reasonable accommodations; and (2)
13 understands the nature and consequences of the action, including, with limitation, the risks
14 and benefits of the action, or, if the individual is appointing an agent to make health care
15 decisions for the individual, the individual recognizes the identity of the individual being
16 appointed and understands the general nature of the relationship with the individual being
17 appointed. Under section 29 of this bill, an individual is presumed to have capacity to make
18 health care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive, unless certain
19 health care professionals or a court determine that the individual does not have such capacity.
20 Sections 30 and 31 of this bill require certain notice of a finding that an individual lacks
21 capacity, authorize an individual to object to the finding that the individual lacks capacity and
Senate Amendment No. 685 to Assembly Bill No. 461 First Reprint Page 4
22 authorize certain persons to petition the court to make a determination on whether the
23 individual lacks capacity.
24 Section 32 of this bill authorizes an individual to make a health care instruction which
25 includes certain preferences regarding the health care of the individual.
26 Section 33 of this bill sets forth the requirements to execute a power of attorney for health
27 care and specifies who may not act as an agent to an individual who lacks capacity.
28 Section 34 of this bill authorizes an individual to create an advance health-care directive
29 that only addresses the mental health care of the individual. Section 35 of this bill sets forth
30 the procedure to follow when an advance health-care directive that addresses only the mental
31 health care of the individual conflicts with any other type of advance health-care directive.
32 Section 36 of this bill sets forth the classes of persons who, in order of priority, may act
33 as a default surrogate for an individual if the individual lacks capacity to make health care
34 decisions and an agent or guardian has not been appointed or the agent or guardian of the
35 individual is not willing or able to act or is not reasonably available. Section 37 of this bill sets
36 forth the procedure a responsible health care professional is required to follow if two or more
37 members of such a class assume authority to act as a default surrogate and the default
38 surrogates disagree on a health care decision.
39 Section 38 of this bill authorizes an individual to disqualify certain persons from acting as
40 a default surrogate.
41 Section 39 of this bill authorizes an individual, under certain circumstances, to revoke: (1)
42 an appointment of an agent; (2) the designation of a default surrogate; or (3) a health care
43 instruction. Section 39 also provides that: (1) a subsequent advance health-care directive
44 revokes a prior advance health-care directive to the extent the two conflict; and (2) the
45 appointment of a spouse or domestic partner is revoked under certain circumstances involving
46 annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or termination of the domestic
47 partnership.
48 Section 40 of this bill provides that: (1) an advance health-care directive created outside
49 of this State is valid in this State under certain circumstances; (2) a person may rely on an
50 advance health-care directive under certain circumstances; and (3) the directive may not be
51 denied solely because the directive or the signature is in electronic form.
52 Section 41 of this bill provides that an agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary duty to
53 an individual who lacks capacity and is required to make a health care decision in accordance
54 with the direction of the individual in an advance health-care directive.
55 Sections 42 and 43 of this bill set forth the powers and limitations of an agent or a default
56 surrogate under an advance health-care directive or court order.
57 Section 44 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, two or more individuals
58 are authorized to act as co-agents or alternate agents of an individual under an advance health-
59 care directive.
60 Section 45 of this bill sets forth the duties of a health care professional, a responsible
61 health care professional and a health care institution.
62 Section 46 of this bill provides that: (1) a guardian may refuse to comply with or revoke
63 the advance health-care directive of the individual only if the court appointing the guardian
64 expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation; and (2) a health care decision made by
65 certain agents prevails over the decision of the guardian appointed for the individual, unless
66 otherwise ordered by a court.
67 Section 47 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, a health care
68 professional, health care institution, an agent or default surrogate acting in good faith is not
69 subject to civil or criminal liability or certain discipline.
70 Section 48 of this bill prohibits a person from taking certain actions concerning an
71 advance health-care directive. Section 48 additionally provides that an individual or the estate
72 of the individual has a cause of action against a person that violates such prohibitions.
73 Section 49 of this bill provides that an electronic copy of an advance health-care
74 directive, a revocation of an advance health-care directive or a designation or disqualification
75 of a surrogate has the same effect as the original. Section 49 also establishes requirements for
76 creating a certified physical copy of an advance health-care directive that is in electronic form.
77 Section 50 of this bill provides that a court acting under this Uniform Act may only grant
78 equitable relief, including, without limitation, a restraining order or injunction: (1) to prevent
79 certain the implementation of a health care decision made by an agent or default surrogate that
80 is inconsistent with the Act; (2) to prevent an agent or default surrogate from making a health
Senate Amendment No. 685 to Assembly Bill No. 461 First Reprint Page 5
81 care decision for an individual under certain circumstances; or (3) to order implementation of
82 a health care decision.
83 Section 51 of this bill provides that the Uniform Act does not authorize mercy killing,
84 assisted suicide or euthanasia.
85 Section 52 of this bill provides that in applying and construing the Uniform Act, a court is
86 required to consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact the
87 Uniform Act.
88 Sections 1, 53-59.5 and 61-79 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the changes
89 made in this bill and to remove and replace references to repealed sections.
90 Sections 4-27 of this bill define certain words and terms for the purposes of sections 3-52
91 and the provisions of existing law that contain only certain provisions of the Uniform Act.]
92 Existing law requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department
93 of Health and Human Services to provide certain services to aging persons and persons
94 with disabilities (Chapters 427A and 435 of NRS) Section 60 of this bill requires the
95 Department , [of Health and Human Services,] through the [Aging and Disability Services]
96 Division , [of the Department,] to conduct a program to educate and inform residents of this
97 State concerning planning for long-term care.
98 [Section 83 of this bill repeals existing provisions governing the execution of a
99 declaration concerning the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, thereby
100 making directions concerning such treatment governed solely by the Uniform Act. (NRS
101 449A.400-449A.481)]
102 Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for health
103 care decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person may create an
104 advance health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power of attorney for
105 health care, by using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. (NRS
106 162A.715, 162A.855) Existing law also contains definitions from the Uniform Health-
107 Care Decisions Act of “guardian,” “health care” and “nursing home.” Section 80.5 of
108 this bill requests that the Guardianship Commission created by the Nevada Supreme
109 Court: (1) examine the remaining provisions of the Uniform Act and the implementation
110 of the Act in other jurisdictions; and (2) make recommendations to the Joint Interim
111 Standing Committee on Health and Human Services concerning the potential enactment
112 of the Uniform Act in this State.

26 NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
27
28 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance directive to provide
29 consent or refuse to consent to future psychiatric care if the person later
30 becomes incapable of making or communicating those decisions. By
31 executing a durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
32 [162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive,] 162A.710, 162A.715, 162A.733,
33 162A.736, 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive, of this
34 act, the person may also appoint an agent to make decisions regarding
35 psychiatric care for the person when incapable. A person is “incapable” for
36 the purposes of this advance directive when in the opinion of two providers
37 of health care, one of whom must be a physician or licensed psychologist
38 and the other of whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed
39 psychologist, a psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who
40 has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
41 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person currently lacks sufficient
42 understanding or capacity to make or communicate decisions regarding
43 psychiatric care. If a person is determined to be incapable, the person may
44 be found capable when, in the opinion of the person’s attending physician
45 or an advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric training
46 and experience prescribed by the State Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS
47 632.120 and has an established relationship with the person, the person has
48 regained sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate
49 decisions regarding psychiatric care. This document becomes effective
50 upon its proper execution and remains valid for a period of 2 years after the
51 date of its execution unless revoked. Upon being presented with this
52 advance directive, the physician or other provider of health care must make
53 it a part of the person’s medical record. The physician or other provider
Senate Amendment No. 685 to Assembly Bill No. 461 First Reprint Page 35
1 must act in accordance with the statements expressed in the advance
2 directive when the person is determined to be incapable, except as
3 otherwise provided in NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider shall
4 promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the agent of the principal,
5 and document in the principal’s medical record any act or omission that is
6 not in compliance with any part of an advance directive. A physician or
7 other provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated
8 and notarized advance directive.

18 has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
19 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive and evaluate
20 information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an
21 extent that I lack the capacity to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I
22 understand that psychiatric care may not be administered without my
23 express and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my informed

26 health care or my consent expressed in this advance directive for
27 psychiatric care. I understand that I may become incapable of giving or

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to powers of attorney; [enacting the provisions of the Uniform
Health-Care Decisions Act that have not been enacted into law in this
State; revising various provisions relating to powers of attorney for
health care to conform with the Uniform Act;] requiring the
Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Aging
and Disability Services Division of the Department, to conduct a
program to educate and inform residents of this State concerning
planning for long-term care; requesting the Guardianship
Commission created by the Nevada Supreme Court to study and
make recommendations relating to the Uniform Health-Care
Decisions Act; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for health care
2 decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person may create an advance
3 health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power of attorney for health care, by
4 using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. (NRS 162A.715, 162A.855)
5 Existing law also contains definitions from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of
6 “guardian,” “health care” and “nursing home.” This bill replaces other provisions of existing
7 law relating to powers of attorney for health care with the remaining provisions of the
8 Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act that have been enacted into law.
9 Section 28 of this bill provides that an individual has capacity to make health care
10 decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive if the individual: (1) is willing
11 and able to communicate a decision independently or with appropriate services, technological
12 assistance, supported decision making or other reasonable accommodations; and (2)
13 understands the nature and consequences of the action, including, with limitation, the risks
14 and benefits of the action, or, if the individual is appointing an agent to make health care
15 decisions for the individual, the individual recognizes the identity of the individual being
16 appointed and understands the general nature of the relationship with the individual being
17 appointed. Under section 29 of this bill, an individual is presumed to have capacity to make
18 health care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive, unless certain
19 health care professionals or a court determine that the individual does not have such capacity.
20 Sections 30 and 31 of this bill require certain notice of a finding that an individual lacks
21 capacity, authorize an individual to object to the finding that the individual lacks capacity and

Senate Amendment No. 685 to Assembly Bill No. 461 First Reprint Page 4
22 authorize certain persons to petition the court to make a determination on whether the
23 individual lacks capacity.
24 Section 32 of this bill authorizes an individual to make a health care instruction which
25 includes certain preferences regarding the health care of the individual.
26 Section 33 of this bill sets forth the requirements to execute a power of attorney for health
27 care and specifies who may not act as an agent to an individual who lacks capacity.
28 Section 34 of this bill authorizes an individual to create an advance health-care directive
29 that only addresses the mental health care of the individual. Section 35 of this bill sets forth
30 the procedure to follow when an advance health-care directive that addresses only the mental
31 health care of the individual conflicts with any other type of advance health-care directive.
32 Section 36 of this bill sets forth the classes of persons who, in order of priority, may act
33 as a default surrogate for an individual if the individual lacks capacity to make health care
34 decisions and an agent or guardian has not been appointed or the agent or guardian of the
35 individual is not willing or able to act or is not reasonably available. Section 37 of this bill sets
36 forth the procedure a responsible health care professional is required to follow if two or more
37 members of such a class assume authority to act as a default surrogate and the default
38 surrogates disagree on a health care decision.
39 Section 38 of this bill authorizes an individual to disqualify certain persons from acting as
40 a default surrogate.
41 Section 39 of this bill authorizes an individual, under certain circumstances, to revoke: (1)
42 an appointment of an agent; (2) the designation of a default surrogate; or (3) a health care
43 instruction. Section 39 also provides that: (1) a subsequent advance health-care directive
44 revokes a prior advance health-care directive to the extent the two conflict; and (2) the
45 appointment of a spouse or domestic partner is revoked under certain circumstances involving
46 annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or termination of the domestic
47 partnership.
48 Section 40 of this bill provides that: (1) an advance health-care directive created outside
49 of this State is valid in this State under certain circumstances; (2) a person may rely on an
50 advance health-care directive under certain circumstances; and (3) the directive may not be
51 denied solely because the directive or the signature is in electronic form.
52 Section 41 of this bill provides that an agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary duty to
53 an individual who lacks capacity and is required to make a health care decision in accordance
54 with the direction of the individual in an advance health-care directive.
55 Sections 42 and 43 of this bill set forth the powers and limitations of an agent or a default
56 surrogate under an advance health-care directive or court order.
57 Section 44 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, two or more individuals
58 are authorized to act as co-agents or alternate agents of an individual under an advance health-
59 care directive.
60 Section 45 of this bill sets forth the duties of a health care professional, a responsible
61 health care professional and a health care institution.
62 Section 46 of this bill provides that: (1) a guardian may refuse to comply with or revoke
63 the advance health-care directive of the individual only if the court appointing the guardian
64 expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation; and (2) a health care decision made by
65 certain agents prevails over the decision of the guardian appointed for the individual, unless
66 otherwise ordered by a court.
67 Section 47 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, a health care
68 professional, health care institution, an agent or default surrogate acting in good faith is not
69 subject to civil or criminal liability or certain discipline.
70 Section 48 of this bill prohibits a person from taking certain actions concerning an
71 advance health-care directive. Section 48 additionally provides that an individual or the estate
72 of the individual has a cause of action against a person that violates such prohibitions.
73 Section 49 of this bill provides that an electronic copy of an advance health-care
74 directive, a revocation of an advance health-care directive or a designation or disqualification
75 of a surrogate has the same effect as the original. Section 49 also establishes requirements for
76 creating a certified physical copy of an advance health-care directive that is in electronic form.
77 Section 50 of this bill provides that a court acting under this Uniform Act may only grant
78 equitable relief, including, without limitation, a restraining order or injunction: (1) to prevent
79 certain the implementation of a health care decision made by an agent or default surrogate that
80 is inconsistent with the Act; (2) to prevent an agent or default surrogate from making a health

Senate Amendment No. 685 to Assembly Bill No. 461 First Reprint Page 5
81 care decision for an individual under certain circumstances; or (3) to order implementation of
82 a health care decision.
83 Section 51 of this bill provides that the Uniform Act does not authorize mercy killing,
84 assisted suicide or euthanasia.
85 Section 52 of this bill provides that in applying and construing the Uniform Act, a court is
86 required to consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact the
87 Uniform Act.
88 Sections 1, 53-59.5 and 61-79 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the changes
89 made in this bill and to remove and replace references to repealed sections.
90 Sections 4-27 of this bill define certain words and terms for the purposes of sections 3-52
91 and the provisions of existing law that contain only certain provisions of the Uniform Act.]
92 Existing law requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department
93 of Health and Human Services to provide certain services to aging persons and persons
94 with disabilities (Chapters 427A and 435 of NRS) Section 60 of this bill requires the
95 Department , [of Health and Human Services,] through the [Aging and Disability Services]
96 Division , [of the Department,] to conduct a program to educate and inform residents of this
97 State concerning planning for long-term care.
98 [Section 83 of this bill repeals existing provisions governing the execution of a
99 declaration concerning the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, thereby
100 making directions concerning such treatment governed solely by the Uniform Act. (NRS
101 449A.400-449A.481)]
102 Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for health
103 care decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person may create an
104 advance health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power of attorney for
105 health care, by using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. (NRS
106 162A.715, 162A.855) Existing law also contains definitions from the Uniform Health-
107 Care Decisions Act of “guardian,” “health care” and “nursing home.” Section 80.5 of
108 this bill requests that the Guardianship Commission created by the Nevada Supreme
109 Court: (1) examine the remaining provisions of the Uniform Act and the implementation
110 of the Act in other jurisdictions; and (2) make recommendations to the Joint Interim
111 Standing Committee on Health and Human Services concerning the potential enactment
112 of the Uniform Act in this State.

26 NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
27
28 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance directive to provide
29 consent or refuse to consent to future psychiatric care if the person later
30 becomes incapable of making or communicating those decisions. By
31 executing a durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
32 [162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive,] 162A.710, 162A.715, 162A.733,
33 162A.736, 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive, of this
34 act, the person may also appoint an agent to make decisions regarding
35 psychiatric care for the person when incapable. A person is “incapable” for
36 the purposes of this advance directive when in the opinion of two providers
37 of health care, one of whom must be a physician or licensed psychologist
38 and the other of whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed
39 psychologist, a psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who
40 has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
41 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person currently lacks sufficient
42 understanding or capacity to make or communicate decisions regarding
43 psychiatric care. If a person is determined to be incapable, the person may
44 be found capable when, in the opinion of the person’s attending physician
45 or an advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric training
46 and experience prescribed by the State Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS
47 632.120 and has an established relationship with the person, the person has
48 regained sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate
49 decisions regarding psychiatric care. This document becomes effective
50 upon its proper execution and remains valid for a period of 2 years after the
51 date of its execution unless revoked. Upon being presented with this
52 advance directive, the physician or other provider of health care must make
53 it a part of the person’s medical record. The physician or other provider

Senate Amendment No. 685 to Assembly Bill No. 461 First Reprint Page 35
1 must act in accordance with the statements expressed in the advance
2 directive when the person is determined to be incapable, except as
3 otherwise provided in NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider shall
4 promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the agent of the principal,
5 and document in the principal’s medical record any act or omission that is
6 not in compliance with any part of an advance directive. A physician or
7 other provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated
8 and notarized advance directive.

17 psychologist, a psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who
18 has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
19 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive and evaluate
20 information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an
21 extent that I lack the capacity to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I
22 understand that psychiatric care may not be administered without my
23 express and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my informed
24 consent, the express and informed consent of my legally responsible
25 person, my agent named pursuant to a valid durable power of attorney for
26 health care or my consent expressed in this advance directive for
27 psychiatric care. I understand that I may become incapable of giving or
28 withholding informed consent or refusal for psychiatric care due to the
29 symptoms of a diagnosed mental disorder. These symptoms may include:
