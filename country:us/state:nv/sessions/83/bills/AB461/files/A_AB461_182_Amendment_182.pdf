AN ACT relating to powers of attorney; enacting the provisions of the Uniform
Health-Care Decisions Act that have not been enacted into law in this
State; revising various provisions relating to powers of attorney for
health care to conform with the Uniform Act; requiring the Department
of Health and Human Services, acting through the Aging and
Disability Services Division of the Department, to conduct a program
to educate and inform residents of this State concerning planning for
long-term care; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for health care
2 decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person may create an advance
3 health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power of attorney for health care, by
4 using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act. (NRS 162A.715, 162A.855)
5 Existing law also contains definitions from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of
6 “guardian,” “health care” and “nursing home.” This bill replaces other provisions of existing
7 law relating to powers of attorney for health care with the remaining provisions of the
8 Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act that have been enacted into law.
9 Section 28 of this bill provides that an individual has capacity to make health care
10 decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive if the individual: (1) is willing
11 and able to communicate a decision independently or with appropriate services, technological
12 assistance, supported decision making or other reasonable accommodations; and (2)
13 understands the nature and consequences of the action, including, with limitation, the risks
14 and benefits of the action, or, if the individual is appointing an agent to make health care
15 decisions for the individual, the individual recognizes the identity of the individual being
16 appointed and understands the general nature of the relationship with the individual being
17 appointed. Under section 29 of this bill, an individual is presumed to have capacity to make
18 health care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive, unless certain
19 health care professionals or a court determine that the individual does not have such capacity.
20 Sections 30 and 31 of this bill require certain notice of a finding that an individual lacks
21 capacity, authorize an individual to object to the finding that the individual lacks capacity and
22 authorize certain persons to petition the court to make a determination on whether the
23 individual lacks capacity.
24 Section 32 of this bill authorizes an individual to make a health care instruction which
25 includes certain preferences regarding the health care of the individual.

Assembly Amendment No. 182 to Assembly Bill No. 461 Page 4
26 Section 33 of this bill sets forth the requirements to execute a power of attorney for
27 health care and specifies who may not act as an agent to an individual who lacks capacity.
28 Section 34 of this bill authorizes an individual to create an advance health-care directive
29 that only addresses the mental health care of the individual. Section 35 of this bill sets forth
30 the procedure to follow when an advance health-care directive that addresses only the mental
31 health care of the individual conflicts with any other type of advance health-care directive.
32 Section 36 of this bill sets forth the classes of persons who, in order of priority, may act
33 as a default surrogate for an individual if the individual lacks capacity to make health care
34 decisions and an agent or guardian has not been appointed or the agent or guardian of the
35 individual is not willing or able to act or is not reasonably available. Section 37 of this bill
36 sets forth the procedure a responsible health care professional is required to follow if two or
37 more members of such a class assume authority to act as a default surrogate and the default
38 surrogates disagree on a health care decision.
39 Section 38 of this bill authorizes an individual to disqualify certain persons from acting
40 as a default surrogate.
41 Section 39 of this bill authorizes an individual, under certain circumstances, to revoke:
42 (1) an appointment of an agent; (2) the designation of a default surrogate; or (3) a health care
43 instruction. Section 39 also provides that: (1) a subsequent advance health-care directive
44 revokes a prior advance health-care directive to the extent the two conflict; and (2) the
45 appointment of a spouse or domestic partner is revoked under certain circumstances involving
46 annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or termination of the domestic
47 partnership.
48 Section 40 of this bill provides that: (1) an advance health-care directive created outside
49 of this State is valid in this State under certain circumstances; (2) a person may rely on an
50 advance health-care directive under certain circumstances; and (3) the directive may not be
51 denied solely because the directive or the signature is in electronic form.
52 Section 41 of this bill provides that an agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary duty to
53 an individual who lacks capacity and is required to make a health care decision in accordance
54 with the direction of the individual in an advance health-care directive.
55 Sections 42 and 43 of this bill set forth the powers and limitations of an agent or a
56 default surrogate under an advance health-care directive or court order.
57 Section 44 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, two or more individuals
58 are authorized to act as co-agents or alternate agents of an individual under an advance health-
59 care directive.
60 Section 45 of this bill sets forth the duties of a health care professional, a responsible
61 health care professional and a health care institution.
62 Section 46 of this bill provides that: (1) a guardian may refuse to comply with or revoke
63 the advance health-care directive of the individual only if the court appointing the guardian
64 expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation; and (2) a health care decision made by
65 certain agents prevails over the decision of the guardian appointed for the individual, unless
66 otherwise ordered by a court.
67 Section 47 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, a health care
68 professional, health care institution, an agent or default surrogate acting in good faith is not
69 subject to civil or criminal liability or certain discipline.
70 Section 48 of this bill prohibits a person from taking certain actions concerning an
71 advance health-care directive. Section 48 additionally provides that an individual or the estate
72 of the individual has a cause of action against a person that violates such prohibitions.
73 Section 49 of this bill provides that an electronic copy of an advance health-care
74 directive, a revocation of an advance health-care directive or a designation or disqualification
75 of a surrogate has the same effect as the original. Section 49 also establishes requirements for
76 creating a certified physical copy of an advance health-care directive that is in electronic form.
77 Section 50 of this bill provides that a court acting under this Uniform Act may only grant
78 equitable relief, including, without limitation, a restraining order or injunction: (1) to prevent
79 certain the implementation of a health care decision made by an agent or default surrogate that
80 is inconsistent with the Act; (2) to prevent an agent or default surrogate from making a health
81 care decision for an individual under certain circumstances; or (3) to order implementation of
82 a health care decision.
83 Section 51 of this bill provides that the Uniform Act does not authorize mercy killing,
84 assisted suicide or euthanasia.

Assembly Amendment No. 182 to Assembly Bill No. 461 Page 5
85 Section 52 of this bill provides that in applying and construing the Uniform Act, a court
86 is required to consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact
87 the Uniform Act.
88 Sections 1, [53-59] 53-59.5 and 61-79 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
89 changes made in this bill and to remove and replace references to repealed sections.
90 Sections 4-27 of this bill define certain words and terms for the purposes of sections 3-52
91 and the provisions of existing law that contain only certain provisions of the Uniform Act.
92 Section 60 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services, through
93 the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department, to conduct a program to
94 educate and inform residents of this State concerning planning for long-term care.
95 Section 83 of this bill repeals existing provisions governing the execution of a
96 declaration concerning the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment,
97 thereby making directions concerning such treatment governed solely by the Uniform
98 Act. (NRS 449A.400-449A.481)

36 (1) A physician;
37 (2) A licensed psychologist;

47 treatment to be made promptly to avoid loss of life or serious harm to the health
48 of the individual; and
49 (II) An individual listed in subparagraph (1), (2), or (3) is not

13 rebutted under subsection 2.
14 Sec. 30. 1. As soon as reasonably feasible, an individual who makes a
15 finding under subsection 2 of section 29 of this act shall inform the individual
16 about whom the finding was made or the individual’s responsible health care
17 professional of the finding.

26 health care institution in which the individual resides or is receiving care; or
27 (c) By another act that clearly indicates the individual’s objection.
28 4. If the individual objects under subsection 3, the finding under subsection
29 2 of section 29 of this act is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of capacity in
30 subsection 1 of section 29 of this act, and the individual must be treated as having
31 capacity, unless:
32 (a) The individual withdraws the objection;
33 (b) A court finds that the individual lacks the presumed capacity;
34 (c) The individual is experiencing a health condition requiring that a
35 decision regarding health care treatment be made promptly to avoid imminent

42 and
43 (3) Is not the cohabitant of the individual who made the first finding or a
44 descendant of the cohabitant.
45 5. A second finding that the individual lacks capacity under paragraph (d)
46 of subsection 4 is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of capacity if the
47 individual is requesting the provision or continuation of life-sustaining treatment
48 and the finding is being used to make a decision to withhold or withdraw the
49 treatment.
50 6. As soon as reasonably feasible, a health care professional who is
51 informed of an objection under subsection 3 shall:
52 (a) Communicate the objection to a responsible health care professional; and

3 administrator with responsibility for medical records of the health care institution
4 providing health care to the individual, who shall document the objection and the
5 date of the objection in the individual’s medical record.
6 Sec. 31. 1. An individual found under subsection 2 of section 29 of this
7 act to lack capacity, a responsible health care professional, the health care
8 institution providing health care to the individual or a person interested in the
9 welfare of the individual may petition a district court in the county in which the
10 individual resides or is located to determine whether the individual lacks capacity.
11 2. The court in which a petition under subsection 1 is filed shall appoint
12 legal counsel to represent the individual if the individual does not have legal
13 counsel in the proceeding. The court shall hear the petition as soon as possible
14 after the petition is filed. As soon as possible, the court shall determine whether
15 the individual lacks capacity. The court may determine that the individual lacks

29 the date of the instruction in the individual’s medical record or communicate the
30 instruction and date of the instruction to an administrator with responsibility for
31 medical records of the health care institution providing health care to the
32 individual, who shall document the instruction and the date of the instruction in
33 the individual’s medical record.
34 3. A health care instruction made by an individual that conflicts with an
35 earlier health care instruction made by the individual, including, without
36 limitation, an instruction documented in a medical order, revokes the earlier
37 instruction to the extent of the conflict.
38 4. A health care instruction may be in the same record as a power of
39 attorney for health care.
40 Sec. 33. 1. An individual may create a power of attorney for health care
41 to appoint an agent to make a health care decision for the individual.
42 2. An individual is disqualified from acting as agent for an individual who

10 individual conflicts with a direction in another advance health-care directive of
11 the individual, the later direction revokes the earlier direction to the extent of the
12 conflict.
13 2. An appointment of an agent to make decisions only for the mental health
14 care of the individual does not revoke an earlier appointment of an agent to make
15 any other health care decisions for the individual. A later appointment revokes
16 the authority of an agent under the earlier appointment to make decisions about
17 mental health care unless otherwise specified in the power of attorney making the
18 later appointment.
19 3. Appointment of an agent to make health care decisions for an individual
20 other than decisions about mental health care made after appointment of an
21 agent authorized to make only mental health care decisions does not revoke the
22 appointment of the agent authorized to make only mental health care decisions.
23 Sec. 36. 1. A default surrogate may make a health care decision for an
24 individual who lacks capacity to make health care decisions and for whom [an] :

33 (a) An adult whom the individual has identified, other than in a power of
34 attorney for health care, to make a health care decision for the individual if the
35 individual cannot make the decision;
36 (b) The spouse or domestic partner of the individual, unless:
37 (1) A petition for annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
38 separation or termination has been filed and not dismissed or withdrawn;
39 (2) A decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
40 separation or termination has been issued;

4 (i) An adult not listed in paragraphs (a) to (h), inclusive, who has exhibited
5 special care and concern for the individual and is familiar with the personal
6 values of the individual.
7 3. A responsible health care professional may require an individual who
8 assumes authority to act as a default surrogate to provide a declaration in a
9 record under penalty of perjury stating facts and circumstances reasonably
10 sufficient to establish the authority.
11 4. If a responsible health care professional reasonably determines that an
12 individual who has assumed authority to act as a default surrogate is not willing
13 or able to comply with a duty under section 41 of this act or fails to do so in a
14 timely manner, the professional may recognize the individual next in priority
15 under subsection 2 as the default surrogate.
16 5. A health care decision made by a default surrogate is effective without
17 judicial approval.
18 Sec. 37. 1. A default surrogate who assumes authority under section 36 of
19 this act shall inform a responsible health care professional if two or more
20 members of a class under subsection 2 of section 36 of this act have assumed
21 authority to act as default surrogates and the members do not agree on a health
22 care decision.
23 2. A responsible health care professional shall comply with the decision of a
24 majority of the members of the class with highest priority under subsection 2 of
25 section 36 of this act who have communicated their views to the professional and
26 the professional reasonably believes are acting consistent with their duties under
27 section 41 of this act.
28 3. If a responsible health care professional is informed that the members of
29 the class who have communicated their views to the professional are evenly
30 divided concerning the health care decision, the professional shall make a
31 reasonable effort to solicit the views of members of the class who are reasonably
32 available but have not yet communicated their views to the professional. The
33 professional, after the solicitation, shall comply with the decision of a majority of
34 the members who have communicated their views to the professional and the
35 professional reasonably believes are acting consistent with their duties under
36 section 41 of this act.
37 4. If the class remains evenly divided after the effort is made under
38 subsection 3, the health care decision must be made as provided by other law of
39 this State regarding the treatment of an individual who is found to lack capacity.
40 Sec. 38. 1. An individual for whom health care decisions would be made
41 may disqualify another individual from acting as a default surrogate for the first
42 individual. The disqualification may be in a record signed by the first individual
43 or communicated verbally or nonverbally to the individual being disqualified,
44 another individual or a responsible health care professional. Disqualification
45 under this subsection is effective even if made by an individual who lacks
46 capacity to make an advance health-care directive if the individual clearly
47 communicates a desire that the individual being disqualified not make health
48 care decisions for the individual.
49 2. An individual is disqualified from acting as a default surrogate for an
50 individual who lacks capacity to make health care decisions if:
51 (a) A court finds that the potential default surrogate poses a danger to the
52 individual’s well-being, even if the court does not issue a protective order or
53 restraining order against the potential surrogate;

Assembly Amendment No. 182 to Assembly Bill No. 461 Page 15
1 (b) The potential default surrogate is an owner, operator, employee or
2 contractor of a nursing home in which the individual is residing or receiving care
3 unless the owner, operator, employee or contractor is a family member of the
4 individual, the cohabitant of the individual or a descendant of the cohabitant; or
5 (c) The potential default surrogate refuses to provide a timely declaration
6 under subsection 3 of section 36 of this act.
7 Sec. 39. 1. An individual may revoke the appointment of an agent, the
8 designation of a default surrogate or a health care instruction in whole or in part,
9 unless:
10 (a) A court finds that the individual lacks capacity to do so;
11 (b) The individual is found under subsection 2 of section 29 of this act to
12 lack capacity to do so and, if the individual objects to the finding, the finding is
13 confirmed under paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of section 30 of this act; or
14 (c) The individual created an advance mental health-care directive that
15 includes the provision under subsection 4 of section 34 of this act and the
16 individual is experiencing the psychiatric or psychological event specified in the
17 directive.
18 2. Revocation under subsection 1 may be by any act of the individual that
19 clearly indicates that the individual intends to revoke the appointment,
20 designation or instruction, including, without limitation, an oral statement to a
21 health care professional.
22 3. Except as otherwise provided in section 35 of this act, an advance health-
23 care directive of an individual that conflicts with another advance health-care
24 directive revokes the earlier directive to the extent of the conflict.
25 4. Unless otherwise provided in an individual’s advance health-care
26 directive appointing an agent, the appointment of a spouse or domestic partner of
27 an individual as agent for the individual is revoked by:
28 (a) A petition for annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal
29 separation or termination that has been filed and not dismissed or withdrawn;
30 (b) A decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation
31 or termination;
32 (c) The individual and the spouse or domestic partner having agreed in a
33 record to a legal separation; or
34 (d) Abandonment of the individual for more than 1 year by the spouse or
35 domestic partner of the individual.
36 Sec. 40. 1. An advance health-care directive created outside this State is
37 valid if the advance health-care directive complies with:
38 (a) The law of the state specified in the directive or, if no state is specified,
39 the state in which the individual created the directive; or
40 (b) The provisions of NRS 162A.710, 162A.715, 162A.733, 162A.736,
41 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive, of this act.
42 2. A person may assume without inquiry that an advance health-care
43 directive is genuine, valid and still in effect and may implement or rely on it,
44 unless the person has good cause to believe that the directive is invalid or has
45 been revoked.
46 3. An advance health-care directive, revocation of a directive or a signature
47 on a directive or revocation may not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely
48 because it is in electronic form.
49 4. Evidence relating to an advance health-care directive, revocation of a
50 directive or a signature on a directive or revocation may not be excluded in a
51 proceeding solely because the evidence is in electronic form.
52 5. The provisions of NRS 162A.710, 162A.715, 162A.733, 162A.736,
53 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive, of this act do not affect

Assembly Amendment No. 182 to Assembly Bill No. 461 Page 16
1 the validity of an electronic record or signature that is valid under chapter 719 of
2 NRS.
3 6. If any provision of NRS 162A.710, 162A.715, 162A.733, 162A.736,
4 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive, of this act conflict with
5 other law of this State relating to the creation, execution, implementation or
6 revocation of an advance health-care directive, NRS 162A.710, 162A.715,
7 162A.733, 162A.736, 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3 to 52, inclusive, of
8 this act prevails.
9 Sec. 41. 1. An agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary duty to the
10 individual for whom the agent or default surrogate is acting when exercising or
11 purporting to exercise a power under section 42 of this act.
12 2. An agent or default surrogate shall make a health care decision in
13 accordance with the direction of the individual in an advance health-care
14 directive and other goals, preferences and wishes of the individual , including,
15 without limitation, those that may reflect the individual’s culture, to the extent
16 known or reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate.
17 3. If there is not a direction in an advance health-care directive and the
18 goals, preferences and wishes of the individual regarding a health care decision
19 are not known or reasonably ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate, the
20 agent or default surrogate shall make the decision in accordance with the agent’s
21 or default surrogate’s determination of the individual’s best interest.
22 4. In determining the individual’s best interest under subsection 3, the
23 agent or default surrogate shall:
24 (a) Give primary consideration to the contemporaneous communications of

27 may reflect the individual’s culture, to the extent known or reasonably
28 ascertainable by the agent or default surrogate; and
29 (c) Consider the risks and benefits of the potential health care decision.
30 5. As soon as reasonably feasible, an agent or default surrogate who is
31 informed of a revocation of an advance health-care directive or disqualification
32 of an agent or default surrogate shall communicate the revocation or
33 disqualification to a responsible health care professional.
34 Sec. 42. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the power of an
35 agent or default surrogate commences when the individual is found under
36 subsection 2 of section 29 of this act or by a court to lack capacity to make a
37 health care decision. The power ceases if the individual later is found to have
38 capacity to make a health care decision, or the individual objects under
39 subsection 3 of section 30 of this act to the finding of lack of capacity under
40 subsection 2 of section 29 of this act. The power resumes if:

45 capacity to make a health care decision.
46 2. An agent or default surrogate may request, receive, examine, copy and
47 consent to the disclosure of medical and other health care information about the

2 benefits does not, solely by reason of the power, have a duty to apply for the
3 insurance or benefits.
4 5. An agent or default surrogate may not consent to voluntary admission of
5 the individual to a facility for mental health treatment unless:

21 (b) The individual objects to the placement; and
22 (c) The individual is not terminally ill.
23 Sec. 43. 1. If an individual has a long-term disability requiring routine
24 treatment by artificial nutrition, hydration or mechanical ventilation and the
25 individual has a history of using the treatment without objection, an agent or

27 (a) The treatment is not necessary to sustain the individual’s life or maintain
28 the individual’s well-being;
29 (b) The individual has expressly authorized the withholding or withdrawal in
30 a health care instruction that has not been revoked; or

11 finding that an individual lacks capacity to make a health care decision or no

38 6. A health care professional or a health care institution may refuse to
39 provide care consistent with a health care instruction or health care decision if:
40 (a) The instruction or decision is contrary to a policy of the health care
41 institution providing health care to the individual that is expressly based on
42 reasons of conscience and the policy was timely communicated to the individual
43 or to the surrogate of the individual;
44 (b) The care would require care that is not available to the professional or

4 surrogate of the individual of the refusal;
5 (b) Immediately make a reasonable effort to transfer the individual to
6 another health care professional or health care institution that is willing to

25 good faith is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to discipline for
26 unprofessional conduct for:
