AN ACT relating to powers of attorney; enacting the provisions of
the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act that have not
been enacted into law in this State; revising various
provisions relating to powers of attorney for health care to
conform with the Uniform Act; requiring the Department
of Health and Human Services, acting through the Aging
and Disability Services Division of the Department, to
conduct a program to educate and inform residents of this
State concerning planning for long-term care; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing durable powers of attorney for
2 health care decisions. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Under existing law, a person
3 may create an advance health-care directive, which existing law defines as a power
4 of attorney for health care, by using a form set forth in the Uniform Health-Care
5 Decisions Act. (NRS 162A.715, 162A.855) Existing law also contains definitions
6 from the Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act of “guardian,” “health care” and
7 “nursing home.” This bill replaces other provisions of existing law relating to
8 powers of attorney for health care with the remaining provisions of the Uniform
9 Health-Care Decisions Act that have been enacted into law.
10 Section 28 of this bill provides that an individual has capacity to make health
11 care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive if the
12 individual: (1) is willing and able to communicate a decision independently or with
13 appropriate services, technological assistance, supported decision making or other
14 reasonable accommodations; and (2) understands the nature and consequences of
15 the action, including, with limitation, the risks and benefits of the action, or, if the
16 individual is appointing an agent to make health care decisions for the individual,
17 the individual recognizes the identity of the individual being appointed and
-
*AB461*

– 2 –
18 understands the general nature of the relationship with the individual being
19 appointed. Under section 29 of this bill, an individual is presumed to have capacity
20 to make health care decisions and make or revoke an advance health-care directive,
21 unless certain health care professionals or a court determine that the individual does
22 not have such capacity. Sections 30 and 31 of this bill require certain notice of a
23 finding that an individual lacks capacity, authorize an individual to object to the
24 finding that the individual lacks capacity and authorize certain persons to petition
25 the court to make a determination on whether the individual lacks capacity.
26 Section 32 of this bill authorizes an individual to make a health care instruction
27 which includes certain preferences regarding the health care of the individual.
28 Section 33 of this bill sets forth the requirements to execute a power of attorney
29 for health care and specifies who may not act as an agent to an individual who lacks
30 capacity.
31 Section 34 of this bill authorizes an individual to create an advance health-care
32 directive that only addresses the mental health care of the individual. Section 35 of
33 this bill sets forth the procedure to follow when an advance health-care directive
34 that addresses only the mental health care of the individual conflicts with any other
35 type of advance health-care directive.
36 Section 36 of this bill sets forth the classes of persons who, in order of priority,
37 may act as a default surrogate for an individual if the individual lacks capacity to
38 make health care decisions and an agent or guardian has not been appointed or the
39 agent or guardian of the individual is not willing or able to act or is not reasonably
40 available. Section 37 of this bill sets forth the procedure a responsible health care
41 professional is required to follow if two or more members of such a class assume
42 authority to act as a default surrogate and the default surrogates disagree on a health
43 care decision.
44 Section 38 of this bill authorizes an individual to disqualify certain persons
45 from acting as a default surrogate.
46 Section 39 of this bill authorizes an individual, under certain circumstances, to
47 revoke: (1) an appointment of an agent; (2) the designation of a default surrogate;
48 or (3) a health care instruction. Section 39 also provides that: (1) a subsequent
49 advance health-care directive revokes a prior advance health-care directive to the
50 extent the two conflict; and (2) the appointment of a spouse or domestic partner is
51 revoked under certain circumstances involving annulment, divorce, dissolution of
52 marriage, legal separation or termination of the domestic partnership.
53 Section 40 of this bill provides that: (1) an advance health-care directive
54 created outside of this State is valid in this State under certain circumstances; (2) a
55 person may rely on an advance health-care directive under certain circumstances;
56 and (3) the directive may not be denied solely because the directive or the signature
57 is in electronic form.
58 Section 41 of this bill provides that an agent or default surrogate has a fiduciary
59 duty to an individual who lacks capacity and is required to make a health care
60 decision in accordance with the direction of the individual in an advance health-
61 care directive.
62 Sections 42 and 43 of this bill set forth the powers and limitations of an agent
63 or a default surrogate under an advance health-care directive or court order.
64 Section 44 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, two or more
65 individuals are authorized to act as co-agents or alternate agents of an individual
66 under an advance health-care directive.
67 Section 45 of this bill sets forth the duties of a health care professional, a
68 responsible health care professional and a health care institution.
69 Section 46 of this bill provides that: (1) a guardian may refuse to comply with
70 or revoke the advance health-care directive of the individual only if the court
71 appointing the guardian expressly orders the noncompliance or revocation; and (2)
-
*AB461*

– 3 –
72 a health care decision made by certain agents prevails over the decision of the
73 guardian appointed for the individual, unless otherwise ordered by a court.
74 Section 47 of this bill provides that under certain circumstances, a health care
75 professional, health care institution, an agent or default surrogate acting in good
76 faith is not subject to civil or criminal liability or certain discipline.
77 Section 48 of this bill prohibits a person from taking certain actions concerning
78 an advance health-care directive. Section 48 additionally provides that an
79 individual or the estate of the individual has a cause of action against a person that
80 violates such prohibitions.
81 Section 49 of this bill provides that an electronic copy of an advance health-
82 care directive, a revocation of an advance health-care directive or a designation or
83 disqualification of a surrogate has the same effect as the original. Section 49 also
84 establishes requirements for creating a certified physical copy of an advance health-
85 care directive that is in electronic form.
86 Section 50 of this bill provides that a court acting under this Uniform Act may
87 only grant equitable relief, including, without limitation, a restraining order or
88 injunction: (1) to prevent certain the implementation of a health care decision made
89 by an agent or default surrogate that is inconsistent with the Act; (2) to prevent an
90 agent or default surrogate from making a health care decision for an individual
91 under certain circumstances; or (3) to order implementation of a health care
92 decision.
93 Section 51 of this bill provides that the Uniform Act does not authorize mercy
94 killing, assisted suicide or euthanasia.
95 Section 52 of this bill provides that in applying and construing the Uniform
96 Act, a court is required to consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among
97 jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Act.
98 Sections 1, 53-59 and 61-79 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
99 changes made in this bill and to remove and replace references to repealed sections.
100 Sections 4-27 of this bill define certain words and terms for the purposes of
101 sections 3-52 and the provisions of existing law that contain only certain provisions
102 of the Uniform Act.
103 Section 60 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services,
104 through the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department, to conduct a
105 program to educate and inform residents of this State concerning planning for long-
106 term care.

30 section 29 of this act to lack capacity, a responsible health care
31 professional, the health care institution providing health care to

35 lacks capacity.
36 2. The court in which a petition under subsection 1 is filed
37 shall appoint legal counsel to represent the individual if the
38 individual does not have legal counsel in the proceeding. The
39 court shall hear the petition as soon as possible after the petition is

20 3. A health care instruction made by an individual that

9 PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
10
11 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance
12 directive to provide consent or refuse to consent to future
13 psychiatric care if the person later becomes incapable of
14 making or communicating those decisions. By executing a
15 durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
16 [162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive,] 162A.710, 162A.715,
17 162A.733, 162A.736, 162A.755 and 162A.855 and sections 3
18 to 52, inclusive, of this act, the person may also appoint an
19 agent to make decisions regarding psychiatric care for the
20 person when incapable. A person is “incapable” for the
21 purposes of this advance directive when in the opinion of two
22 providers of health care, one of whom must be a physician or
23 licensed psychologist and the other of whom must be a
24 physician, a physician assistant, a licensed psychologist, a
25 psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who has
26 the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State
27 Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person
28 currently lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make
29 or communicate decisions regarding psychiatric care. If a
30 person is determined to be incapable, the person may be
31 found capable when, in the opinion of the person’s attending
32 physician or an advanced practice registered nurse who has
33 the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State
34 Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120 and has an
35 established relationship with the person, the person has
36 regained sufficient understanding or capacity to make or
37 communicate decisions regarding psychiatric care. This
38 document becomes effective upon its proper execution and
39 remains valid for a period of 2 years after the date of its
40 execution unless revoked. Upon being presented with this
41 advance directive, the physician or other provider of health
42 care must make it a part of the person’s medical record. The
43 physician or other provider must act in accordance with the
44 statements expressed in the advance directive when the
45 person is determined to be incapable, except as otherwise
-
*AB461*

– 39 –
1 provided in NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider
2 shall promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the
3 agent of the principal, and document in the principal’s
4 medical record any act or omission that is not in compliance
5 with any part of an advance directive. A physician or other
6 provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed,
7 dated and notarized advance directive.

17 assistant, a licensed psychologist, a psychiatrist or an
18 advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric
19 training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
20 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive
21 and evaluate information effectively or communicate
22 decisions is impaired to such an extent that I lack the capacity
23 to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I understand that
24 psychiatric care may not be administered without my express
25 and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my
26 informed consent, the express and informed consent of my
