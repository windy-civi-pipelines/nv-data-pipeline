EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising certain deadlines relating to
the return of mail ballots; revising various requirements
relating to mail ballots; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements and deadlines for a mail ballot to be
2 returned to be counted for any county or city election. (NRS 293.269921,
3 293C.26321) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require that a mail ballot must contain
4 either a date mark by the county or city clerk or a postmark by the United States
5 Postal Service to be counted.
6 Existing law requires the county or city clerk to establish procedures for the
7 processing and counting of mail ballots. (NRS 293.269925, 293C.26325) Sections
8 3 and 6 of this bill require the county or city clerk to establish procedures to date
9 mark each mail ballot, other than a mail ballot which contains a postmark by the
10 United States Postal Service, with the date the mail ballot was returned by or
11 otherwise caused to be returned by a voter.
12 Existing law requires that a mail ballot that is mailed to the county or city clerk
13 be postmarked on or before the day of the election and received by 5 p.m. on the
14 fourth day following an election. (NRS 293.269921, 293.269923, 293C.26321,
15 293C.26323) Sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 of this bill revise this deadline to instead
16 require that a mail ballot that is mailed to a county or city clerk be postmarked on
17 or before the last day of the period for early voting and received before the time set
18 for closing of the polls on the day of the election.
19 Existing law provides that a mail ballot received by mail not later than 5 p.m.
20 on the third day following the election and on which the postmark cannot be
21 determined is deemed to have been postmarked on or before the day of the election.
22 (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 1 and 4 eliminate these provisions and
23 instead establish that a mail ballot received later than the day of the election must
24 not be counted.
