AN ACT relating to food dispensing establishments; prohibiting certain food
dispensing establishments from selling, preparing, providing or
transporting food or beverages using disposable foodware containers
made from polystyrene foam; providing civil penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements for food establishments. (Chapter 446 of
2 NRS) Beginning on [July] October 1, 2025, section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a food
3 dispensing establishment with 10 or more locations doing business in this State which offer a
4 menu of substantially similar items from selling, preparing, providing or transporting food or
5 beverages using a disposable foodware container that is made wholly or partially from
6 polystyrene foam; and (2) makes a willful and knowing violation of this prohibition subject to
7 a civil penalty not to exceed [$1,000] $100 per day for each day upon which such a
8 violation [.] occurs. Section 3 exempts from this prohibition a food dispensing establishment
9 that is part of a business that has less than 10 locations in this State, unless the food
10 dispensing establishment has 1 or more locations doing business in states other than Nevada
11 which have prohibited the use of disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially
12 from polystyrene foam. If, before [July] October 1, 2025, an owner or operator of a food
13 dispensing establishment purchased disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially
14 from polystyrene foam, section 6 of this bill authorizes the food dispensing establishment to
15 use the remaining inventory of such disposable foodware containers.
16 Beginning on January 1, 2029, section 5 of this bill prohibits any food dispensing
17 establishment from selling, preparing, providing or transporting food or beverages using
18 disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially from polystyrene foam.
19 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to food establishments
20 to the provisions of section 3.
21 Section 4 of this bill provides that a violation of this prohibition is not a misdemeanor.
