Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements for food establishments. (Chapter
2 446 of NRS) Beginning on July 1, 2025, section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a food
3 establishment with 10 or more locations doing business in this State which offer a
4 menu of substantially similar items from selling, preparing, providing or
5 transporting food or beverages using a disposable foodware container that is made
6 wholly or partially from polystyrene foam; and (2) makes a willful and knowing
7 violation of this prohibition subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each
8 violation. Section 3 exempts from this prohibition a food establishment that is part
9 of a business that has less than 10 locations in this State, unless the food
10 establishment has 1 or more locations doing business in states other than Nevada
11 which have prohibited the use of disposable foodware containers made wholly or
12 partially from polystyrene foam. If, before July 1, 2025, an owner or operator of a
13 food establishment purchased disposable foodware containers made wholly or
14 partially from polystyrene foam, section 6 of this bill authorizes the food
15 establishment to use the remaining inventory of such disposable foodware
16 containers.
17 Beginning on January 1, 2029, section 5 of this bill prohibits any food
18 establishment from selling, preparing, providing or transporting food or beverages
19 using disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially from polystyrene
