Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements for food establishments. (Chapter
2 446 of NRS) Beginning on October 1, 2025, section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a
3 food dispensing establishment with 10 or more locations doing business in this
4 State which offer a menu of substantially similar items from selling, preparing,
5 providing or transporting food or beverages using a disposable foodware container
6 that is made wholly or partially from polystyrene foam; and (2) makes a willful and
7 knowing violation of this prohibition subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100
8 per day for each day upon which such a violation occurs. Section 3 exempts from
9 this prohibition a food dispensing establishment that is part of a business that has
10 less than 10 locations in this State, unless the food dispensing establishment has 1
11 or more locations doing business in states other than Nevada which have prohibited
12 the use of disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially from
13 polystyrene foam. If, before October 1, 2025, an owner or operator of a food
14 dispensing establishment purchased disposable foodware containers made wholly
15 or partially from polystyrene foam, section 6 of this bill authorizes the food
16 dispensing establishment to use the remaining inventory of such disposable
17 foodware containers.
