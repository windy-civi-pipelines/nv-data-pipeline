Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to food dispensing establishments; prohibiting
certain food dispensing establishments from selling,
preparing, providing or transporting food or beverages using
disposable foodware containers made from polystyrene foam;
providing civil penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes various requirements for food establishments. (Chapter
446 of NRS) Beginning on October 1, 2025, section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a
food dispensing establishment with 10 or more locations doing business in this
State which offer a menu of substantially similar items from selling, preparing,
providing or transporting food or beverages using a disposable foodware container
that is made wholly or partially from polystyrene foam; and (2) makes a willful and
knowing violation of this prohibition subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100
per day for each day upon which such a violation occurs. Section 3 exempts from
this prohibition a food dispensing establishment that is part of a business that has
less than 10 locations in this State, unless the food dispensing establishment has 1
or more locations doing business in states other than Nevada which have prohibited
the use of disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially from
polystyrene foam. If, before October 1, 2025, an owner or operator of a food
dispensing establishment purchased disposable foodware containers made wholly
or partially from polystyrene foam, section 6 of this bill authorizes the food
dispensing establishment to use the remaining inventory of such disposable
foodware containers.
Beginning on January 1, 2029, section 5 of this bill prohibits any food
dispensing establishment from selling, preparing, providing or transporting food or
beverages using disposable foodware containers made wholly or partially from
polystyrene foam.

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to food
establishments to the provisions of section 3.

Section 3:
Section 4 of this bill provides that a violation of this prohibition is not a
misdemeanor.
