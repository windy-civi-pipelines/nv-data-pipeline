Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation and oversight of certain credit unions by the
2 Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 672 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes
3 the Commissioner to issue an order which temporarily suspends a regulation of the
4 Commissioner relating to credit unions for not more than 90 days: (1) during a state of
5 emergency or declaration of disaster; or (2) if the Commissioner determines the order is in the
6 public interest. Section 2 requires: (1) such an order to contain certain information and meet
7 certain requirements; and (2) the Commissioner to provide written notice and a copy of any
8 such order to any credit union subject to the authority of the Commissioner. Section 15 of this
9 bill exempts any order issued by the Commissioner pursuant to section 2 from the
10 requirements of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
11 Existing law requires an application which is submitted to the Secretary of State to
12 organize a credit union to establish the par value of the shares, which must be $5 or some
13 multiple thereof. (NRS 672.310) Section 3 of this bill reduces the required par value to $1 or
14 some multiple thereof. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the bylaws of the credit union to: (1)
15 specify a dollar amount for the par value of a share; or (2) require the par value of a share to
16 be determined from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. Section 1 of this bill
17 authorizes a credit union that qualifies and is approved for designation as a low-income
18 credit union to issue shares to nonmembers under certain circumstances.
19 Existing law authorizes a credit union to maintain an office at a location other than the
20 main office, with the approval of the Commissioner, if the office is reasonably necessary to
21 furnish service to its members. (NRS 672.330) Section 4 of this bill: (1) removes the

Senate Amendment No. 316 to Senate Bill No. 375 Page 4
22 requirement to determine whether an office is reasonably necessary to furnish such service;
23 and (2) requires the Commissioner to approve or deny any application to open an additional
24 office within 60 days after receiving the application.
25 Existing law requires vacancies in the board of directors of a credit union to be filled by
26 vote of the members of the credit union at the annual meeting or at a special meeting called
27 for that purpose. Existing law also authorizes the board to temporarily fill such a vacancy until
28 the next annual meeting or special meeting. (NRS 672.350) Section 5 of this bill authorizes
29 the board to fill such a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term, after which the seat is
30 required to be filled by vote of the members of the credit union according to the established
31 procedures of the credit union for nomination and election.
32 Existing law requires the board of directors of a credit union to meet not less than once a
33 month. (NRS 672.360) Section 6 of this bill requires the board to meet not less than six times
34 during each calendar year, including not less than one time during each calendar quarter.
35 Section 6 also authorizes the Commissioner to require the board to meet more frequently if
36 the Commissioner determines it is necessary to address matters relating to an examination.
37 Finally, section 6 authorizes the board to conduct a meeting through certain electronic means
38 under certain circumstances. Section 10 of this bill similarly authorizes members of a credit
39 union to participate in a meeting through certain electronic means under certain
40 circumstances.
41 Existing law authorizes the board of directors to appoint membership officers from the
42 members of the credit union to act upon membership applications. (NRS 672.380) Section 7
43 of this bill authorizes the board to appoint officers, directors or employees of the credit union
44 to act as membership officers. Existing law requires the membership of a particular credit
45 union to be limited to certain persons, including those who have: (1) paid the entrance fee
46 provided in the bylaws; and (2) subscribed for one or more shares and have paid the initial
47 installment thereon. (NRS 672.510) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a credit union to pay such
48 an entrance fee, cost of shares or initial installment for a prospective member under certain
49 circumstances if such a promotion is equally available to any prospective member.
50 Existing law sets forth requirements relating to the regular reserves of a credit union.
51 (NRS 672.670) Section 11 of this bill removes those specific requirements and instead
52 requires a credit union to comply with certain provisions of federal regulations. Existing law
53 authorizes a credit union to make loans to members under certain circumstances. (NRS
54 672.710) Section 12 of this bill revises certain requirements for the making of loans and
55 authorizes a nonmember to participate in an obligation or extension of credit to a member,
56 under certain circumstances, as a joint applicant, joint obligor, co-borrower, surety or
57 guarantor. Existing law authorizes a credit union to make certain investments with money not
58 used in loans to members. (NRS 672.760) Section 13 of this bill adds, under certain
59 circumstances, municipal bonds which are issued by a public entity outside of this State to the
60 list of permissible investments a credit union may make. [Section 13 also authorizes the
61 Commissioner to adopt regulations or give written authorization upon request of a particular
62 credit union which authorize a credit union to make other investments.] Section 14 of this bill:
63 (1) removes certain limitations on a credit union regarding investing in fixed assets; and (2)
64 authorizes a credit union to purchase, hold and dispose of property necessary or incidental to
65 the operations of the credit union in compliance with certain federal regulations.
