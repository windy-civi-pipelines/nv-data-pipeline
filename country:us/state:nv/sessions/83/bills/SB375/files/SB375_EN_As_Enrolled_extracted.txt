CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to credit unions; authorizing a credit union which
is a low-income credit union to issue shares to nonmembers
under certain circumstances; authorizing the Commissioner
of Financial Institutions to temporarily suspend certain
regulations under certain circumstances; requiring the
Commissioner to approve or deny an application to open an
additional office within 60 days after receipt of the
application; revising requirements for the par value of shares
of a credit union; revising provisions relating to certain

board of directors of a credit union; revising provisions
relating to membership in a credit union; revising provisions
relating to certain reserves, loans and investments of a credit
union; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the regulation and oversight of certain credit unions
by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 672 of NRS) Section 2 of
this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue an order which temporarily suspends
a regulation of the Commissioner relating to credit unions for not more than 90
days: (1) during a state of emergency or declaration of disaster; or (2) if the
Commissioner determines the order is in the public interest. Section 2 requires: (1)
such an order to contain certain information and meet certain requirements; and (2)
the Commissioner to provide written notice and a copy of any such order to any
credit union subject to the authority of the Commissioner. Section 15 of this bill
exempts any order issued by the Commissioner pursuant to section 2 from the
requirements of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
Existing law requires an application which is submitted to the Secretary of
State to organize a credit union to establish the par value of the shares, which must
be $5 or some multiple thereof. (NRS 672.310) Section 3 of this bill reduces the
required par value to $1 or some multiple thereof. Section 9 of this bill authorizes
the bylaws of the credit union to: (1) specify a dollar amount for the par value of a
share; or (2) require the par value of a share to be determined from time to time by
resolution of the board of directors. Section 1 of this bill authorizes a credit union
that qualifies and is approved for designation as a low-income credit union to issue
shares to nonmembers under certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes a credit union to maintain an office at a location other
than the main office, with the approval of the Commissioner, if the office is
reasonably necessary to furnish service to its members. (NRS 672.330) Section 4 of
this bill: (1) removes the requirement to determine whether an office is reasonably
necessary to furnish such service; and (2) requires the Commissioner to approve or
deny any application to open an additional office within 60 days after receiving the
application.
Existing law requires vacancies in the board of directors of a credit union to be
filled by vote of the members of the credit union at the annual meeting or at a
special meeting called for that purpose. Existing law also authorizes the board to
temporarily fill such a vacancy until the next annual meeting or special meeting.
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
(NRS 672.350) Section 5 of this bill authorizes the board to fill such a vacancy for
the remainder of the unexpired term, after which the seat is required to be filled by
vote of the members of the credit union according to the established procedures of
the credit union for nomination and election.
Existing law requires the board of directors of a credit union to meet not less
than once a month. (NRS 672.360) Section 6 of this bill requires the board to meet
not less than six times during each calendar year, including not less than one time
during each calendar quarter. Section 6 also authorizes the Commissioner to
require the board to meet more frequently if the Commissioner determines it is
necessary to address matters relating to an examination. Finally, section 6
authorizes the board to conduct a meeting through certain electronic means under
certain circumstances. Section 10 of this bill similarly authorizes members of a
credit union to participate in a meeting through certain electronic means under
certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes the board of directors to appoint membership officers
from the members of the credit union to act upon membership applications. (NRS

Section 2:
672.380) Section 7 of this bill authorizes the board to appoint officers, directors or
employees of the credit union to act as membership officers. Existing law requires
the membership of a particular credit union to be limited to certain persons,
including those who have: (1) paid the entrance fee provided in the bylaws; and (2)
subscribed for one or more shares and have paid the initial installment thereon.
(NRS 672.510) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a credit union to pay such an
entrance fee, cost of shares or initial installment for a prospective member under
certain circumstances if such a promotion is equally available to any prospective
member.
Existing law sets forth requirements relating to the regular reserves of a credit
union. (NRS 672.670) Section 11 of this bill removes those specific requirements
and instead requires a credit union to comply with certain provisions of federal
regulations. Existing law authorizes a credit union to make loans to members under
certain circumstances. (NRS 672.710) Section 12 of this bill revises certain
requirements for the making of loans and authorizes a nonmember to participate in
an obligation or extension of credit to a member, under certain circumstances, as a
joint applicant, joint obligor, co-borrower, surety or guarantor. Existing law
authorizes a credit union to make certain investments with money not used in loans
to members. (NRS 672.760) Section 13 of this bill adds, under certain
circumstances, municipal bonds which are issued by a public entity outside of this
State to the list of permissible investments a credit union may make. Section 14 of
this bill: (1) removes certain limitations on a credit union regarding investing in
fixed assets; and (2) authorizes a credit union to purchase, hold and dispose of
property necessary or incidental to the operations of the credit union in compliance
with certain federal regulations.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 375–Senator Pazina
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to credit unions; authorizing a credit union which
is a low-income credit union to issue shares to nonmembers
under certain circumstances; authorizing the Commissioner
of Financial Institutions to temporarily suspend certain
regulations under certain circumstances; requiring the
Commissioner to approve or deny an application to open an
additional office within 60 days after receipt of the
application; revising requirements for the par value of shares
of a credit union; revising provisions relating to certain
operations of a credit union; revising requirements for the
board of directors of a credit union; revising provisions
relating to membership in a credit union; revising provisions
relating to certain reserves, loans and investments of a credit
union; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the regulation and oversight of certain credit unions
by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 672 of NRS) Section 2 of
this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue an order which temporarily suspends
a regulation of the Commissioner relating to credit unions for not more than 90
days: (1) during a state of emergency or declaration of disaster; or (2) if the
Commissioner determines the order is in the public interest. Section 2 requires: (1)
such an order to contain certain information and meet certain requirements; and (2)
the Commissioner to provide written notice and a copy of any such order to any
credit union subject to the authority of the Commissioner. Section 15 of this bill
exempts any order issued by the Commissioner pursuant to section 2 from the
requirements of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
Existing law requires an application which is submitted to the Secretary of
State to organize a credit union to establish the par value of the shares, which must
be $5 or some multiple thereof. (NRS 672.310) Section 3 of this bill reduces the
required par value to $1 or some multiple thereof. Section 9 of this bill authorizes
the bylaws of the credit union to: (1) specify a dollar amount for the par value of a
share; or (2) require the par value of a share to be determined from time to time by
resolution of the board of directors. Section 1 of this bill authorizes a credit union
that qualifies and is approved for designation as a low-income credit union to issue
shares to nonmembers under certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes a credit union to maintain an office at a location other
than the main office, with the approval of the Commissioner, if the office is
reasonably necessary to furnish service to its members. (NRS 672.330) Section 4 of
this bill: (1) removes the requirement to determine whether an office is reasonably
necessary to furnish such service; and (2) requires the Commissioner to approve or
deny any application to open an additional office within 60 days after receiving the
application.
Existing law requires vacancies in the board of directors of a credit union to be
filled by vote of the members of the credit union at the annual meeting or at a
special meeting called for that purpose. Existing law also authorizes the board to
temporarily fill such a vacancy until the next annual meeting or special meeting.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
(NRS 672.350) Section 5 of this bill authorizes the board to fill such a vacancy for
the remainder of the unexpired term, after which the seat is required to be filled by
vote of the members of the credit union according to the established procedures of
the credit union for nomination and election.
Existing law requires the board of directors of a credit union to meet not less
than once a month. (NRS 672.360) Section 6 of this bill requires the board to meet
not less than six times during each calendar year, including not less than one time
during each calendar quarter. Section 6 also authorizes the Commissioner to
require the board to meet more frequently if the Commissioner determines it is
necessary to address matters relating to an examination. Finally, section 6
authorizes the board to conduct a meeting through certain electronic means under
certain circumstances. Section 10 of this bill similarly authorizes members of a
credit union to participate in a meeting through certain electronic means under
certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes the board of directors to appoint membership officers
from the members of the credit union to act upon membership applications. (NRS
672.380) Section 7 of this bill authorizes the board to appoint officers, directors or
employees of the credit union to act as membership officers. Existing law requires
the membership of a particular credit union to be limited to certain persons,
including those who have: (1) paid the entrance fee provided in the bylaws; and (2)
subscribed for one or more shares and have paid the initial installment thereon.
(NRS 672.510) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a credit union to pay such an
entrance fee, cost of shares or initial installment for a prospective member under
certain circumstances if such a promotion is equally available to any prospective
member.
Existing law sets forth requirements relating to the regular reserves of a credit
union. (NRS 672.670) Section 11 of this bill removes those specific requirements
and instead requires a credit union to comply with certain provisions of federal
regulations. Existing law authorizes a credit union to make loans to members under
certain circumstances. (NRS 672.710) Section 12 of this bill revises certain
requirements for the making of loans and authorizes a nonmember to participate in
an obligation or extension of credit to a member, under certain circumstances, as a
joint applicant, joint obligor, co-borrower, surety or guarantor. Existing law
authorizes a credit union to make certain investments with money not used in loans
to members. (NRS 672.760) Section 13 of this bill adds, under certain
circumstances, municipal bonds which are issued by a public entity outside of this
State to the list of permissible investments a credit union may make. Section 14 of
this bill: (1) removes certain limitations on a credit union regarding investing in
fixed assets; and (2) authorizes a credit union to purchase, hold and dispose of
property necessary or incidental to the operations of the credit union in compliance
with certain federal regulations.
