Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation and oversight of certain credit unions
2 by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 672 of NRS) Section 2 of
3 this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue an order which temporarily suspends
4 a regulation of the Commissioner relating to credit unions for not more than 90
5 days: (1) during a state of emergency or declaration of disaster; or (2) if the
6 Commissioner determines the order is in the public interest. Section 2 requires: (1)
7 such an order to contain certain information and meet certain requirements; and (2)
8 the Commissioner to provide written notice and a copy of any such order to any
9 credit union subject to the authority of the Commissioner. Section 15 of this bill
10 exempts any order issued by the Commissioner pursuant to section 2 from the
11 requirements of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.

12 Existing law requires an application which is submitted to the Secretary of
13 State to organize a credit union to establish the par value of the shares, which must
14 be $5 or some multiple thereof. (NRS 672.310) Section 3 of this bill reduces the
15 required par value to $1 or some multiple thereof. Section 9 of this bill authorizes
16 the bylaws of the credit union to: (1) specify a dollar amount for the par value of a
17 share; or (2) require the par value of a share to be determined from time to time by
18 resolution of the board of directors. Section 1 of this bill authorizes a credit union
19 that qualifies and is approved for designation as a low-income credit union to issue
20 shares to nonmembers under certain circumstances.
21 Existing law authorizes a credit union to maintain an office at a location other
22 than the main office, with the approval of the Commissioner, if the office is
23 reasonably necessary to furnish service to its members. (NRS 672.330) Section 4 of
24 this bill: (1) removes the requirement to determine whether an office is reasonably
25 necessary to furnish such service; and (2) requires the Commissioner to approve or
26 deny any application to open an additional office within 60 days after receiving the
27 application.
28 Existing law requires vacancies in the board of directors of a credit union to be
29 filled by vote of the members of the credit union at the annual meeting or at a
30 special meeting called for that purpose. Existing law also authorizes the board to
31 temporarily fill such a vacancy until the next annual meeting or special meeting.
32 (NRS 672.350) Section 5 of this bill authorizes the board to fill such a vacancy for
33 the remainder of the unexpired term, after which the seat is required to be filled by
34 vote of the members of the credit union according to the established procedures of
35 the credit union for nomination and election.
36 Existing law requires the board of directors of a credit union to meet not less
37 than once a month. (NRS 672.360) Section 6 of this bill requires the board to meet
38 not less than six times during each calendar year, including not less than one time
39 during each calendar quarter. Section 6 also authorizes the Commissioner to
40 require the board to meet more frequently if the Commissioner determines it is
41 necessary to address matters relating to an examination. Finally, section 6
42 authorizes the board to conduct a meeting through certain electronic means under
43 certain circumstances. Section 10 of this bill similarly authorizes members of a
44 credit union to participate in a meeting through certain electronic means under
45 certain circumstances.
46 Existing law authorizes the board of directors to appoint membership officers
47 from the members of the credit union to act upon membership applications. (NRS
48 672.380) Section 7 of this bill authorizes the board to appoint officers, directors or
49 employees of the credit union to act as membership officers. Existing law requires
50 the membership of a particular credit union to be limited to certain persons,
51 including those who have: (1) paid the entrance fee provided in the bylaws; and (2)
52 subscribed for one or more shares and have paid the initial installment thereon.
53 (NRS 672.510) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a credit union to pay such an
54 entrance fee, cost of shares or initial installment for a prospective member under
55 certain circumstances if such a promotion is equally available to any prospective
56 member.
57 Existing law sets forth requirements relating to the regular reserves of a credit
58 union. (NRS 672.670) Section 11 of this bill removes those specific requirements
59 and instead requires a credit union to comply with certain provisions of federal
60 regulations. Existing law authorizes a credit union to make loans to members under
61 certain circumstances. (NRS 672.710) Section 12 of this bill revises certain
62 requirements for the making of loans and authorizes a nonmember to participate in
63 an obligation or extension of credit to a member, under certain circumstances, as a
64 joint applicant, joint obligor, co-borrower, surety or guarantor. Existing law
65 authorizes a credit union to make certain investments with money not used in loans
66 to members. (NRS 672.760) Section 13 of this bill adds, under certain
-
*SB375_R1*
– 3 –
67 circumstances, municipal bonds which are issued by a public entity outside of this
68 State to the list of permissible investments a credit union may make. Section 14 of
69 this bill: (1) removes certain limitations on a credit union regarding investing in
70 fixed assets; and (2) authorizes a credit union to purchase, hold and dispose of
71 property necessary or incidental to the operations of the credit union in compliance
72 with certain federal regulations.

AN ACT relating to credit unions; authorizing a credit union which
is a low-income credit union to issue shares to
nonmembers under certain circumstances; authorizing the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions to temporarily
suspend certain regulations under certain circumstances;
requiring the Commissioner to approve or deny an
application to open an additional office within 60 days
after receipt of the application; revising requirements for

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation and oversight of certain credit unions
2 by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 672 of NRS) Section 2 of
3 this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue an order which temporarily suspends
4 a regulation of the Commissioner relating to credit unions for not more than 90
5 days: (1) during a state of emergency or declaration of disaster; or (2) if the
6 Commissioner determines the order is in the public interest. Section 2 requires: (1)
7 such an order to contain certain information and meet certain requirements; and (2)
8 the Commissioner to provide written notice and a copy of any such order to any
9 credit union subject to the authority of the Commissioner. Section 15 of this bill
10 exempts any order issued by the Commissioner pursuant to section 2 from the
11 requirements of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
-
*SB375_R1*

– 2 –
12 Existing law requires an application which is submitted to the Secretary of
13 State to organize a credit union to establish the par value of the shares, which must
14 be $5 or some multiple thereof. (NRS 672.310) Section 3 of this bill reduces the
15 required par value to $1 or some multiple thereof. Section 9 of this bill authorizes
16 the bylaws of the credit union to: (1) specify a dollar amount for the par value of a
17 share; or (2) require the par value of a share to be determined from time to time by
18 resolution of the board of directors. Section 1 of this bill authorizes a credit union
19 that qualifies and is approved for designation as a low-income credit union to issue
20 shares to nonmembers under certain circumstances.
21 Existing law authorizes a credit union to maintain an office at a location other
22 than the main office, with the approval of the Commissioner, if the office is
23 reasonably necessary to furnish service to its members. (NRS 672.330) Section 4 of
24 this bill: (1) removes the requirement to determine whether an office is reasonably
25 necessary to furnish such service; and (2) requires the Commissioner to approve or
26 deny any application to open an additional office within 60 days after receiving the
27 application.
28 Existing law requires vacancies in the board of directors of a credit union to be
29 filled by vote of the members of the credit union at the annual meeting or at a
30 special meeting called for that purpose. Existing law also authorizes the board to
31 temporarily fill such a vacancy until the next annual meeting or special meeting.
32 (NRS 672.350) Section 5 of this bill authorizes the board to fill such a vacancy for
33 the remainder of the unexpired term, after which the seat is required to be filled by
34 vote of the members of the credit union according to the established procedures of
35 the credit union for nomination and election.
36 Existing law requires the board of directors of a credit union to meet not less
37 than once a month. (NRS 672.360) Section 6 of this bill requires the board to meet
38 not less than six times during each calendar year, including not less than one time
39 during each calendar quarter. Section 6 also authorizes the Commissioner to
40 require the board to meet more frequently if the Commissioner determines it is
41 necessary to address matters relating to an examination. Finally, section 6
42 authorizes the board to conduct a meeting through certain electronic means under
43 certain circumstances. Section 10 of this bill similarly authorizes members of a
44 credit union to participate in a meeting through certain electronic means under
45 certain circumstances.
46 Existing law authorizes the board of directors to appoint membership officers
47 from the members of the credit union to act upon membership applications. (NRS
48 672.380) Section 7 of this bill authorizes the board to appoint officers, directors or
49 employees of the credit union to act as membership officers. Existing law requires
50 the membership of a particular credit union to be limited to certain persons,
51 including those who have: (1) paid the entrance fee provided in the bylaws; and (2)
52 subscribed for one or more shares and have paid the initial installment thereon.
53 (NRS 672.510) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a credit union to pay such an
54 entrance fee, cost of shares or initial installment for a prospective member under
55 certain circumstances if such a promotion is equally available to any prospective
56 member.
57 Existing law sets forth requirements relating to the regular reserves of a credit
58 union. (NRS 672.670) Section 11 of this bill removes those specific requirements
59 and instead requires a credit union to comply with certain provisions of federal
60 regulations. Existing law authorizes a credit union to make loans to members under
61 certain circumstances. (NRS 672.710) Section 12 of this bill revises certain
62 requirements for the making of loans and authorizes a nonmember to participate in
63 an obligation or extension of credit to a member, under certain circumstances, as a
64 joint applicant, joint obligor, co-borrower, surety or guarantor. Existing law
65 authorizes a credit union to make certain investments with money not used in loans
66 to members. (NRS 672.760) Section 13 of this bill adds, under certain
-
*SB375_R1*

– 3 –
67 circumstances, municipal bonds which are issued by a public entity outside of this
68 State to the list of permissible investments a credit union may make. Section 14 of
69 this bill: (1) removes certain limitations on a credit union regarding investing in
70 fixed assets; and (2) authorizes a credit union to purchase, hold and dispose of
71 property necessary or incidental to the operations of the credit union in compliance
72 with certain federal regulations.
