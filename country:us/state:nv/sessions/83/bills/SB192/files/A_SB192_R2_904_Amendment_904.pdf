AN ACT relating to public health; imposing requirements relating to birth in a
hospital or freestanding birthing center; requiring health insurance to
include certain coverage; requiring the boards of trustees of certain
school districts to adopt policies to prevent sudden cardiac arrest
during the participation of pupils in certain sports; requiring an
independent mental health assessment of certain children in the
custody of a child welfare agency; [requiring the reporting and review
of certain transactions relating to health care; prohibiting the
consummation of such a transaction without the approval of the
Attorney General;] prohibiting the use of race-based health formulas
and race-based care standards in certain circumstances; prohibiting a
health insurer from engaging in certain discrimination against solo
practitioners; providing for a study of certain disparities relating to
health care; providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require providers of health care and health care facilities that
2 receive funding or certain other assistance from the Federal Government to ensure that
3 communications with persons with disabilities are as effective as communications with
4 persons who do not have disabilities. (45 C.F.R. § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1)
5 prohibit such providers and facilities from requiring a person with a disability to be
6 accompanied by a person to interpret for him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and
7 facilities to provide qualified interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28
8 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45 C.F.R. § 92.202) Section 1 of this bill requires a hospital or freestanding
9 birthing center to provide a qualified sign language interpreter to a patient who is at the
10 hospital or freestanding birthing center for the purpose of giving birth, except where providing
11 such an interpreter would be impractical or delay necessary care. Section 1 also requires a
12 hospital or freestanding birthing center to allow a family member of the patient and a doula to
13 be present in the room with the patient during the birthing process. Sections 2-6 of this bill
14 make conforming changes relating to the applicability and enforcement of section 1.

Assembly Amendment No. 904 to Senate Bill No. 192 Second Reprint Page 4
15 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover doula services provided by a doula who enrolls
16 with the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and
17 Human Services. (NRS 422.27177) Sections 18, 43, 46, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56 and 61 of this
18 bill require various other public and private insurers who cover maternity care to: (1) cover
19 doula services; and (2) include doulas in their networks of providers. Section 45 of this bill
20 authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance
21 issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage
22 required by section 43. Section 60 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or
23 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
24 required by section 55. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action against other
25 health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections 43, 46, 48, 50, 51, 53
26 and 61. (NRS 680A.200)
27 Existing law requires certain health insurers, including Medicaid managed care
28 organizations and insurance for state and local governmental employees, to cover hormone
29 replacement therapy to varying degrees. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 689A.0415, 689B.0376,
30 689C.1678, 695A.1875, 695B.1916, 695C.050, 695C.1694, 695G.1717) Sections 44, 47, 49,
31 52, 54, 58 and 64 of this bill require such coverage to include coverage of testosterone
32 replacement therapy for menopausal women. Section 67.5 of this bill requires: (1) [those]
33 private insurers to submit to the Commissioner a plan for complying with that requirement on
34 or before January 1, 2026; and (2) the Commissioner to evaluate those plans and post a
35 bulletin on or before February 1, 2026, stating whether each such insurer is likely to be in
36 compliance with that requirement. Section 42 of this bill prohibits certain health insurers from
37 denying a request to include a provider of health care in a provider network because the
38 provider of health care is a solo practitioner.
39 Existing law requires: (1) the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
40 body of each charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils to adopt a policy
41 for the prevention and treatment of injuries to the head of a pupil; and (2) the board of trustees
42 of each school district and the governing body of each charter school to adopt a policy
43 concerning safe exposure to the sun. (NRS 392.452, 392.453) Section 19 of this bill
44 additionally requires the board of trustees of each school district which has more than 100,000
45 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently only the Clark County School District) to adopt
46 a policy concerning the prevention of sudden cardiac arrest during the participation of pupils
47 in competitive sports sponsored by a school.
48 Existing law authorizes a court that finds a child to be in need of protection to place the
49 child in the temporary custody of a public or private agency or institution. (NRS 432B.550) If
50 such a child is placed in the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services and
51 has been diagnosed with a mental or behavioral health condition before or after such
52 placement, section 22 of this bill requires the agency which provides child welfare services to
53 provide for an independent assessment of the child before the child leaves the custody of the
54 agency which provides child welfare services. Section 22 provides that this requirement does
55 not apply if a prior assessment conducted after the initial diagnosis has determined that the
56 child no longer has a mental or behavioral health condition. Sections 7 and 23-25 of this bill
57 make conforming changes to make various provisions governing child welfare proceedings
58 generally applicable to any proceeding related to the provisions of section 22. Section 33.5 of
59 this bill makes a conforming change to require the State Board of Nursing to establish
60 qualifications for an advanced practice registered nurse to conduct an assessment pursuant to
61 section 22.
62 [Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices. (NRS 598A.060) Existing law
63 requires the notification of the Attorney General not later than 30 days before the
64 consummation of certain mergers, acquisitions or other transactions involving health carriers
65 or group practices of certain practitioners. (NRS 598A.290-598A.430) Sections 26.1, 26.2,
66 26.5-26.7 and 26.85 of this bill broaden the applicability of that requirement to also include:
67 (1) such transactions involving health care facilities, private providers of emergency medical
68 services and group practices of certain additional practitioners; and (2) certain additional
69 transactions. Sections 26.8 and 26.85 of this bill require the notice to be provided to the
70 Attorney General not later than 60 days, rather than 30 days, before the consummation of the
71 transaction. Section 26.3 of this bill requires the Attorney General, after receiving such notice,
72 to: (1) post certain information concerning the transaction on an Internet website maintained
73 by the Attorney General; and (2) hold a public hearing to allow for comment on the

Assembly Amendment No. 904 to Senate Bill No. 192 Second Reprint Page 5
74 transaction from interested persons and the public. Section 26.9 of this bill makes a
75 conforming change to exempt information that section 26.3 requires the Attorney General to
76 post on the Internet from requirements governing the confidentiality of information
77 concerning reportable transactions. Section 26.3 authorizes the Attorney General to require
78 any entity involved in a reportable transaction to submit a report that contains certain
79 additional information about the transaction. Section 26.3 requires the Attorney General to
80 review and approve, deny or impose conditions on the transaction. Section 26.35 of this bill
81 makes consummating a reportable transaction without the approval of the Attorney General or
82 in violation of any condition imposed by the Attorney General an unfair trade practice. The
83 Attorney General would be authorized to bring a civil action against a health carrier or health
84 insurance administrator who violates that prohibition. (NRS 598A.160, 598A.180-598A.210)
85 Additionally, any person or entity who commits such a violation would be subject to criminal
86 and civil penalties. (NRS 598A.170, 598A.280) Section 26.95 of this bill: (1) authorizes the
87 imposition of a civil penalty for a willful violation of sections 26.1-26.3; and (2) provides that
88 a violation of sections 26.1-26.3 or the consummation of a reportable transaction in violation
89 of section 26.35 does not give rise to a private cause of action. Section 26.4 of this bill makes
90 a conforming change to indicate the applicability of certain definitions.]
91 Existing law provides for the regulation of the practices of medicine, nursing and
92 osteopathic medicine by the Board of Medical Examiners, the State Board of Nursing and the
93 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively. (Chapters 630, 632 and 633 of NRS)
94 Sections 29, 32 and 35 of this bill: (1) require those boards to adopt regulations prescribing a
95 list of race-based health formulas and race-based care standards that are authorized for use by
96 licensees in this State; (2) prohibit those boards from including on that list any race-based
97 health formula or race-based care standard if there is a race-neutral health formula or race-
98 neutral care standard that has been scientifically validated as being at least as effective for the
99 same purpose; and (3) prohibit a physician, physician assistant, nurse or osteopathic physician
100 from using or authorizing the use of a race-based health formula or race-based care standard
101 that is not included on the list. Section 65 of this bill requires the Board of Medical
102 Examiners, the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, the University of Nevada, Reno, School
103 of Medicine and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of Medicine to study disparities
104 in health care access, the provision of health care and health care outcomes.

12 for the patient.
13 2. At the request of a patient who is giving birth, a hospital or freestanding
14 birthing center shall allow a family member of the patient and a doula to be
