Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require providers of health care and health care
2 facilities that receive funding or certain other assistance from the Federal
3 Government to ensure that communications with persons with disabilities are as
4 effective as communications with persons who do not have disabilities. (45 C.F.R.
5 § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1) prohibit such providers and facilities from
6 requiring a person with a disability to be accompanied by a person to interpret for
7 him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and facilities to provide qualified
8 interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45
9 C.F.R. § 92.202) Section 1 of this bill requires a hospital or freestanding birthing
10 center to provide a qualified sign language interpreter to a patient who is at the
-
*SB192_R3*

– 2 –
11 hospital or freestanding birthing center for the purpose of giving birth, except
12 where providing such an interpreter would be impractical or delay necessary care.
13 Section 1 also requires a hospital or freestanding birthing center to allow a family
14 member of the patient and a doula to be present in the room with the patient during
15 the birthing process. Sections 2-6 of this bill make conforming changes relating to
16 the applicability and enforcement of section 1.
17 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover doula services provided by a doula
18 who enrolls with the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
19 Department of Health and Human Services. (NRS 422.27177) Sections 18, 43, 46,
20 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56 and 61 of this bill require various other public and private
21 insurers who cover maternity care to: (1) cover doula services; and (2) include
22 doulas in their networks of providers. Section 45 of this bill authorizes the
23 Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by
24 a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage
25 required by section 43. Section 60 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to
26 suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to
27 provide the coverage required by section 55. The Commissioner is also authorized
28 to take such action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage
29 required by sections 43, 46, 48, 50, 51, 53 and 61. (NRS 680A.200)
30 Existing law requires certain health insurers, including Medicaid managed care
31 organizations and insurance for state and local governmental employees, to cover
32 hormone replacement therapy to varying degrees. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
33 689A.0415, 689B.0376, 689C.1678, 695A.1875, 695B.1916, 695C.050,
34 695C.1694, 695G.1717) Sections 44, 47, 49, 52, 54, 58 and 64 of this bill require
35 such coverage to include coverage of testosterone replacement therapy for
36 menopausal women. Section 67.5 of this bill requires: (1) private insurers to submit
37 to the Commissioner a plan for complying with that requirement on or before
38 January 1, 2026; and (2) the Commissioner to evaluate those plans and post a
39 bulletin on or before February 1, 2026, stating whether each such insurer is likely to
40 be in compliance with that requirement. Section 42 of this bill prohibits certain
41 health insurers from denying a request to include a provider of health care in a
42 provider network because the provider of health care is a solo practitioner.
43 Existing law requires: (1) the board of trustees of each school district and the
44 governing body of each charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
45 pupils to adopt a policy for the prevention and treatment of injuries to the head of a
46 pupil; and (2) the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
47 of each charter school to adopt a policy concerning safe exposure to the sun. (NRS
48 392.452, 392.453) Section 19 of this bill additionally requires the board of trustees
49 of each school district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public
50 schools (currently only the Clark County School District) to adopt a policy
51 concerning the prevention of sudden cardiac arrest during the participation of pupils
52 in competitive sports sponsored by a school.
53 Existing law authorizes a court that finds a child to be in need of protection to
54 place the child in the temporary custody of a public or private agency or institution.
55 (NRS 432B.550) If such a child is placed in the custody of an agency which
56 provides child welfare services and has been diagnosed with a mental or behavioral
57 health condition before or after such placement, section 22 of this bill requires the
58 agency which provides child welfare services to provide for an independent
59 assessment of the child before the child leaves the custody of the agency which
60 provides child welfare services. Section 22 provides that this requirement does not
61 apply if a prior assessment conducted after the initial diagnosis has determined that
62 the child no longer has a mental or behavioral health condition. Sections 7 and 23-
63 25 of this bill make conforming changes to make various provisions governing
64 child welfare proceedings generally applicable to any proceeding related to the
65 provisions of section 22. Section 33.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
-
*SB192_R3*

– 3 –
66 require the State Board of Nursing to establish qualifications for an advanced
67 practice registered nurse to conduct an assessment pursuant to section 22.
68 Existing law provides for the regulation of the practices of medicine, nursing
69 and osteopathic medicine by the Board of Medical Examiners, the State Board of
70 Nursing and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively. (Chapters 630,
71 632 and 633 of NRS) Sections 29, 32 and 35 of this bill: (1) require those boards to
72 adopt regulations prescribing a list of race-based health formulas and race-based
73 care standards that are authorized for use by licensees in this State; (2) prohibit
74 those boards from including on that list any race-based health formula or race-
75 based care standard if there is a race-neutral health formula or race-neutral care
76 standard that has been scientifically validated as being at least as effective for the
77 same purpose; and (3) prohibit a physician, physician assistant, nurse or osteopathic
78 physician from using or authorizing the use of a race-based health formula or race-
79 based care standard that is not included on the list. Section 65 of this bill requires
80 the Board of Medical Examiners, the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, the
81 University of Nevada, Reno, School of Medicine and the University of Nevada, Las
82 Vegas, School of Medicine to study disparities in health care access, the provision
83 of health care and health care outcomes.
