Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Federal regulations require providers of health care and facilities that receive federal
2 funding to provide interpreter services when necessary to ensure meaningful access for a
3 person with limited English proficiency, including a person who primarily communicates
4 using sign language. (45 C.F.R. § 92.201)] Existing federal regulations require providers
5 of health care and health care facilities that receive funding or certain other assistance

Senate Amendment No. 460 to Senate Bill No. 192 Page 4
6 from the Federal Government to ensure that communications with persons with
7 disabilities are as effective as communications with persons who do not have disabilities.
8 (45 C.F.R. § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1) prohibit such providers and facilities
9 from requiring a person with a disability to be accompanied by a person to interpret for
10 him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and facilities to provide qualified
11 interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45 C.F.R. §
12 92.202) Section 1 of this bill requires a hospital or freestanding birthing center to provide a
13 qualified sign language interpreter to a patient who is at the hospital or freestanding birthing
14 center for the purpose of giving birth [.] , except where providing such an interpreter
15 would be impractical or delay necessary care. Section 1 also requires a hospital or
16 freestanding birthing center to allow a family member of the patient and a doula to be present
17 in the room with the patient during the birthing process. Sections 2-6 of this bill make
18 conforming changes relating to the applicability and enforcement of section 1.
19 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover doula services provided by a doula who enrolls
20 with the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and
21 Human Services. (NRS 422.27177) Sections [17,] 18, 43, 46, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 56 and 61 of
22 this bill require various other public and private insurers who cover maternity care to: (1)
23 cover doula services; and (2) include doulas in their networks of providers. Section 45 of this
24 bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance
25 issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage
26 required by section 43. Section 60 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or
27 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
28 required by section 55. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action against other
29 health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections 43, 46, 48, 50, 51, 53
30 and 61. (NRS 680A.200)
31 Existing law requires certain health insurers, including Medicaid managed care
32 organizations and insurance for state and local governmental employees, to cover hormone
33 replacement therapy to varying degrees. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 689A.0415, 689B.0376,
34 689C.1678, 695A.1875, 695B.1916, 695C.050, 695C.1694, 695G.1717) Sections 44, 47, 49,
35 52, 54, 58 and 64 of this bill require such coverage to include coverage of testosterone
36 replacement therapy for menopausal women. [Section 20 of this bill requires Medicaid,
37 including where benefits are not provided through managed care, to cover hormone therapy,
38 including testosterone replacement therapy for menopausal women. Section 16 of this bill
39 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to administer the
40 provisions of section 20 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section
41 21 of this bill expands existing coverage of dental services under Medicaid. (NRS
42 422.272422)] Section 67.5 of this bill requires: (1) those insurers to submit to the
43 Commissioner a plan for complying with that requirement on or before January 1, 2026;
44 and (2) the Commissioner to evaluate those plans and post a bulletin on or before
45 February 1, 2026, stating whether each such insurer is likely to be in compliance with
46 that requirement. Section 42 of this bill prohibits certain health insurers from denying a
47 request to include a provider of health care in a provider network because the provider of
48 health care is a solo practitioner.
49 Existing law requires: (1) the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
50 body of each charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils to adopt a policy
51 for the prevention and treatment of injuries to the head of a pupil; and (2) the board of trustees
52 of each school district and the governing body of each charter school to adopt a policy
53 concerning safe exposure to the sun. (NRS 392.452, 392.453) Section 19 of this bill
54 additionally requires the board of trustees of each school district [and the governing body of
55 each charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils] which has more than
56 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently only the Clark County School
57 District) to adopt a policy concerning the prevention of sudden cardiac arrest during the
58 participation of pupils in competitive sports sponsored by a school.
59 Existing law authorizes a court that finds a child to be in need of protection to [: (1)
60 permit the child to remain in the custody of his or her parent or guardian; (2) place the child in
61 the custody of a relative, a fictive kin or another suitable person; or (3)] place the child in the
62 temporary custody of a public or private agency or institution. (NRS 432B.550) If such a child
63 is placed [other than with a parent] in the custody of an agency which provides child
64 welfare services and has been diagnosed with a mental or behavioral health condition before

Senate Amendment No. 460 to Senate Bill No. 192 Page 5
65 or after such placement, section 22 of this bill requires the agency which provides child
66 welfare services to provide for an independent [psychiatric evaluation] assessment of the
67 child [not more than 6 months] before the child [achieves a permanent placement or
68 transitions to independent living.] leaves the custody of the agency which provides child
69 welfare services. Section 22 provides that this requirement does not apply if a prior
70 [psychiatric evaluation] assessment conducted after the initial diagnosis has determined that
71 the child no longer has a mental or behavioral health condition. Sections 7 and 23-25 of this
72 bill make conforming changes to make various provisions governing child welfare
73 proceedings generally applicable to any proceeding related to the provisions of section 22.
74 Section 33.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the State Board of
75 Nursing to establish qualifications for an advanced practice registered nurse to conduct
76 an assessment pursuant to section 22.
77 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices. (NRS 598A.060) [Section 26 of this
78 bill prohibits a health carrier or a health insurance administrator from: (1) providing health
79 care services directly to patients; or (2) operating or administering any entity that provides
80 health care services directly to patients.] Existing law requires the notification of the
81 Attorney General not later than 30 days before the consummation of certain mergers,
82 acquisitions or other transactions involving health carriers or group practices of certain
83 practitioners. (NRS 598A.290-598A.430) Sections 26.1, 26.2, 26.5-26.7 and 26.85 of this
84 bill broaden the applicability of that requirement to also include: (1) such transactions
85 involving health care facilities, private providers of emergency medical services and
86 group practices of certain additional practitioners; and (2) certain additional
87 transactions. Sections 26.8 and 26.85 of this bill require the notice to be provided to the
88 Attorney General not later than 60 days, rather than 30 days, before the consummation
89 of the transaction. Section 26.3 of this bill requires the Attorney General, after receiving
90 such notice, to: (1) post certain information concerning the transaction on an Internet
91 website maintained by the Attorney General; and (2) hold a public hearing to allow for
92 comment on the transaction from interested persons and the public. Section 26.9 of this
93 bill makes a conforming change to exempt information that section 26.3 requires the
94 Attorney General to post on the Internet from requirements governing the
95 confidentiality of information concerning reportable transactions. Section 26.3
96 authorizes the Attorney General to require any entity involved in a reportable
97 transaction to submit a report that contains certain additional information about the
98 transaction. Section 26.3 requires the Attorney General to review and approve, deny or
99 impose conditions on the transaction. Section 26.35 of this bill makes consummating a
100 reportable transaction without the approval of the Attorney General or in violation of
101 any condition imposed by the Attorney General an unfair trade practice. The Attorney
102 General [or a person injured by a violation of section 26] would be authorized to bring a civil
103 action against a health carrier or health insurance administrator who violates that prohibition.
104 (NRS 598A.160, 598A.180-598A.210) Additionally, [a health carrier or health insurance
105 administrator] any person or entity who commits such a violation would be subject to
106 criminal and civil penalties. (NRS 598A.170, 598A.280) [Sections 8-15 of this bill authorize
107 the Attorney General to use money from certain fees which are currently used to support
108 investigations of unfair trade practices for the purpose of investigating violations of section
109 26. Sections 38-41, 57, 59, 62 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes to remove
110 references to the direct provision of health care by health insurers.
111 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the covenant: (1) is
112 supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any restraint that is greater than is
113 required for the protection of the employer; (3) does not impose an undue hardship on the
114 employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that are appropriately related to the consideration for
115 the covenant. (NRS 613.195) Section 27 of this bill prohibits a hospital from entering into a
116 noncompetition covenant with a provider of health care if the covenant prohibits the provider
117 of health care from providing medical services at another medical facility or office during or
118 after the term of the employment or contract, as applicable. Section 27 provides that any
119 provision of a noncompetition covenant that violates that prohibition is void. Additionally, the
120 provisions of section 27 would be subject to administrative enforcement by the Labor
121 Commissioner. (NRS 607.160)] Section 26.95 of this bill: (1) authorizes the imposition of a
122 civil penalty for a willful violation of sections 26.1-26.3; and (2) provides that a violation
123 of sections 26.1-26.3 or the consummation of a reportable transaction in violation of

Senate Amendment No. 460 to Senate Bill No. 192 Page 6
124 section 26.35 does not give rise to a private cause of action. Section 26.4 of this bill makes
125 a conforming change to indicate the applicability of certain definitions.
126 Existing law provides for the regulation of the practices of medicine, nursing and
127 osteopathic medicine by the Board of Medical Examiners, the State Board of Nursing and the
128 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively. (Chapters 630, 632 and 633 of NRS)
129 Sections 29, 32 and 35 of this bill: (1) require those boards to adopt regulations prescribing a
130 list of race-based health formulas and race-based care standards that are authorized for use by
131 licensees in this State; (2) prohibit those boards from including on that list any race-based
132 health formula or race-based care standard if there is a race-neutral health formula or race-
133 neutral care standard that has been scientifically validated as being at least as effective for the
134 same purpose; and (3) prohibit a physician, physician assistant, nurse or osteopathic physician
135 from using or authorizing the use of a race-based health formula or race-based care standard
136 that is not included on the list. Section 65 of this bill requires the Board of Medical
137 Examiners, the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, the University of Nevada, Reno, School
138 of Medicine and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, School of Medicine to study disparities
139 in health care access, the provision of health care and health care outcomes.
140 Sections 30, 33 and 36 of this bill require a physician, physician assistant, advanced
141 practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician to: (1) discuss with a patient, upon
142 diagnosing the patient with arthritis, osteoarthritis or any other condition that is commonly
143 treated using stem cell therapy, the potential use of stem cell therapy to treat the condition;
144 and (2) when acting as a provider of primary care, inform a patient of options that may be
145 available to the patient for donating, banking or storing stem cells for future use by the patient
146 or a donee during the first encounter with the patient.
147 [Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the prescribing or dispensing of a
148 controlled substance listed in schedule II, III or IV for the treatment of pain. (NRS 639.2391-
149 639.23914) Section 37 of this bill clarifies that those requirements do not: (1) apply to the
150 prescribing or dispensing of a controlled substance in other circumstances; or (2) establish a
151 standard of care or grounds for disciplinary action against a practitioner when a controlled
152 substance is prescribed or dispensed in other circumstances.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 449 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. A hospital or freestanding birthing center shall:

7 or freestanding birthing center; and
8 (b) Upon the request of such a patient or his or her representative, provide
9 the patient with a qualified sign language interpreter until the patient is
10 discharged from the hospital or freestanding birthing center [.] , unless providing
11 an interpreter would be impractical under the circumstances or delay necessary
12 care for the patient.
13 2. At the request of a patient who is giving birth, a hospital or freestanding
14 birthing center shall allow a family member of the patient and a doula to be
15 present in the room with the patient during the birthing process so long as the
16 family member and doula comply with the policies of the hospital or freestanding
17 birthing center, as applicable.

16 denomination for the purpose of providing facilities for the care and treatment of
17 the sick who depend solely upon spiritual means through prayer for healing in the

26 Sec. 7. NRS 49.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
