3 and make technical corrections relating to the administration of trusts and estates.

-
*SB404_R1*

– 2 –
7 this bill: (1) revises the order of priority for the appointment of an administrator to
8 administrate the intestate estate of a decedent; (2) provides that a person may be
9 legally qualified to serve as an administrator upon a finding of good cause based on
10 certain evidence; and (3) authorizes the court to appoint certain persons under
11 certain circumstances. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to an
12 internal reference caused by the revisions relating to the order of priority and
13 appointment in section 1.2. Section 1.4 of this bill authorizes a court to appoint one
14 or more persons or an independent personal representative under certain
15 circumstances.
16 Existing law establishes the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which
17 allows a personal representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a
18 decedent without court supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill
19 provides that only a personal representative who is named in the will or certain
20 other persons who meet the criteria to be legally qualified as an administrator of an
21 intestate estate may administer an estate. Existing law authorizes any interested
22 person to petition for modification or revocation of the authority of a personal
23 representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill requires the court, when
24 determining whether to revoke the authority of a personal representative, to give
25 preference to any interested person based on the order of priority set forth for the
26 appointment of an administrator for an intestate estate.
27 Under existing law, a court is authorized to enter an order for the summary
28 administration of an estate if the court deems summary administration advisable
29 and the gross value of the estate does not exceed $300,000, after deducting any
30 encumbrances. (NRS 145.040) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill increase that amount to
31 $500,000.
32 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill increase the monetary amount for an estate to be
33 set aside without administration from $100,000 to $150,000. Section 10 of this bill
34 makes a conforming change to similarly increase the affidavit of entitlement limit
35 for a surviving spouse.
36 Existing law requires certain civil actions to recover damages from another
37 person to be commenced within certain periods. (NRS 11.190) Section 12 of this
38 bill provides that an action against certain persons based on a breach of fiduciary
39 duty, not involving fraud or intentional misrepresentation, must be commenced
40 within 2 years.
41 Existing law exempts certain property from a writ of execution to enforce a
42 judgment, including certain property known as a homestead. (NRS 21.090) Section
43 13 of this bill removes the monetary dollar amounts relating to a homestead from
44 NRS 21.090 and instead refers to the amount of the value of such exemptions set
45 forth in chapter 115 of NRS.
46 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing durable powers of attorney
47 for health care decisions, including a form to create an advance health-care
48 directive. (NRS 162A.700-162A.870) Section 14 of this bill establishes an
49 alternative form to create an advance health-care directive. Sections 15, 16 and 24-
50 30 of this bill make conforming changes to reference the alternative form.
51 Section 18 of this bill authorizes a trustee to make an outright distribution to a
52 beneficiary without requiring the trustee to first create a new trust under certain
53 circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that
54 certain terms apply to the outright distribution.
55 Section 20 of this bill grants a trustee the power to reimburse a settlor for tax
56 payments. Section 21 of this bill requires certain documentation to be provided to
57 beneficiaries of a trust. Section 22 of this bill specifies the circumstances under
58 which the laws of this State govern the administration of a trust. Section 23 of this
59 bill provides for the circumstances under which an account must be deemed
60 approved and final by a trust adviser or trust protector.

61 Section 32 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which set forth a
62 preference for relatives of the whole blood over relatives of the half blood for
63 certain purposes relating to the administration of an estate.

10 minor or an incapacitated person for whom a guardian has been
11 appointed, the court may appoint the guardian of the minor or
12 incapacitated person as administrator.]

14 discretion:
15 (a) Disregard the order of priority set forth in subsection 1 to

20 and the value thereof that is subject to probate administration,
21 including, without limitation, requiring the personal representative

40 administration. The court may, if deemed advisable considering the
41 nature, character and obligations of the estate, provide in its order
42 revoking summary administration that regular administration of the

1 Sec. 8. NRS 146.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 146.020 1. The court, on its own motion or upon petition by
3 an interested person, may, if deemed advisable considering the
4 needs and resources of the surviving spouse, minor child or minor
5 children, set apart for the use of the surviving spouse, minor child or
6 minor children of the decedent all of the personal property which is
7 exempt by law from execution, and shall, in accordance with NRS
8 146.050, set apart the homestead, as designated by the general
9 homestead law then in force, whether the homestead has theretofore
10 previously been selected as required by law or not, and the property
11 thus set apart is not subject to administration.
12 2. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1,
13 the remaining assets of the estate do not exceed [$100,000]
14 $150,000 and may be set aside without administration pursuant to
15 NRS 146.070, the court shall set aside the remaining assets of the
16 estate without administration pursuant to the procedure set forth in
17 NRS 146.070. The court may consider at the same time a petition
18 made pursuant to subsection 1 and a petition to set aside the
19 remaining assets of the estate without administration pursuant to
20 NRS 146.070.
21 3. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1,
22 the remaining assets of the estate exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and
23 may not be set aside without administration pursuant to NRS
24 146.070, the court shall administer the remaining assets of the estate
25 pursuant to this title as if the remaining assets of the estate are the
26 only assets of the estate. If the petition to set apart property pursuant
27 to subsection 1 is made in the initial petition, the court shall consider
28 only the value of the remaining assets of the estate not set apart
29 pursuant to subsection 1 for the purpose of ordering summary
30 administration pursuant to chapter 145 of NRS.
31 Sec. 9. NRS 146.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 146.070 1. All or part of the estate of a decedent may be set
33 aside without administration by the order of the court as follows:
34 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed
35 [$100,000,] $150,000, the estate may be set aside without
36 administration by the order of the court; or
37 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s
38 estate is to be distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust
39 established by the decedent and in existence at the decedent’s death,
40 the portion of the estate subject to such direction may be set aside
41 without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s estate set aside
42 to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
43 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the
44 court that the trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to
-
*SB404_R1*

– 10 –
1 such creditors on behalf of the nontestamentary trust and settlor
2 pursuant to NRS 164.025.
3 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the whole
4 estate set aside pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 must be
5 assigned and set apart in the following order:
6 (a) To the payment of the petitioner’s attorney’s fees and costs
7 incurred relative to the proceeding under this section;
8 (b) To the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of last illness,
9 money owed to the Department of Health and Human Services as a
10 result of payment of benefits for Medicaid and creditors, if there are
11 any;
12 (c) To the payment of other creditors, if any; and
13 (d) Any balance remaining to the claimant or claimants entitled
14 thereto pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no
15 valid will, pursuant to intestate succession in accordance with
16 chapter 134 of NRS.
17 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed [$100,000]
18 $150,000 and the decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more
19 minor children, the court must set aside the estate for the benefit of
20 the surviving spouse or the minor child or minor children of the
21 decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or
22 5. The court may allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse,
23 the entire amount to the minor child or minor children, or may
24 divide the estate among the surviving spouse and minor child or
25 minor children.
26 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the
27 surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the decedent
28 pursuant to subsection 3, the court must set aside the estate without
29 the payment of creditors except as the court finds necessary to
30 prevent a manifest injustice.
31 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are
32 nonprobate transfers that already benefit the surviving spouse or
33 minor child or minor children of the decedent, the court has the
34 discretion to reduce the amount set aside under subsection 3 to the
35 extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value of
36 nonprobate transfers, as defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent
37 to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
38 children of the decedent exceeds [$100,000.] $150,000.
39 6. In exercising the discretion granted in this section, the court
40 shall consider the needs and resources of the surviving spouse and
41 minor child or minor children, including any assets received by or
42 for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor

35
36 Name: ...........................................................................

28 By this document I intend to create a durable power of
29 attorney by appointing the person designated above to make
30 health care decisions for me. This power of attorney shall
31 not be affected by my subsequent incapacity. My goal is to
32 reduce the intervention of a court in my affairs by allowing
33 for care without the need for guardianship.
34
35 By signing this document, I revoke any prior durable
36 power of attorney for health care that I may have made.
37
38 If my designated agent is my spouse or is one of my
39 children, then I waive any conflict of interest in carrying
40 out the provisions of this Durable Power of Attorney for
41 Health Care that said spouse or child may have by reason of
42 the fact that he or she may be a beneficiary of my estate.

1 4. GENERAL STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY
2 GRANTED
3
4 In the event that I am incapable of giving informed
5 consent with respect to health care decisions, I hereby grant
6 to the agent named above full power and authority to make
7 health care decisions for me before or after my death,
8 including consent, refusal of consent or withdrawal of
9 consent to any care, treatment, service or procedure to
10 maintain, diagnose or treat a physical or mental condition;
11 to request, review and receive any information, verbal or
12 written, regarding my physical or mental health, including,
13 without limitation, medical and hospital records; to execute
14 on my behalf any releases or other documents that may be
15 required to obtain medical care and/or medical and hospital
16 records, EXCEPT any power to enter into any arbitration
17 agreements or execute any arbitration clauses in connection
18 with admission to any health care facility, including any
19 skilled nursing facility; and subject only to the limitations
20 and special provisions, if any, set forth below.
21
22 PART 2: HEALTH CARE INSTRUCTION
23
24 This part lets you state your limitations and priorities for
25 health care and the types of health care you do or do not
26 want.
27
28 I give my agent the power to make all health care decisions
29 for me if I cannot make those decisions for myself, except
30 for the following: ............................................ or as set forth
31 below.
32
33 INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT LIFE-SUSTAINING
34 TREATMENT. This section gives you the opportunity to say
35 how you want your agent to act while making decisions for
36 you. You may mark or initial each item or leave any item
37 blank.
38
39 Prolonging life vs. dying a natural death
40
41 1. ( ) I desire that my life be prolonged to the greatest
42 extent possible without regard to my condition, the
43 chances I have for recovery or long-term survival, or
44 the cost of the procedures. In other words, keep my
45 body alive even if my doctors have reasonably
-
*SB404_R1*

– 29 –
1 concluded that there is no reasonable hope for long-
2 term recovery or survival or that my coma (if I am in
3 one) is irreversible. If you select this choice, do not
4 initial choices 2, 3, 4 or 5, as those are inconsistent
5 with this choice.
6
7 2. ( ) If I am in a coma which my doctors have
8 reasonably concluded is irreversible, I desire that life-
9 sustaining or prolonging treatments not be used.
10
11 3. ( ) If I have an incurable or terminal condition or
12 illness and no reasonable hope of long-term recovery
13 or survival, I desire that life-sustaining or prolonging
14 treatments not be used.
15
16 4. ( ) I have reviewed the Nevada POLST form
17 (sample attached hereto as Exhibit 1). If in the future
18 I have not executed a POLST form and my physician
19 determines, or my agent suspects, that execution of a
20 POLST is appropriate, then my agent is authorized to
21 execute a POLST on my behalf in accordance with
22 my wishes stated in this, my Durable Power of
23 Attorney for Health Care.
24
25 GI feeding tube or IV. I understand that withholding or
26 withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration may result
27 in death by starvation or dehydration. For some people this
28 may be a tenet of their religion. For some people it may not
29 make sense to continue this when all other treatment
30 (machines) is terminated.
31
32 5. ( ) I do not want continued artificial nutrition and
33 hydration (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or
34 intravenous liquids) after all other treatment is
35 terminated.
36
37 6. ( ) I do want continued artificial nutrition and
38 hydration (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or
39 intravenous liquids) after all other treatment is
40 terminated. If I initial this section, you are asked to
41 continue to give me the artificial nutrition and
42 hydration.
43
44 7. ( ) I understand that continued artificial nutrition
45 and hydration (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or
-
*SB404_R1*

– 30 –
1 intravenous liquids) will likely occur if my physician
2 reasonably believes that providing such will lead to
3 my recovery. However, I do not want to continue to
4 receive artificial nutrition and hydration if it is
5 expected to continue for the rest of my life.
6
7 Experimental procedures, treatments and drugs. I
8 understand that it can take a long time to obtain FDA
9 approval for new medical procedures, treatments and drugs.
10 As a result, many are categorized as “experimental.” I also
11 understand that some of such procedures, treatments or
12 drugs have a good record of success and that some contain
13 risks. I also understand that experimental procedures,
14 treatments and drugs can only be given to me if I authorize
15 them.
16
17 8. ( ) I authorize my agent to enroll me in
18 experimental procedures or treatments if said
19 procedures or treatments are recommended by my
20 physician and my agent consents. My agent is to
21 consider the relief of suffering, the preservation or
22 restoration of functioning, and the quality as well as
23 the extent of the possible extension of my life in
24 making that decision. My agent is to consider whether
25 the expected benefits outweigh the burdens of the
26 treatment or drug.
27
28 9. ( ) I do not want any experimental procedures,
29 treatments or drugs.
30
31 Palliative care (Dying with dignity/Use of pain relieving
32 drugs)
33
34 10. ( ) When I die, I wish to do so with dignity and
35 grace and without pain and suffering. If I have an
36 incurable or terminal condition, including but not
37 limited to late stage dementia, and no reasonable
38 hope of long-term recovery or survival, I desire my
39 attending physician to administer any medication to
40 alleviate suffering without regard to the fact that the
41 medication may be addictive or may reduce the
42 extension of my life.
43
44 11. ( ) I do not wish to have any medication that may
45 be addictive or reduce the extension of my life.
-
*SB404_R1*

– 31 –
1 Assisted living or other facility
2
3 12. ( ) I desire to live in my home for as long as it is
4 safe and my medical needs can be met. My agent may
5 arrange for a natural person, employee of an agency
6 or provider of community-based services to come into
7 my home to provide care for me. When it is no longer
8 safe for me to live in my home, I authorize my agent
9 to place me in a facility or home that can provide any
10 medical assistance and support in my activities of
11 daily living that I require. Before being placed in
12 such a facility or home, I wish for my agent to discuss
13 and share information concerning the placement with
14 me, and allow me to participate in the choice of said
15 facility or home. If I am married, placement shall be
16 done in a manner that considers my spouse’s support
17 needs.
18
19 13. ( ) I refuse to be placed in any assisted living or
20 other care facility. I understand that, before I may be
21 placed in a facility or home other than the home in
22 which I currently reside, a guardian must be
23 appointed for me, which means that a court action
24 would be needed to remove me from my home.
25
26 ( ) Other (write what you want or do not want):

29 INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT PRIORITIES
30
31 You can use this section to provide any other information
32 about your goals, values and preferences for treatment,
33 including care you want or do not want. To the extent that
34 you make entries in this section, this information is for your
35 agent and is not intended to limit or impair the physician’s
36 determination of a course of treatment, nor to subject the
37 physician to legal claims. You can also use this section to
38 name anyone whom you do not want to make decisions for
39 you under any conditions. (Insert such priorities, if any.)

1 PART 3: OPTIONAL SPECIAL POWERS AND
2 GUIDANCE
3
4 This part allows you to give your agent additional powers
5 and to provide your agent with more guidance about your
6 wishes. You may mark or initial each item. You also may
7 leave any item blank.
8
9 Mental health care or cognitive rehabilitation
10
11 14. ( ) I authorize my agent to admit me as a
12 voluntary patient to a facility for mental health or
13 place me in rehabilitative care if my agent determines
14 such treatment is best for my health and safety, or if it
15 is recommended by a physician.
16
17 15. ( ) I do not authorize my agent to admit me as a
18 voluntary patient to a facility for mental health or
19 place me in rehabilitative care even if my agent
20 determines such treatment is best for my health and
21 safety, or even if it is recommended by a physician.
22
23 ACCESS TO MY HEALTH INFORMATION (HIPAA).
24 I give my agent permission to examine and share
25 information about my health needs and health care if I am
26 not able to make decisions for myself. By signing this form,
27 I give the authorization and full release of information by
28 any government agency, medical provider, business,
29 creditor or third party who may have information pertaining
30 to my health care to my agent named herein, pursuant to
31 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
32 1996, Public Law 104-191, as amended, and applicable
33 regulations.
34
35 GUIDANCE FOR MY AGENT. The instructions I have
36 stated in this document should guide my agent in making
37 decisions for me. (Initial or mark one of the items below to
38 tell your agent more about how to use these instructions.):
39
40 16. ( ) I give my agent permission to be flexible in
41 applying these instructions if he or she thinks it
42 would be in my best interest based on what they know
43 about me and the recommendations of the attending
44 physician.
-
*SB404_R1*

– 33 –
1 17. ( ) I want my agent to follow these instructions
2 exactly as written if possible, even if he or she thinks
3 something else is better.
4
5 GOOD FAITH CARE. My wish is that the provider of
6 health care work cooperatively with me and my agent for
7 my care. To that end, a provider of health care who relies in
8 good faith on the provisions of this advance health-care
9 directive shall be immune from criminal and civil liability
10 applicable to the withholding or withdrawal of life-
11 sustaining treatment. As such, the liability protection
12 provisions already in law in NRS 449A.727 shall apply
13 whether or not this advance health-care directive is
14 retrieved from the Registry established by the Nevada
15 Secretary of State.
16
17 NOMINATION OF GUARDIAN. A guardian is a
18 person appointed by a court to make decisions for someone
19 who cannot make decisions. Filling this out does NOT mean
20 you want or need a guardian right now.
21
22 If a court appoints a guardian to make personal decisions
23 for me, I want the court to choose my agent named in this
24 form. If my agent cannot be a guardian, I want my alternate
25 agent(s) in the order named in this form. If I prefer
26 someone other than the agent(s) named in this form, their
27 name and contact information is: ..........................................
28 ..................................................................................................
29 ..................................................................................................
30
31 AMENDMENT; RIGHT TO TERMINATE. This
32 durable power of attorney may be amended. This document
33 shall not be terminated by anyone other than me and it shall
34 not be terminated by a governmental entity, including a

23 162A.710 As used in NRS 162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive,
24 and section 14 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the
25 words and terms defined in NRS 162A.715 to 162A.780, inclusive,
26 and section 14 of this act have the meanings ascribed to them in
27 those sections.
28 Sec. 17. NRS 162B.510 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 162B.510 1. Appointive property subject to a general power
30 of appointment created by a person other than the powerholder is
31 not subject to a claim of any creditor, unless the power of
32 appointment was held by a decedent who actually exercised the
33 power in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate pursuant to
34 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 12 of NRS 111.779.
35 2. Subject to subsection 3 of NRS 162B.530, a power of
36 appointment created by a person other than the powerholder which
37 is subject to an ascertainable standard relating to an individual’s
38 health, education, support or maintenance within the meaning of 26
39 U.S.C. § 2041(b)(1)(A) or 26 U.S.C. § 2514(c)(1), as those

*SB404_R1*

– 37 –
1 instrument creating a separate trust requires the assets of the
2 separate trust to be distributed to the beneficiary or beneficiaries
3 of the trust immediately after the establishment of the separate
4 trust as a result of the circumstances existing at the time the
5 separate trust is to be established, the executor, trustee or any
6 other party having possession of the property with which the
7 separate trust will be funded may exercise discretion to make a
8 distribution directly to the beneficiary or the beneficiaries of the
9 separate trust.
10 2. An executor, trustee or any other party described in
11 subsection 1 may exercise discretion rather than distributing the
12 trust assets to the trustee of the separate trust if the transferring
13 executor, trustee or any other party described in subsection 1 and
14 the trustee of the separate trust are the same person.
15 3. The receipts of distribution provided to any beneficiary or
16 beneficiaries in the manner described in this section shall be
17 deemed to protect the executor, trustee or other person having
18 possession of the property to the same extent that a receipt of
19 distribution would have protected the executor, trustee or other
20 person had the property been distributed by the trustee from the
21 separate trust.
22 Sec. 19. NRS 163.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:

40 trustee, in the sole discretion of the trustee or at the direction or with
41 the consent of a directing trust adviser, to reimburse a settlor for all
42 or a portion of tax on trust income or principal that is payable by the
43 settlor under the law imposing such tax. In the sole discretion of the
44 trustee, the trustee may pay such amount to the settlor directly or to
45 an appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the settlor.
-
*SB404_R1*

– 38 –
1 2. [A trustee or directing trust adviser] Except as expressly
2 prohibited or otherwise provided under the trust instrument, if all
3 or any portion of the trust is treated as being owned by a person
4 under section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar
5 federal, state or other tax law, in addition to any such discretion
6 conferred under the terms of a trust instrument, the trustee may,
7 in the trustee’s sole discretion, reimburse the person being treated
8 as the owner for any amount of the person’s federal, state or other
9 income tax liability that is attributable to the inclusion of the
10 trust’s income, capital gains, deductions or credits in the
11 calculation of the person’s taxable income. In the trustee’s sole
12 discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement amount,
13 determined without regard to any other distribution or payment
14 made from trust assets, to the person directly or to the appropriate
15 taxing authority. A life insurance policy held in the trust, the cash
16 value of any such policy or the proceeds of any loan secured by an
17 interest in the policy may not be used for such reimbursement or
18 payment if the person is an insured.
19 3. Except as otherwise provided under the trust instrument, a
20 trustee who exercises discretion to make, consent to or direct the
21 decision to reimburse the settlor under subsection 1 or 2 is not
22 liable to any person in exercising such discretion to reimburse or not
23 reimburse a settlor for tax payable by the settlor on trust income or
24 principal pursuant to subsection 1.
25 [3.] 4. A trustee may not exercise or participate in the
26 exercise of the powers granted by this section with respect to any

28 (a) Treated as the owner of all or part of the trust under
29 section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal,
30 state or other tax law;
31 (b) A beneficiary of the trust; or

35 under section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar
36 federal, state or other tax law; or
37 (2) A beneficiary of the trust.
38 5. If the trust instrument requires the trustee to act at the
39 direction or with the consent of a trust adviser, trust protector or
40 any other person, or that the reimbursement decisions permitted
41 by this section be made directly by a trust adviser, trust protector
42 or any other person, the powers granted by subsection 1 and the
43 provisions of subsection 2 applicable to the trustee are instead also
44 granted or apply, subject to the trust instrument, to the trust
45 adviser, trust protector or other person subject to the limitations
-
*SB404_R1*

– 39 –
1 set forth in subsection 3, which must be applied as if the trust
2 adviser, trust protector or other person were a trustee.
3 6. The power of a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any
4 other person to make a payment to or for the benefit of a settlor or
5 other person in accordance with subsection 1 or 2 or the decision of
6 a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any other person to
7 exercise such power in favor of the settlor must not cause the settlor
8 or other person to be treated as a beneficiary for purposes of the
9 laws of this State [.] solely by reason of the application of this
10 section. As used in this subsection, “beneficiary” has the meaning
11 ascribed to it in NRS 163.4147.
12 7. This section applies to all trusts described in subsection 2
13 that are governed by the laws of this State or have a principal
14 place of administration within this State whether created before,

16 (a) At least 60 days before the effective date of such election,
17 the trustee provides written notice that the trustee intends to
18 irrevocably elect out of the application of this section to:
19 (1) The person treated as the owner of all or a portion of
20 the trust under section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any
21 similar federal, state or other tax law; and
22 (2) All persons who have the ability to remove and replace
23 the trustee under the terms of the trust instrument.
24 (b) Applying the discretion conferred under subsection 1 will
25 prevent a contribution to the trust from qualifying for or reducing
26 a federal tax benefit, including a federal tax exclusion or
27 deduction, that was originally claimed or could have been claimed
28 for the contribution, including:
29 (1) An exclusion under section 2503(b) or 2503(c) of the
30 Internal Revenue Code;
31 (2) A marital deduction under section 2056, 2056A or 2523

37 Sec. 21. NRS 164.021 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 164.021 1. When a revocable trust becomes irrevocable
39 because of the death of a settlor or by the express terms of the trust,
40 the trustee may, after the trust becomes irrevocable, provide notice

11 expressly provided by the trust instrument . [; and]
12 (e) A statement set forth in a separate paragraph, in 12-point

16 3. The trustee shall cause notice pursuant to this section to be
17 provided in accordance with the provisions of NRS 155.010.
18 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person
19 upon whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may bring an
20 action to contest the validity of the trust more than 120 days from
21 the date the notice is served upon the person, unless the person
22 proves that he or she did not receive actual notice. A person upon
23 whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may provide
24 consent in writing to a period of less than 120 days in which the
25 person may bring an action to contest the validity of the trust.
26 5. [For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection 2, a copy of
27 the trust instrument shall be considered complete if it includes all
28 amendments and restatements to the trust instrument the trustee has
29 determined to be in effect at the time of the death of the settlor after
30 the trustee has exercised due diligence.
31 6.] A trustee is not liable in providing information pursuant to
32 paragraph (c) of subsection 2 to any person whom the trustee has
33 determined, after the exercise of due diligence, to be a beneficiary,
34 heir or interested person.
35 6. A person may waive the right to notice contemplated by
36 this section by delivering to the trustee a waiver signed by the
37 person, which shall be deemed irrevocable. Upon delivery of such
38 a waiver to the trustee, the person who waived the right to notice is
39 precluded from bringing any action to contest the validity of the
40 trust.
41 Sec. 22. NRS 164.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 164.045 1. The laws of this State govern the validity and

24 that govern the administration of the trust, at the time the

27 governing instrument of a trust, such as a provision in the
28 governing instrument to the effect that the laws of a jurisdiction
29 other than this State govern the trust or the administration of the
30 trust, the laws of this State govern the administration of the trust
31 while the trust is administered in this State, as provided in
32 subsection 7 or as otherwise provided, unless:
33 (a) The governing instrument expressly provides that the laws
34 of another jurisdiction govern the administration of the trust and

43 liability under the governing instrument for the action or inaction
44 must be determined in accordance with the laws of the foreign
45 jurisdiction.

39 NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER
40 PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
41
42 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance
43 directive to provide consent or refuse to consent to future
44 psychiatric care if the person later becomes incapable of
45 making or communicating those decisions. By executing a
-
*SB404_R1*

– 47 –
1 durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
2 162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive, and section 14 of this act,
3 the person may also appoint an agent to make decisions
4 regarding psychiatric care for the person when incapable. A
5 person is “incapable” for the purposes of this advance
6 directive when in the opinion of two providers of health care,
7 one of whom must be a physician or licensed psychologist
8 and the other of whom must be a physician, a physician
9 assistant, a licensed psychologist, a psychiatrist or an
10 advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric
11 training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
12 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person currently lacks
13 sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate
14 decisions regarding psychiatric care. If a person is determined
15 to be incapable, the person may be found capable when, in
16 the opinion of the person’s attending physician or an
17 advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric
18 training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
19 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120 and has an established
20 relationship with the person, the person has regained
21 sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate
22 decisions regarding psychiatric care. This document becomes
23 effective upon its proper execution and remains valid for a
24 period of 2 years after the date of its execution unless
25 revoked. Upon being presented with this advance directive,
26 the physician or other provider of health care must make it a
27 part of the person’s medical record. The physician or other
28 provider must act in accordance with the statements
29 expressed in the advance directive when the person is
30 determined to be incapable, except as otherwise provided in
31 NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider shall
32 promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the agent of
33 the principal, and document in the principal’s medical record
34 any act or omission that is not in compliance with any part of
35 an advance directive. A physician or other provider may rely
36 upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated and notarized
37 advance directive.

39 ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR PSYCHIATRIC CARE
40
41 I, .............................., being an adult of sound mind or an

2 assistant, a licensed psychologist, a psychiatrist or an
3 advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric
4 training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
5 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive
6 and evaluate information effectively or communicate
7 decisions is impaired to such an extent that I lack the capacity
8 to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I understand that
9 psychiatric care may not be administered without my express
10 and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my
11 informed consent, the express and informed consent of my
12 legally responsible person, my agent named pursuant to a
13 valid durable power of attorney for health care or my consent
14 expressed in this advance directive for psychiatric care. I
15 understand that I may become incapable of giving or
16 withholding informed consent or refusal for psychiatric care
17 due to the symptoms of a diagnosed mental disorder. These
18 symptoms may include:
