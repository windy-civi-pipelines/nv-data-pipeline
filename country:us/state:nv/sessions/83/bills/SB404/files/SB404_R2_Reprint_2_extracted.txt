Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the administration of trusts and estates. (Titles 12 and 13
2 of NRS) Sections 1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 4, 5, 11 and 17 of this bill revise certain terms
3 and make technical corrections relating to the administration of trusts and estates.
4 Existing law sets forth an order of priority for the appointment of an
5 administrator to administrate the intestate estate of a decedent and authorizes any
6 person legally qualified to serve as the administrator. (NRS 139.040) Section 1.2 of
7 this bill: (1) revises the order of priority for the appointment of an administrator to
8 administrate the intestate estate of a decedent; (2) provides that a person may be
-
*SB404_R2*
– 2 –
9 legally qualified to serve as an administrator upon a finding of good cause based on
10 certain evidence; and (3) authorizes the court to appoint certain persons under
11 certain circumstances. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to an
12 internal reference caused by the revisions relating to the order of priority and
13 appointment in section 1.2. Section 1.4 of this bill authorizes a court to appoint one
14 or more persons to serve as personal representative or appoint an independent
15 representative under certain circumstances.
16 Existing law establishes the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which
17 allows a personal representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a
18 decedent without court supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill
19 provides that only a personal representative who is named in the will or certain
20 other persons who meet the criteria to be legally qualified as an administrator of an
21 intestate estate may administer an estate. Existing law authorizes any interested
22 person to petition for modification or revocation of the authority of a personal
23 representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill requires the court, when
24 determining whether to revoke the authority of a personal representative, to give
25 preference to any interested person based on the order of priority set forth for the
26 appointment of an administrator for an intestate estate.
27 Under existing law, a court is authorized to enter an order for the summary
28 administration of an estate if the court deems summary administration advisable
29 and the gross value of the estate does not exceed $300,000, after deducting any
30 encumbrances. (NRS 145.040) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill increase that amount to
31 $500,000.
32 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill increase the monetary amount for an estate to be
33 set aside without administration from $100,000 to $150,000. Section 10 of this bill
34 makes a conforming change to similarly increase the affidavit of entitlement limit
35 for a surviving spouse.
36 Existing law requires certain civil actions to recover damages from another
37 person to be commenced within certain periods. (NRS 11.190) Section 12 of this
38 bill provides that an action against certain persons based on a breach of fiduciary
39 duty, not involving fraud or intentional misrepresentation, must be commenced
40 within 2 years.
41 Section 18 of this bill authorizes a trustee to make an outright distribution to a
42 beneficiary without requiring the trustee to first create a new trust under certain
43 circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that
44 certain terms apply to the outright distribution.
45 Section 20 of this bill grants a trustee the power to reimburse a settlor for tax
46 payments. Section 21 of this bill requires certain documentation to be provided to
47 beneficiaries of a trust. Section 22 of this bill specifies the circumstances under
48 which the laws of this State govern the administration of a trust. Section 23 of this
49 bill provides for the circumstances under which an account must be deemed
50 approved and final by a trust adviser or trust protector.
51 Section 32 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which set forth a
52 preference for relatives of the whole blood over relatives of the half blood for
53 certain purposes relating to the administration of an estate.

15 and the value thereof that is subject to probate administration,
16 including, without limitation, requiring the personal representative

23 Sec. 6. NRS 145.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 145.040 If it is made to appear to the court that the gross value
25 of the estate, after deducting any encumbrances, does not exceed
26 [$300,000,] $500,000, the court may, if deemed advisable
27 considering the nature, character and obligations of the estate, enter
28 an order for a summary administration of the estate.
29 Sec. 7. NRS 145.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:

31 summary administration of an estate it appears that the gross value
32 of the estate, after deducting any encumbrances, exceeds [$300,000]
33 $500,000 as of the death of the decedent, the personal representative
34 shall petition the court for an order revoking summary
35 administration. The court may, if deemed advisable considering the
36 nature, character and obligations of the estate, provide in its order
37 revoking summary administration that regular administration of the
38 estate may proceed unabated upon providing such portions of the
39 regular proceedings and notices as were dispensed with by the order
40 for summary administration.
41 Sec. 8. NRS 146.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 146.020 1. The court, on its own motion or upon petition by
43 an interested person, may, if deemed advisable considering the
44 needs and resources of the surviving spouse, minor child or minor
45 children, set apart for the use of the surviving spouse, minor child or
-
*SB404_R2*
– 9 –
1 minor children of the decedent all of the personal property which is
2 exempt by law from execution, and shall, in accordance with NRS
3 146.050, set apart the homestead, as designated by the general
4 homestead law then in force, whether the homestead has theretofore
5 previously been selected as required by law or not, and the property
6 thus set apart is not subject to administration.
7 2. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1,
8 the remaining assets of the estate do not exceed [$100,000]
9 $150,000 and may be set aside without administration pursuant to
10 NRS 146.070, the court shall set aside the remaining assets of the
11 estate without administration pursuant to the procedure set forth in
12 NRS 146.070. The court may consider at the same time a petition
13 made pursuant to subsection 1 and a petition to set aside the
14 remaining assets of the estate without administration pursuant to
15 NRS 146.070.
16 3. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1,
17 the remaining assets of the estate exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and
18 may not be set aside without administration pursuant to NRS
19 146.070, the court shall administer the remaining assets of the estate
20 pursuant to this title as if the remaining assets of the estate are the
21 only assets of the estate. If the petition to set apart property pursuant
22 to subsection 1 is made in the initial petition, the court shall consider
23 only the value of the remaining assets of the estate not set apart
24 pursuant to subsection 1 for the purpose of ordering summary
25 administration pursuant to chapter 145 of NRS.
26 Sec. 9. NRS 146.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 146.070 1. All or part of the estate of a decedent may be set
28 aside without administration by the order of the court as follows:
29 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed
30 [$100,000,] $150,000, the estate may be set aside without
31 administration by the order of the court; or
32 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s
33 estate is to be distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust
34 established by the decedent and in existence at the decedent’s death,
35 the portion of the estate subject to such direction may be set aside
36 without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s estate set aside
37 to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
38 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the
39 court that the trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to
40 such creditors on behalf of the nontestamentary trust and settlor
41 pursuant to NRS 164.025.
42 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the whole
43 estate set aside pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 must be
44 assigned and set apart in the following order:
-
*SB404_R2*
– 10 –
1 (a) To the payment of the petitioner’s attorney’s fees and costs
2 incurred relative to the proceeding under this section;
3 (b) To the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of last illness,
4 money owed to the Department of Health and Human Services as a
5 result of payment of benefits for Medicaid and creditors, if there are
6 any;
7 (c) To the payment of other creditors, if any; and
8 (d) Any balance remaining to the claimant or claimants entitled
9 thereto pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no
10 valid will, pursuant to intestate succession in accordance with
11 chapter 134 of NRS.
12 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed [$100,000]
13 $150,000 and the decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more
14 minor children, the court must set aside the estate for the benefit of
15 the surviving spouse or the minor child or minor children of the
16 decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or
17 5. The court may allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse,
18 the entire amount to the minor child or minor children, or may
19 divide the estate among the surviving spouse and minor child or
20 minor children.
21 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the
22 surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the decedent
23 pursuant to subsection 3, the court must set aside the estate without
24 the payment of creditors except as the court finds necessary to
25 prevent a manifest injustice.
26 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are
27 nonprobate transfers that already benefit the surviving spouse or
28 minor child or minor children of the decedent, the court has the
29 discretion to reduce the amount set aside under subsection 3 to the
30 extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value of
31 nonprobate transfers, as defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent
32 to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
33 children of the decedent exceeds [$100,000.] $150,000.
34 6. In exercising the discretion granted in this section, the court
35 shall consider the needs and resources of the surviving spouse and
36 minor child or minor children, including any assets received by or
37 for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
38 children from the decedent by nonprobate transfers.
39 7. For the purpose of this section, a nonprobate transfer from
40 the decedent to one or more trusts or custodial accounts for the
41 benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children
42 shall be considered a transfer for the benefit of such spouse or minor
43 child or minor children.

23 or a portion of tax on trust income or principal that is payable by the

33 in the trustee’s sole discretion, reimburse the person being treated
34 as the owner for any amount of the person’s federal, state or other
35 income tax liability that is attributable to the inclusion of the
36 trust’s income, capital gains, deductions or credits in the
37 calculation of the person’s taxable income. In the trustee’s sole
38 discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement amount,
39 determined without regard to any other distribution or payment
40 made from trust assets, to the person directly or to the appropriate
41 taxing authority. A life insurance policy held in the trust, the cash
42 value of any such policy or the proceeds of any loan secured by an
43 interest in the policy may not be used for such reimbursement or
44 payment if the person is an insured.

22 any other person, or that the reimbursement decisions permitted
23 by this section be made directly by a trust adviser, trust protector
24 or any other person, the powers granted by subsection 1 and the
25 provisions of subsection 2 applicable to the trustee are instead also
26 granted or apply, subject to the trust instrument, to the trust
27 adviser, trust protector or other person subject to the limitations
28 set forth in subsection 3, which must be applied as if the trust
29 adviser, trust protector or other person were a trustee.
30 6. The power of a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any
31 other person to make a payment to or for the benefit of a settlor or
32 other person in accordance with subsection 1 or 2 or the decision of
33 a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any other person to
34 exercise such power in favor of the settlor must not cause the settlor
35 or other person to be treated as a beneficiary for purposes of the
36 laws of this State [.] solely by reason of the application of this
37 section. As used in this subsection, “beneficiary” has the meaning
38 ascribed to it in NRS 163.4147.
39 7. This section applies to all trusts described in subsection 2
40 that are governed by the laws of this State or have a principal
41 place of administration within this State whether created before,

9 deduction, that was originally claimed or could have been claimed
10 for the contribution, including:
11 (1) An exclusion under section 2503(b) or 2503(c) of the

24 to any other interested person.
25 2. The notice provided by the trustee must contain:
26 (a) The identity of the settlor of the trust and the date of
27 execution of the trust instrument . [;]
28 (b) The name, mailing address and telephone number of any
29 trustee of the trust . [;]
30 (c) The dispositive provisions of the trust instrument which

35 determined to be in effect at the time of the death of the settlor
36 after the trustee has exercised due diligence.
37 (d) Any information required to be included in the notice
38 expressly provided by the trust instrument . [; and]
39 (e) A statement set forth in a separate paragraph, in 12-point
40 boldface type or an equivalent type which states: “You may not
41 bring an action to contest the trust more than 120 days from the date

43 3. The trustee shall cause notice pursuant to this section to be
44 provided in accordance with the provisions of NRS 155.010.
-
*SB404_R2*
– 23 –
1 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person
2 upon whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may bring an
3 action to contest the validity of the trust more than 120 days from

5 proves that he or she did not receive actual notice. A person upon
6 whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may provide
7 consent in writing to a period of less than 120 days in which the
8 person may bring an action to contest the validity of the trust.
9 5. [For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection 2, a copy of
10 the trust instrument shall be considered complete if it includes all
11 amendments and restatements to the trust instrument the trustee has
12 determined to be in effect at the time of the death of the settlor after
13 the trustee has exercised due diligence.
14 6.] A trustee is not liable in providing information pursuant to
15 paragraph (c) of subsection 2 to any person whom the trustee has
16 determined, after the exercise of due diligence, to be a beneficiary,
17 heir or interested person.
18 6. A person may waive the right to notice contemplated by
19 this section by delivering to the trustee a waiver signed by the
20 person, which shall be deemed irrevocable. Upon delivery of such
21 a waiver to the trustee, the person who waived the right to notice is
22 precluded from bringing any action to contest the validity of the
23 trust.
24 Sec. 22. NRS 164.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 164.045 1. The laws of this State govern the validity and
26 construction of a trust if:
27 (a) The trust instrument so provides;
28 (b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust
29 instrument, has the right to designate the laws that govern the
30 validity and construction of the trust, at the time the designation is
31 made; or
32 (c) The trust instrument does not provide for the law that
33 governs the validity and construction of the trust, a person
34 designated under the terms of the trust instrument to designate the
35 law that governs the validity and construction of the trust, if any, has
36 not made such a designation and the settlor or the trustee of the trust
37 was a resident of this State at the time the trust was created or at the
38 time the trust became irrevocable.
39 2. A person not domiciled in this State may have the right to
40 designate the laws that govern the administration, validity and
41 construction of a trust if properly designated under the trust
42 instrument.
43 3. A trust, the situs of which is outside this State, that moves its
44 situs to this State is valid whether or not the trust complies with the
45 laws of this State at the time of its creation or after its creation.
-
*SB404_R2*
– 24 –
1 4. The laws of this State govern the administration of a trust
2 if:
3 (a) The trust instrument so provides; or
4 (b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust
5 instrument or applicable law, has the right to designate the laws
6 that govern the administration of the trust, at the time the
7 designation is made.
8 5. Notwithstanding a general choice of law provision in the
9 governing instrument of a trust, such as a provision in the
10 governing instrument to the effect that the laws of a jurisdiction
11 other than this State govern the trust or the administration of the
12 trust, the laws of this State govern the administration of the trust
13 while the trust is administered in this State, as provided in
14 subsection 7 or as otherwise provided, unless:
15 (a) The governing instrument expressly provides that the laws
16 of another jurisdiction govern the administration of the trust and
17 that the laws governing the administration of the trust must not
18 change on account of a change in the place of administration of
19 the trust; or
20 (b) Otherwise provided by a court order.
21 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 5, if a
22 fiduciary takes or fails to take action, based on a good faith belief
23 that the laws of a foreign jurisdiction govern the administration of
24 a trust while the trust is administered in this State, the fiduciary’s
25 liability under the governing instrument for the action or inaction
26 must be determined in accordance with the laws of the foreign
27 jurisdiction.
28 7. For purposes of this section and without limiting any other
29 way in which a trust may be considered to be administered in this
30 State, a trust is considered to be administered in this State if all or
31 part of the administration occurs in this State and if:
32 (a) The sole trustee is an individual residing in this State or a
33 corporation or other entity having an office in this State for the
34 conduct of business;
35 (b) The trust has more than one trustee, at least one of which
36 is a corporation or other entity and that corporation or other entity
37 has an office in this State for the conduct of trust business;
38 (c) The trust has more than one trustee, all of whom are
39 persons and more than half of the trustees reside in this State;
40 (d) A trust created pursuant to chapter 166 of NRS meets the
41 requirements set forth in NRS 166.015; or
42 (e) During any such period when the trust is revocable by the
43 settlor who is a resident of this State and there is at least one
44 trustee that is:
45 (1) A resident of this State; or
-
*SB404_R2*
– 25 –
1 (2) A corporation or other entity having an office in this
2 State for the conduct of trust business.
3 Sec. 23. NRS 165.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 165.1214 1. Except as may otherwise be required pursuant to
5 the terms of the trust instrument or by order of the court, the trustee
6 shall deliver a required account within 90 days after the end of the
7 period of account, which may be extended by consent of the
8 beneficiary, or by order of the court for good cause shown.
9 2. The trustee shall be deemed to have provided an account to
10 any person on whom the trustee delivers a copy of the account as
11 directed by order of the court or, if not so ordered, pursuant to the
12 following:
13 (a) By mailing a copy of the account by certified, registered or
14 ordinary first-class mail, or by overnight delivery through a
15 recognized delivery service company, addressed to the person being
16 served at the post office address or physical address given in the
17 person’s demand for account, if any, or at the person’s last place of
18 residence on file with the trustee, if known, or by personally
19 delivering a copy thereof to the person; or
20 (b) By electronic mail or through a secure website on the
21 Internet. For purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be deemed to
22 have received a copy of an account provided by the trustee to the
23 beneficiary by electronic mail or through a secure website on the
24 Internet if the trustee:
25 (1) Sent the beneficiary an electronic mail in a manner that
26 complies with subsection 1 of NRS 719.320 and the beneficiary
27 received the electronic mail in a manner that complies with
28 subsection 2 of NRS 719.320; and
29 (2) Attached the account to the electronic mail as an
30 electronic record or included in the electronic mail a notice to the
31 beneficiary indicating the availability of the account on the secure
32 website.
33 3. Except as otherwise required by the trust instrument, a
34 trustee is not required to provide an account more than once in any
35 calendar year unless ordered by a court upon good cause shown.
36 4. An account must be deemed approved and final as follows:
37 (a) By a beneficiary who received a copy of the account if no
38 written objection is delivered to the trustee in accordance with
39 subsection 2 within 90 days after the date on which the trustee
40 provided the account to that beneficiary . [; or]
41 (b) By all beneficiaries who are not required to receive an
42 account, such as nonvested and contingent beneficiaries, remote
43 beneficiaries, minor beneficiaries, and unborn or unknown
44 beneficiaries if the account is deemed approved and final by a
45 beneficiary who has a similar, but preceding interest, in the trust
-
*SB404_R2*
– 26 –
1 estate, in conformance with NRS 164.038, or as to any beneficiary
2 who has waived an account pursuant to NRS 165.121.
3 (c) By a trust adviser or trust protector if:
4 (1) Notice or information to the beneficiaries has been
5 waived or modified in accordance with NRS 163.004; or
6 (2) It is authorized under the terms of the trust instrument.
7 (d) By all parties to a nonjudicial settlement agreement under
8 paragraph (f) of subsection 3 of NRS 164.940 and regardless of
9 whether the court approves such a nonjudicial settlement
10 agreement under subsection 4 of NRS 164.942.
11  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an account is submitted to the
12 court for approval under a petition pursuant to chapter 164 of NRS,
13 the account must be deemed final and approved upon by order of the
14 court, subject only to the right of an interested person to appeal.
15 5. The trustee, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
16 is released and discharged from any and all liability to any and all
17 beneficiaries of the trust for whom an account is deemed approved
18 and final under subsection 4 as to all matters set forth in such an
19 account.
20 6. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the cost of
21 preparing an account must be paid from the trust estate, and
22 allocated to income and principal as provided in the trust instrument,
23 and if the trust instrument is otherwise silent, in accordance with
24 NRS 164.780 to 164.925, inclusive.
25 [6.] 7. As used in this section:
26 (a) “Electronic mail” has the meaning ascribed to it in
27 NRS 41.715.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the administration of trusts and estates. (Titles 12 and 13
2 of NRS) Sections 1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 4, 5, 11 and 17 of this bill revise certain terms
3 and make technical corrections relating to the administration of trusts and estates.
4 Existing law sets forth an order of priority for the appointment of an
5 administrator to administrate the intestate estate of a decedent and authorizes any
6 person legally qualified to serve as the administrator. (NRS 139.040) Section 1.2 of
7 this bill: (1) revises the order of priority for the appointment of an administrator to
8 administrate the intestate estate of a decedent; (2) provides that a person may be
-
*SB404_R2*

– 2 –
9 legally qualified to serve as an administrator upon a finding of good cause based on
10 certain evidence; and (3) authorizes the court to appoint certain persons under
11 certain circumstances. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to an
12 internal reference caused by the revisions relating to the order of priority and
13 appointment in section 1.2. Section 1.4 of this bill authorizes a court to appoint one
14 or more persons to serve as personal representative or appoint an independent
15 representative under certain circumstances.
16 Existing law establishes the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which
17 allows a personal representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a
18 decedent without court supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill
19 provides that only a personal representative who is named in the will or certain
20 other persons who meet the criteria to be legally qualified as an administrator of an
21 intestate estate may administer an estate. Existing law authorizes any interested
22 person to petition for modification or revocation of the authority of a personal
23 representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill requires the court, when
24 determining whether to revoke the authority of a personal representative, to give
25 preference to any interested person based on the order of priority set forth for the
26 appointment of an administrator for an intestate estate.
27 Under existing law, a court is authorized to enter an order for the summary
28 administration of an estate if the court deems summary administration advisable
29 and the gross value of the estate does not exceed $300,000, after deducting any
30 encumbrances. (NRS 145.040) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill increase that amount to
31 $500,000.
32 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill increase the monetary amount for an estate to be
33 set aside without administration from $100,000 to $150,000. Section 10 of this bill
34 makes a conforming change to similarly increase the affidavit of entitlement limit
35 for a surviving spouse.
36 Existing law requires certain civil actions to recover damages from another
37 person to be commenced within certain periods. (NRS 11.190) Section 12 of this
38 bill provides that an action against certain persons based on a breach of fiduciary
39 duty, not involving fraud or intentional misrepresentation, must be commenced
40 within 2 years.
41 Section 18 of this bill authorizes a trustee to make an outright distribution to a
42 beneficiary without requiring the trustee to first create a new trust under certain
43 circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that
44 certain terms apply to the outright distribution.
45 Section 20 of this bill grants a trustee the power to reimburse a settlor for tax
46 payments. Section 21 of this bill requires certain documentation to be provided to
47 beneficiaries of a trust. Section 22 of this bill specifies the circumstances under
48 which the laws of this State govern the administration of a trust. Section 23 of this
49 bill provides for the circumstances under which an account must be deemed
50 approved and final by a trust adviser or trust protector.
51 Section 32 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which set forth a
52 preference for relatives of the whole blood over relatives of the half blood for
53 certain purposes relating to the administration of an estate.

34 shall petition the court for an order revoking summary
35 administration. The court may, if deemed advisable considering the
36 nature, character and obligations of the estate, provide in its order
37 revoking summary administration that regular administration of the

41 Sec. 8. NRS 146.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 146.020 1. The court, on its own motion or upon petition by

-
*SB404_R2*

– 9 –
1 minor children of the decedent all of the personal property which is
2 exempt by law from execution, and shall, in accordance with NRS
3 146.050, set apart the homestead, as designated by the general
4 homestead law then in force, whether the homestead has theretofore
5 previously been selected as required by law or not, and the property
6 thus set apart is not subject to administration.
7 2. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1,
8 the remaining assets of the estate do not exceed [$100,000]
9 $150,000 and may be set aside without administration pursuant to
10 NRS 146.070, the court shall set aside the remaining assets of the
11 estate without administration pursuant to the procedure set forth in
12 NRS 146.070. The court may consider at the same time a petition
13 made pursuant to subsection 1 and a petition to set aside the
14 remaining assets of the estate without administration pursuant to
15 NRS 146.070.
16 3. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1,
17 the remaining assets of the estate exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and
18 may not be set aside without administration pursuant to NRS
19 146.070, the court shall administer the remaining assets of the estate
20 pursuant to this title as if the remaining assets of the estate are the
21 only assets of the estate. If the petition to set apart property pursuant
22 to subsection 1 is made in the initial petition, the court shall consider
23 only the value of the remaining assets of the estate not set apart
24 pursuant to subsection 1 for the purpose of ordering summary
25 administration pursuant to chapter 145 of NRS.
26 Sec. 9. NRS 146.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 146.070 1. All or part of the estate of a decedent may be set
28 aside without administration by the order of the court as follows:
29 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed
30 [$100,000,] $150,000, the estate may be set aside without
31 administration by the order of the court; or
32 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s
33 estate is to be distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust
34 established by the decedent and in existence at the decedent’s death,
35 the portion of the estate subject to such direction may be set aside
36 without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s estate set aside
37 to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
38 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the
39 court that the trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to
40 such creditors on behalf of the nontestamentary trust and settlor
41 pursuant to NRS 164.025.
42 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the whole
43 estate set aside pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 must be
44 assigned and set apart in the following order:
-
*SB404_R2*

– 10 –
1 (a) To the payment of the petitioner’s attorney’s fees and costs
2 incurred relative to the proceeding under this section;
3 (b) To the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of last illness,
4 money owed to the Department of Health and Human Services as a
5 result of payment of benefits for Medicaid and creditors, if there are
6 any;
7 (c) To the payment of other creditors, if any; and
8 (d) Any balance remaining to the claimant or claimants entitled
9 thereto pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no
10 valid will, pursuant to intestate succession in accordance with
11 chapter 134 of NRS.
12 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed [$100,000]
13 $150,000 and the decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more
14 minor children, the court must set aside the estate for the benefit of
15 the surviving spouse or the minor child or minor children of the
16 decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or
17 5. The court may allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse,
18 the entire amount to the minor child or minor children, or may
19 divide the estate among the surviving spouse and minor child or
20 minor children.
21 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the
22 surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the decedent
23 pursuant to subsection 3, the court must set aside the estate without
24 the payment of creditors except as the court finds necessary to
25 prevent a manifest injustice.
26 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are
27 nonprobate transfers that already benefit the surviving spouse or
28 minor child or minor children of the decedent, the court has the
29 discretion to reduce the amount set aside under subsection 3 to the
30 extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value of
31 nonprobate transfers, as defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent
32 to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
33 children of the decedent exceeds [$100,000.] $150,000.
34 6. In exercising the discretion granted in this section, the court
35 shall consider the needs and resources of the surviving spouse and
36 minor child or minor children, including any assets received by or
37 for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
38 children from the decedent by nonprobate transfers.
39 7. For the purpose of this section, a nonprobate transfer from
40 the decedent to one or more trusts or custodial accounts for the
41 benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children
42 shall be considered a transfer for the benefit of such spouse or minor
43 child or minor children.

31 separate trust is to be established, the executor, trustee or any

22 the consent of a directing trust adviser, to reimburse a settlor for all
23 or a portion of tax on trust income or principal that is payable by the
24 settlor under the law imposing such tax. In the sole discretion of the
25 trustee, the trustee may pay such amount to the settlor directly or to
26 an appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the settlor.
27 2. [A trustee or directing trust adviser] Except as expressly

30 under section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar
31 federal, state or other tax law, in addition to any such discretion
32 conferred under the terms of a trust instrument, the trustee may,
33 in the trustee’s sole discretion, reimburse the person being treated
34 as the owner for any amount of the person’s federal, state or other
35 income tax liability that is attributable to the inclusion of the
36 trust’s income, capital gains, deductions or credits in the
37 calculation of the person’s taxable income. In the trustee’s sole
38 discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement amount,
39 determined without regard to any other distribution or payment
40 made from trust assets, to the person directly or to the appropriate
41 taxing authority. A life insurance policy held in the trust, the cash
42 value of any such policy or the proceeds of any loan secured by an
43 interest in the policy may not be used for such reimbursement or
44 payment if the person is an insured.

1 3. Except as otherwise provided under the trust instrument, a
2 trustee who exercises discretion to make, consent to or direct the

5 reimburse a settlor for tax payable by the settlor on trust income or
6 principal pursuant to subsection 1.
7 [3.] 4. A trustee may not exercise or participate in the
8 exercise of the powers granted by this section with respect to any

21 direction or with the consent of a trust adviser, trust protector or
22 any other person, or that the reimbursement decisions permitted
23 by this section be made directly by a trust adviser, trust protector
24 or any other person, the powers granted by subsection 1 and the
25 provisions of subsection 2 applicable to the trustee are instead also
26 granted or apply, subject to the trust instrument, to the trust
27 adviser, trust protector or other person subject to the limitations
28 set forth in subsection 3, which must be applied as if the trust

*SB404_R2*

– 23 –
1 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person
2 upon whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may bring an
3 action to contest the validity of the trust more than 120 days from
4 the date the notice is served upon the person, unless the person

6 whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may provide
7 consent in writing to a period of less than 120 days in which the
8 person may bring an action to contest the validity of the trust.
9 5. [For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection 2, a copy of
10 the trust instrument shall be considered complete if it includes all
11 amendments and restatements to the trust instrument the trustee has
12 determined to be in effect at the time of the death of the settlor after
13 the trustee has exercised due diligence.
14 6.] A trustee is not liable in providing information pursuant to

16 determined, after the exercise of due diligence, to be a beneficiary,
17 heir or interested person.
18 6. A person may waive the right to notice contemplated by

20 person, which shall be deemed irrevocable. Upon delivery of such
21 a waiver to the trustee, the person who waived the right to notice is
22 precluded from bringing any action to contest the validity of the
23 trust.
24 Sec. 22. NRS 164.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 164.045 1. The laws of this State govern the validity and
26 construction of a trust if:
27 (a) The trust instrument so provides;
28 (b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust
29 instrument, has the right to designate the laws that govern the
30 validity and construction of the trust, at the time the designation is
31 made; or
32 (c) The trust instrument does not provide for the law that
33 governs the validity and construction of the trust, a person
34 designated under the terms of the trust instrument to designate the
35 law that governs the validity and construction of the trust, if any, has

37 was a resident of this State at the time the trust was created or at the
38 time the trust became irrevocable.

40 designate the laws that govern the administration, validity and
41 construction of a trust if properly designated under the trust
42 instrument.

44 situs to this State is valid whether or not the trust complies with the
45 laws of this State at the time of its creation or after its creation.

*SB404_R2*

– 24 –
1 4. The laws of this State govern the administration of a trust
2 if:
3 (a) The trust instrument so provides; or
4 (b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust
5 instrument or applicable law, has the right to designate the laws
6 that govern the administration of the trust, at the time the
7 designation is made.
8 5. Notwithstanding a general choice of law provision in the
9 governing instrument of a trust, such as a provision in the
10 governing instrument to the effect that the laws of a jurisdiction
11 other than this State govern the trust or the administration of the
12 trust, the laws of this State govern the administration of the trust
13 while the trust is administered in this State, as provided in
14 subsection 7 or as otherwise provided, unless:
15 (a) The governing instrument expressly provides that the laws
16 of another jurisdiction govern the administration of the trust and
17 that the laws governing the administration of the trust must not
18 change on account of a change in the place of administration of
19 the trust; or
20 (b) Otherwise provided by a court order.
21 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 5, if a
22 fiduciary takes or fails to take action, based on a good faith belief
23 that the laws of a foreign jurisdiction govern the administration of
24 a trust while the trust is administered in this State, the fiduciary’s
25 liability under the governing instrument for the action or inaction
26 must be determined in accordance with the laws of the foreign
27 jurisdiction.
28 7. For purposes of this section and without limiting any other
29 way in which a trust may be considered to be administered in this
30 State, a trust is considered to be administered in this State if all or
31 part of the administration occurs in this State and if:
32 (a) The sole trustee is an individual residing in this State or a
33 corporation or other entity having an office in this State for the
34 conduct of business;
35 (b) The trust has more than one trustee, at least one of which

39 persons and more than half of the trustees reside in this State;
40 (d) A trust created pursuant to chapter 166 of NRS meets the

42 (e) During any such period when the trust is revocable by the
43 settlor who is a resident of this State and there is at least one
44 trustee that is:
45 (1) A resident of this State; or
-
*SB404_R2*

– 25 –
1 (2) A corporation or other entity having an office in this
2 State for the conduct of trust business.
3 Sec. 23. NRS 165.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 165.1214 1. Except as may otherwise be required pursuant to
5 the terms of the trust instrument or by order of the court, the trustee
6 shall deliver a required account within 90 days after the end of the

8 beneficiary, or by order of the court for good cause shown.
9 2. The trustee shall be deemed to have provided an account to

12 following:
13 (a) By mailing a copy of the account by certified, registered or
14 ordinary first-class mail, or by overnight delivery through a
15 recognized delivery service company, addressed to the person being
16 served at the post office address or physical address given in the
17 person’s demand for account, if any, or at the person’s last place of
18 residence on file with the trustee, if known, or by personally
19 delivering a copy thereof to the person; or
20 (b) By electronic mail or through a secure website on the
21 Internet. For purposes of this paragraph, a person shall be deemed to
22 have received a copy of an account provided by the trustee to the
23 beneficiary by electronic mail or through a secure website on the
24 Internet if the trustee:
25 (1) Sent the beneficiary an electronic mail in a manner that
26 complies with subsection 1 of NRS 719.320 and the beneficiary
27 received the electronic mail in a manner that complies with
28 subsection 2 of NRS 719.320; and
29 (2) Attached the account to the electronic mail as an
30 electronic record or included in the electronic mail a notice to the
31 beneficiary indicating the availability of the account on the secure
32 website.
33 3. Except as otherwise required by the trust instrument, a
34 trustee is not required to provide an account more than once in any
35 calendar year unless ordered by a court upon good cause shown.
36 4. An account must be deemed approved and final as follows:
37 (a) By a beneficiary who received a copy of the account if no
38 written objection is delivered to the trustee in accordance with

40 provided the account to that beneficiary . [; or]
41 (b) By all beneficiaries who are not required to receive an
42 account, such as nonvested and contingent beneficiaries, remote
43 beneficiaries, minor beneficiaries, and unborn or unknown
44 beneficiaries if the account is deemed approved and final by a
45 beneficiary who has a similar, but preceding interest, in the trust
-
*SB404_R2*

1 estate, in conformance with NRS 164.038, or as to any beneficiary
2 who has waived an account pursuant to NRS 165.121.
3 (c) By a trust adviser or trust protector if:
4 (1) Notice or information to the beneficiaries has been
5 waived or modified in accordance with NRS 163.004; or
6 (2) It is authorized under the terms of the trust instrument.
7 (d) By all parties to a nonjudicial settlement agreement under
8 paragraph (f) of subsection 3 of NRS 164.940 and regardless of
9 whether the court approves such a nonjudicial settlement
10 agreement under subsection 4 of NRS 164.942.
11  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an account is submitted to the
12 court for approval under a petition pursuant to chapter 164 of NRS,
13 the account must be deemed final and approved upon by order of the
14 court, subject only to the right of an interested person to appeal.
15 5. The trustee, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
16 is released and discharged from any and all liability to any and all
17 beneficiaries of the trust for whom an account is deemed approved
18 and final under subsection 4 as to all matters set forth in such an
19 account.
20 6. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the cost of
21 preparing an account must be paid from the trust estate, and
22 allocated to income and principal as provided in the trust instrument,
23 and if the trust instrument is otherwise silent, in accordance with
24 NRS 164.780 to 164.925, inclusive.
