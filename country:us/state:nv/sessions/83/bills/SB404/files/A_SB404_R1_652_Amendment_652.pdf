Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the administration of trusts and estates. (Titles 12 and 13 of NRS)
2 Sections 1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 4, 5, 11 and 17 of this bill revise certain terms and make technical
3 corrections relating to the administration of trusts and estates.
4 Existing law sets forth an order of priority for the appointment of an administrator to
5 administrate the intestate estate of a decedent and authorizes any person legally qualified to
6 serve as the administrator. (NRS 139.040) Section 1.2 of this bill: (1) revises the order of
7 priority for the appointment of an administrator to administrate the intestate estate of a
8 decedent; (2) provides that a person may be legally qualified to serve as an administrator upon
9 a finding of good cause based on certain evidence; and (3) authorizes the court to appoint
10 certain persons under certain circumstances. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming
11 change to an internal reference caused by the revisions relating to the order of priority and
12 appointment in section 1.2. Section 1.4 of this bill authorizes a court to appoint one or more
13 persons to serve as personal representative or appoint an independent [personal]
14 representative under certain circumstances.

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 4
15 Existing law establishes the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which allows a
16 personal representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a decedent without court
17 supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill provides that only a personal
18 representative who is named in the will or certain other persons who meet the criteria to be
19 legally qualified as an administrator of an intestate estate may administer an estate. Existing
20 law authorizes any interested person to petition for modification or revocation of the authority
21 of a personal representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill requires the court, when
22 determining whether to revoke the authority of a personal representative, to give preference to
23 any interested person based on the order of priority set forth for the appointment of an
24 administrator for an intestate estate.
25 Under existing law, a court is authorized to enter an order for the summary administration
26 of an estate if the court deems summary administration advisable and the gross value of the
27 estate does not exceed $300,000, after deducting any encumbrances. (NRS 145.040) Sections
28 6 and 7 of this bill increase that amount to $500,000.
29 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill increase the monetary amount for an estate to be set aside
30 without administration from $100,000 to $150,000. Section 10 of this bill makes a
31 conforming change to similarly increase the affidavit of entitlement limit for a surviving
32 spouse.
33 Existing law requires certain civil actions to recover damages from another person to be
34 commenced within certain periods. (NRS 11.190) Section 12 of this bill provides that an
35 action against certain persons based on a breach of fiduciary duty, not involving fraud or
36 intentional misrepresentation, must be commenced within 2 years.
37 [Existing law exempts certain property from a writ of execution to enforce a judgment,
38 including certain property known as a homestead. (NRS 21.090) Section 13 of this bill
39 removes the monetary dollar amounts relating to a homestead from NRS 21.090 and instead
40 refers to the amount of the value of such exemptions set forth in chapter 115 of NRS.
41 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing durable powers of attorney for health
42 care decisions, including a form to create an advance health-care directive. (NRS 162A.700-
43 162A.870) Section 14 of this bill establishes an alternative form to create an advance health-
44 care directive. Sections 15, 16 and 24-30 of this bill make conforming changes to reference
45 the alternative form.]
46 Section 18 of this bill authorizes a trustee to make an outright distribution to a beneficiary
47 without requiring the trustee to first create a new trust under certain circumstances. Section 19
48 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that certain terms apply to the outright
49 distribution.
50 Section 20 of this bill grants a trustee the power to reimburse a settlor for tax payments.
51 Section 21 of this bill requires certain documentation to be provided to beneficiaries of a trust.
52 Section 22 of this bill specifies the circumstances under which the laws of this State govern
53 the administration of a trust. Section 23 of this bill provides for the circumstances under
54 which an account must be deemed approved and final by a trust adviser or trust protector.
55 Section 32 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which set forth a preference
56 for relatives of the whole blood over relatives of the half blood for certain purposes relating to
57 the administration of an estate.

45 person, the court may appoint the guardian or equivalent fiduciary as
46 administrator. The guardian or equivalent fiduciary has the same priority for

15 qualification of the nominator.

25 inventory with the clerk, shall mail a copy to all the interested heirs of an intestate
26 estate, or to the devisees of a testate estate, or to both interested heirs and devisees,
27 if a contest of the will of the decedent is pending. Proof of the mailing of the copies

30 representative may file a redacted inventory to protect the decedent or his or her
31 estate or an interested person. Such an inventory may redact any account numbers,
32 social security numbers and values. Upon request by the court or an interested
33 person, the personal representative shall make the full inventory without redaction
34 available for inspection.
35 5. This section must not be construed to interfere with the authority of a court
36 to order a personal representative to provide the court with information sufficient to
37 identify the assets of an estate and the value thereof that is subject to probate
38 administration, including, without limitation, requiring the personal representative
39 to submit an inventory to the court in camera, as the court deems necessary and

44 Sec. 6. NRS 145.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 145.040 If it is made to appear to the court that the gross value of the estate,
46 after deducting any encumbrances, does not exceed [$300,000,] $500,000, the court

48 estate, enter an order for a summary administration of the estate.
49 Sec. 7. NRS 145.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:

51 administration of an estate it appears that the gross value of the estate, after

53 decedent, the personal representative shall petition the court for an order revoking

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 9
1 summary administration. The court may, if deemed advisable considering the
2 nature, character and obligations of the estate, provide in its order revoking
3 summary administration that regular administration of the estate may proceed
4 unabated upon providing such portions of the regular proceedings and notices as
5 were dispensed with by the order for summary administration.
6 Sec. 8. NRS 146.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 146.020 1. The court, on its own motion or upon petition by an interested
8 person, may, if deemed advisable considering the needs and resources of the
9 surviving spouse, minor child or minor children, set apart for the use of the
10 surviving spouse, minor child or minor children of the decedent all of the personal
11 property which is exempt by law from execution, and shall, in accordance with
12 NRS 146.050, set apart the homestead, as designated by the general homestead law
13 then in force, whether the homestead has theretofore previously been selected as
14 required by law or not, and the property thus set apart is not subject to
15 administration.
16 2. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1, the remaining
17 assets of the estate do not exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and may be set aside
18 without administration pursuant to NRS 146.070, the court shall set aside the
19 remaining assets of the estate without administration pursuant to the procedure set
20 forth in NRS 146.070. The court may consider at the same time a petition made
21 pursuant to subsection 1 and a petition to set aside the remaining assets of the estate
22 without administration pursuant to NRS 146.070.
23 3. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1, the remaining
24 assets of the estate exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and may not be set aside without
25 administration pursuant to NRS 146.070, the court shall administer the remaining
26 assets of the estate pursuant to this title as if the remaining assets of the estate are
27 the only assets of the estate. If the petition to set apart property pursuant to
28 subsection 1 is made in the initial petition, the court shall consider only the value of
29 the remaining assets of the estate not set apart pursuant to subsection 1 for the
30 purpose of ordering summary administration pursuant to chapter 145 of NRS.
31 Sec. 9. NRS 146.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 146.070 1. All or part of the estate of a decedent may be set aside without
33 administration by the order of the court as follows:
34 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed [$100,000,] $150,000,
35 the estate may be set aside without administration by the order of the court; or
36 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s estate is to be
37 distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust established by the decedent and
38 in existence at the decedent’s death, the portion of the estate subject to such
39 direction may be set aside without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s
40 estate set aside to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
41 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the court that the
42 trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to such creditors on behalf of
43 the nontestamentary trust and settlor pursuant to NRS 164.025.
44 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the whole estate set aside
45 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 must be assigned and set apart in the
46 following order:
47 (a) To the payment of the petitioner’s attorney’s fees and costs incurred
48 relative to the proceeding under this section;
49 (b) To the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of last illness, money owed
50 to the Department of Health and Human Services as a result of payment of benefits
51 for Medicaid and creditors, if there are any;
52 (c) To the payment of other creditors, if any; and

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 10
1 (d) Any balance remaining to the claimant or claimants entitled thereto
2 pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no valid will, pursuant to
3 intestate succession in accordance with chapter 134 of NRS.
4 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and the
5 decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more minor children, the court must set
6 aside the estate for the benefit of the surviving spouse or the minor child or minor
7 children of the decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or
8 5. The court may allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse, the entire
9 amount to the minor child or minor children, or may divide the estate among the
10 surviving spouse and minor child or minor children.
11 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or
12 minor child or minor children of the decedent pursuant to subsection 3, the court
13 must set aside the estate without the payment of creditors except as the court finds
14 necessary to prevent a manifest injustice.
15 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are nonprobate transfers that
16 already benefit the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the
17 decedent, the court has the discretion to reduce the amount set aside under
18 subsection 3 to the extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value
19 of nonprobate transfers, as defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent to or for the
20 benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the decedent
21 exceeds [$100,000.] $150,000.
22 6. In exercising the discretion granted in this section, the court shall consider
23 the needs and resources of the surviving spouse and minor child or minor children,

25 3. CREATION OF DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR
26 HEALTH CARE
27
28 By this document I intend to create a durable power of attorney by
29 appointing the person designated above to make health care decisions for
30 me. This power of attorney shall not be affected by my subsequent
31 incapacity. My goal is to reduce the intervention of a court in my affairs
32 by allowing for care without the need for guardianship.
33
34 By signing this document, I revoke any prior durable power of
35 attorney for health care that I may have made.
36
37 If my designated agent is my spouse or is one of my children, then I
38 waive any conflict of interest in carrying out the provisions of this
39 Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care that said spouse or child may
40 have by reason of the fact that he or she may be a beneficiary of my
41 estate.
42
43 4. GENERAL STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY GRANTED
44
45 In the event that I am incapable of giving informed consent with
46 respect to health care decisions, I hereby grant to the agent named above
47 full power and authority to make health care decisions for me before or
48 after my death, including consent, refusal of consent or withdrawal of
49 consent to any care, treatment, service or procedure to maintain,
50 diagnose or treat a physical or mental condition; to request, review and
51 receive any information, verbal or written, regarding my physical or
52 mental health, including, without limitation, medical and hospital
53 records; to execute on my behalf any releases or other documents that

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 23
1 may be required to obtain medical care and/or medical and hospital
2 records, EXCEPT any power to enter into any arbitration agreements or
3 execute any arbitration clauses in connection with admission to any
4 health care facility, including any skilled nursing facility; and subject
5 only to the limitations and special provisions, if any, set forth below.
6
7 PART 2: HEALTH CARE INSTRUCTION
8
9 This part lets you state your limitations and priorities for health care
10 and the types of health care you do or do not want.
11
12 I give my agent the power to make all health care decisions for me if I
13 cannot make those decisions for myself, except for the following:
14 ............................................ or as set forth below.
15
16 INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT. This
17 section gives you the opportunity to say how you want your agent to act
18 while making decisions for you. You may mark or initial each item or
19 leave any item blank.
20
21 Prolonging life vs. dying a natural death
22
23 1. ( ) I desire that my life be prolonged to the greatest extent
24 possible without regard to my condition, the chances I have for
25 recovery or long-term survival, or the cost of the procedures. In
26 other words, keep my body alive even if my doctors have
27 reasonably concluded that there is no reasonable hope for long-
28 term recovery or survival or that my coma (if I am in one) is
29 irreversible. If you select this choice, do not initial choices 2, 3, 4
30 or 5, as those are inconsistent with this choice.
31
32 2. ( ) If I am in a coma which my doctors have reasonably
33 concluded is irreversible, I desire that life-sustaining or
34 prolonging treatments not be used.
35
36 3. ( ) If I have an incurable or terminal condition or illness and no
37 reasonable hope of long-term recovery or survival, I desire that
38 life-sustaining or prolonging treatments not be used.
39
40 4. ( ) I have reviewed the Nevada POLST form (sample attached
41 hereto as Exhibit 1). If in the future I have not executed a POLST
42 form and my physician determines, or my agent suspects, that
43 execution of a POLST is appropriate, then my agent is authorized
44 to execute a POLST on my behalf in accordance with my wishes
45 stated in this, my Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.
46
47 GI feeding tube or IV. I understand that withholding or withdrawal of
48 artificial nutrition and hydration may result in death by starvation or
49 dehydration. For some people this may be a tenet of their religion. For
50 some people it may not make sense to continue this when all other
51 treatment (machines) is terminated.

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 24
1 5. ( ) I do not want continued artificial nutrition and hydration
2 (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or intravenous liquids) after all
3 other treatment is terminated.
4
5 6. ( ) I do want continued artificial nutrition and hydration (e.g.
6 gastrointestinal feeding tube or intravenous liquids) after all
7 other treatment is terminated. If I initial this section, you are
8 asked to continue to give me the artificial nutrition and hydration.
9
10 7. ( ) I understand that continued artificial nutrition and hydration
11 (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or intravenous liquids) will
12 likely occur if my physician reasonably believes that providing
13 such will lead to my recovery. However, I do not want to continue
14 to receive artificial nutrition and hydration if it is expected to
15 continue for the rest of my life.
16
17 Experimental procedures, treatments and drugs. I understand that it can
18 take a long time to obtain FDA approval for new medical procedures,
19 treatments and drugs. As a result, many are categorized as
20 “experimental.” I also understand that some of such procedures,
21 treatments or drugs have a good record of success and that some contain
22 risks. I also understand that experimental procedures, treatments and
23 drugs can only be given to me if I authorize them.
24
25 8. ( ) I authorize my agent to enroll me in experimental procedures
26 or treatments if said procedures or treatments are recommended
27 by my physician and my agent consents. My agent is to consider
28 the relief of suffering, the preservation or restoration of
29 functioning, and the quality as well as the extent of the possible
30 extension of my life in making that decision. My agent is to
31 consider whether the expected benefits outweigh the burdens of
32 the treatment or drug.
33
34 9. ( ) I do not want any experimental procedures, treatments or
35 drugs.
36
37 Palliative care (Dying with dignity/Use of pain relieving drugs)
38
39 10. ( ) When I die, I wish to do so with dignity and grace and
40 without pain and suffering. If I have an incurable or terminal
41 condition, including but not limited to late stage dementia, and no
42 reasonable hope of long-term recovery or survival, I desire my
43 attending physician to administer any medication to alleviate
44 suffering without regard to the fact that the medication may be
45 addictive or may reduce the extension of my life.
46
47 11. ( ) I do not wish to have any medication that may be addictive
48 or reduce the extension of my life.
49 Assisted living or other facility
50
51 12. ( ) I desire to live in my home for as long as it is safe and my
52 medical needs can be met. My agent may arrange for a natural
53 person, employee of an agency or provider of community-based

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 25
1 services to come into my home to provide care for me. When it is
2 no longer safe for me to live in my home, I authorize my agent to
3 place me in a facility or home that can provide any medical
4 assistance and support in my activities of daily living that I
5 require. Before being placed in such a facility or home, I wish for
6 my agent to discuss and share information concerning the
7 placement with me, and allow me to participate in the choice of
8 said facility or home. If I am married, placement shall be done in
9 a manner that considers my spouse’s support needs.
10
11 13. ( ) I refuse to be placed in any assisted living or other care
12 facility. I understand that, before I may be placed in a facility or
13 home other than the home in which I currently reside, a guardian
14 must be appointed for me, which means that a court action would
15 be needed to remove me from my home.
16
17 ( ) Other (write what you want or do not want):

20 INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT PRIORITIES
21
22 You can use this section to provide any other information about your
23 goals, values and preferences for treatment, including care you want or
24 do not want. To the extent that you make entries in this section, this
25 information is for your agent and is not intended to limit or impair the
26 physician’s determination of a course of treatment, nor to subject the
27 physician to legal claims. You can also use this section to name anyone
28 whom you do not want to make decisions for you under any conditions.
29 (Insert such priorities, if any.)
30 .......................................................................................................................
31 .......................................................................................................................
32
33 PART 3: OPTIONAL SPECIAL POWERS AND GUIDANCE
34
35 This part allows you to give your agent additional powers and to provide
36 your agent with more guidance about your wishes. You may mark or
37 initial each item. You also may leave any item blank.
38
39 Mental health care or cognitive rehabilitation
40
41 14. ( ) I authorize my agent to admit me as a voluntary patient to a
42 facility for mental health or place me in rehabilitative care if my
43 agent determines such treatment is best for my health and safety,
44 or if it is recommended by a physician.
45
46 15. ( ) I do not authorize my agent to admit me as a voluntary
47 patient to a facility for mental health or place me in rehabilitative
48 care even if my agent determines such treatment is best for my
49 health and safety, or even if it is recommended by a physician.
50
51 ACCESS TO MY HEALTH INFORMATION (HIPAA). I give my
52 agent permission to examine and share information about my health
53 needs and health care if I am not able to make decisions for myself. By

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 26
1 signing this form, I give the authorization and full release of information
2 by any government agency, medical provider, business, creditor or third
3 party who may have information pertaining to my health care to my agent
4 named herein, pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and
5 Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, as amended, and
6 applicable regulations.
7
8 GUIDANCE FOR MY AGENT. The instructions I have stated in this
9 document should guide my agent in making decisions for me. (Initial or
10 mark one of the items below to tell your agent more about how to use
11 these instructions.):
12
13 16. ( ) I give my agent permission to be flexible in applying these
14 instructions if he or she thinks it would be in my best interest
15 based on what they know about me and the recommendations of
16 the attending physician.
17
18 17. ( ) I want my agent to follow these instructions exactly as
19 written if possible, even if he or she thinks something else is
20 better.
21
22 GOOD FAITH CARE. My wish is that the provider of health care
23 work cooperatively with me and my agent for my care. To that end, a
24 provider of health care who relies in good faith on the provisions of this
25 advance health-care directive shall be immune from criminal and civil
26 liability applicable to the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining
27 treatment. As such, the liability protection provisions already in law in
28 NRS 449A.727 shall apply whether or not this advance health-care
29 directive is retrieved from the Registry established by the Nevada
30 Secretary of State.
31
32 NOMINATION OF GUARDIAN. A guardian is a person appointed
33 by a court to make decisions for someone who cannot make decisions.
34 Filling this out does NOT mean you want or need a guardian right now.
35
36 If a court appoints a guardian to make personal decisions for me, I want
37 the court to choose my agent named in this form. If my agent cannot be a
38 guardian, I want my alternate agent(s) in the order named in this form. If
39 I prefer someone other than the agent(s) named in this form, their name
40 and contact information is: ..........................................................................
41 .......................................................................................................................
42 .......................................................................................................................
43
44 AMENDMENT; RIGHT TO TERMINATE. This durable power of
45 attorney may be amended. This document shall not be terminated by
46 anyone other than me and it shall not be terminated by a governmental
47 entity, including a court.
48
49 PART 4: ORGAN DONATION
50
51 This part allows you to donate your organs when you die. You may
52 mark or initial each item. You also may leave any item blank.

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 27

2 dying process and might be in conflict with other instructions I have put
3 in this form, upon my death:

22
23 PART 5: CHALLENGES
24
25 If the legality of any provision of this Durable Power of Attorney for
26 Health Care is questioned by my physician, my advanced practice
27 registered nurse, my agent or a third party, then my agent is authorized to
28 commence an action for declaratory judgment as to the legality of the
29 provision in question. The cost of any such action is to be paid from my
30 estate. This Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care must be

5 meanings ascribed to them in those sections.] (Deleted by amendment.)
6 Sec. 17. NRS 162B.510 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 162B.510 1. Appointive property subject to a general power of appointment
8 created by a person other than the powerholder is not subject to a claim of any
9 creditor, unless the power of appointment was held by a decedent who actually
10 exercised the power in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate pursuant to
11 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 12 of NRS 111.779.
12 2. Subject to subsection 3 of NRS 162B.530, a power of appointment created
13 by a person other than the powerholder which is subject to an ascertainable
14 standard relating to an individual’s health, education, support or maintenance
15 within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 2041(b)(1)(A) or 26 U.S.C. § 2514(c)(1), as

18 Sec. 18. Chapter 163 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
19 section to read as follows:
20 1. Unless specifically prohibited by the terms of a will or trust instrument
21 and except as provided in subsection 2, if an instrument creating a separate trust
22 requires the assets of the separate trust to be distributed to the beneficiary or
23 beneficiaries of the trust immediately after the establishment of the separate trust
24 as a result of the circumstances existing at the time the separate trust is to be
25 established, the executor, trustee or any other party having possession of the
26 property with which the separate trust will be funded may exercise discretion to
27 make a distribution directly to the beneficiary or the beneficiaries of the separate
28 trust.
29 2. An executor, trustee or any other party described in subsection 1 may
30 exercise discretion rather than distributing the trust assets to the trustee of the
31 separate trust if the transferring executor, trustee or any other party described in
32 subsection 1 and the trustee of the separate trust are the same person.
33 3. The receipts of distribution provided to any beneficiary or beneficiaries
34 in the manner described in this section shall be deemed to protect the executor,
35 trustee or other person having possession of the property to the same extent that a
36 receipt of distribution would have protected the executor, trustee or other person
37 had the property been distributed by the trustee from the separate trust.
38 Sec. 19. NRS 163.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
39 163.020 As used in NRS 163.010 to 163.200, inclusive, and section 18 of

50 Sec. 20. NRS 163.557 is hereby amended to read as follows:
51 163.557 1. A governing trust instrument may authorize the trustee, in the
52 sole discretion of the trustee or at the direction or with the consent of a directing
53 trust adviser, to reimburse a settlor for all or a portion of tax on trust income or

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 30
1 principal that is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax. In the sole
2 discretion of the trustee, the trustee may pay such amount to the settlor directly or
3 to an appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the settlor.
4 2. [A trustee or directing trust adviser] Except as expressly prohibited or
5 otherwise provided under the trust instrument, if all or any portion of the trust is
6 treated as being owned by a person under section 671 of the Internal Revenue
7 Code or any similar federal, state or other tax law, in addition to any such
8 discretion conferred under the terms of a trust instrument, the trustee may, in the
9 trustee’s sole discretion, reimburse the person being treated as the owner for any
10 amount of the person’s federal, state or other income tax liability that is
11 attributable to the inclusion of the trust’s income, capital gains, deductions or
12 credits in the calculation of the person’s taxable income. In the trustee’s sole
13 discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement amount, determined
14 without regard to any other distribution or payment made from trust assets, to the
15 person directly or to the appropriate taxing authority. A life insurance policy held
16 in the trust, the cash value of any such policy or the proceeds of any loan secured
17 by an interest in the policy may not be used for such reimbursement or payment if
18 the person is an insured.
19 3. Except as otherwise provided under the trust instrument, a trustee who
20 exercises discretion to make, consent to or direct the decision to reimburse the
21 settlor under subsection 1 or 2 is not liable to any person in exercising such
22 discretion to reimburse or not reimburse a settlor for tax payable by the settlor on
23 trust income or principal pursuant to subsection 1.
24 [3.] 4. A trustee may not exercise or participate in the exercise of the
25 powers granted by this section with respect to any trust if the trustee is:
26 (a) Treated as the owner of all or part of the trust under section 671 of the
27 Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state or other tax law;
28 (b) A beneficiary of the trust; or
29 (c) A related or subordinate party, as defined in section 672(c) of the Internal
30 Revenue Code, with respect to:
31 (1) A person treated as the owner of all or part of the trust under section
32 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state or other tax law;
33 or
34 (2) A beneficiary of the trust.
35 5. If the trust instrument requires the trustee to act at the direction or with
36 the consent of a trust adviser, trust protector or any other person, or that the
37 reimbursement decisions permitted by this section be made directly by a trust
38 adviser, trust protector or any other person, the powers granted by subsection 1
39 and the provisions of subsection 2 applicable to the trustee are instead also
40 granted or apply, subject to the trust instrument, to the trust adviser, trust
41 protector or other person subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 3,
42 which must be applied as if the trust adviser, trust protector or other person were
43 a trustee.
44 6. The power of a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any other person
45 to make a payment to or for the benefit of a settlor or other person in accordance
46 with subsection 1 or 2 or the decision of a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or
47 any other person to exercise such power in favor of the settlor must not cause the
48 settlor or other person to be treated as a beneficiary for purposes of the laws of this
49 State [.] solely by reason of the application of this section. As used in this
50 subsection, “beneficiary” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 163.4147.
51 7. This section applies to all trusts described in subsection 2 that are
52 governed by the laws of this State or have a principal place of administration
53 within this State whether created before, on or after October 1, 2025, unless:

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 31
1 (a) At least 60 days before the effective date of such election, the trustee
2 provides written notice that the trustee intends to irrevocably elect out of the
3 application of this section to:
4 (1) The person treated as the owner of all or a portion of the trust under
5 section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state or other
6 tax law; and
7 (2) All persons who have the ability to remove and replace the trustee
8 under the terms of the trust instrument.
9 (b) Applying the discretion conferred under subsection [1] 2 will prevent a
10 contribution to the trust from qualifying for or reducing a federal tax benefit,
11 including a federal tax exclusion or deduction, that was originally claimed or
12 could have been claimed for the contribution, including:
13 (1) An exclusion under section 2503(b) or 2503(c) of the Internal
14 Revenue Code;
15 (2) A marital deduction under section 2056, 2056A or 2523 of the
16 Internal Revenue Code;

19 (4) Direct skip treatment under section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue
20 Code.
21 Sec. 21. NRS 164.021 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 164.021 1. When a revocable trust becomes irrevocable because of the
23 death of a settlor or by the express terms of the trust, the trustee may, after the trust
24 becomes irrevocable, provide notice to any beneficiary of the irrevocable trust, any
25 heir of the settlor or to any other interested person.

32 beneficiary, a complete copy of the trust instrument or notice that the heir or
33 interested person is not a beneficiary under the trust . [;] As used in this paragraph,

38 by the trust instrument . [; and]
39 (e) A statement set forth in a separate paragraph, in 12-point boldface type or

42 3. The trustee shall cause notice pursuant to this section to be provided in
43 accordance with the provisions of NRS 155.010.
44 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person upon whom
45 notice is provided pursuant to this section may bring an action to contest the
46 validity of the trust more than 120 days from the date the notice is served upon the
47 person, unless the person proves that he or she did not receive actual notice. A
48 person upon whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may provide consent
49 in writing to a period of less than 120 days in which the person may bring an action
50 to contest the validity of the trust.
51 5. [For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection 2, a copy of the trust
52 instrument shall be considered complete if it includes all amendments and

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 32
1 restatements to the trust instrument the trustee has determined to be in effect at the
2 time of the death of the settlor after the trustee has exercised due diligence.
3 6.] A trustee is not liable in providing information pursuant to paragraph (c)
4 of subsection 2 to any person whom the trustee has determined, after the exercise of
5 due diligence, to be a beneficiary, heir or interested person.
6 6. A person may waive the right to notice contemplated by this section by
7 delivering to the trustee a waiver signed by the person, which shall be deemed
8 irrevocable. Upon delivery of such a waiver to the trustee, the person who waived
9 the right to notice is precluded from bringing any action to contest the validity of
10 the trust.
11 Sec. 22. NRS 164.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 164.045 1. The laws of this State govern the validity and construction of a
13 trust if:

31 (a) The trust instrument so provides; or

36 instrument of a trust, such as a provision in the governing instrument to the
37 effect that the laws of a jurisdiction other than this State govern the trust or the
38 administration of the trust, the laws of this State govern the administration of the
39 trust while the trust is administered in this State, as provided in subsection 7 or as
40 otherwise provided, unless:
41 (a) The governing instrument expressly provides that the laws of another
42 jurisdiction govern the administration of the trust and that the laws governing the

50 or inaction must be determined in accordance with the laws of the foreign
51 jurisdiction.

53 a trust may be considered to be administered in this State, a trust is considered to

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 33

23 NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
24
25 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance directive to provide
26 consent or refuse to consent to future psychiatric care if the person later
27 becomes incapable of making or communicating those decisions. By
28 executing a durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
29 162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive, and section 14 of this act, the person
30 may also appoint an agent to make decisions regarding psychiatric care for
31 the person when incapable. A person is “incapable” for the purposes of this
32 advance directive when in the opinion of two providers of health care, one
33 of whom must be a physician or licensed psychologist and the other of
34 whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed psychologist, a
35 psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who has the
36 psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
37 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person currently lacks sufficient
38 understanding or capacity to make or communicate decisions regarding
39 psychiatric care. If a person is determined to be incapable, the person may
40 be found capable when, in the opinion of the person’s attending physician
41 or an advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric training
42 and experience prescribed by the State Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS
43 632.120 and has an established relationship with the person, the person has
44 regained sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate
45 decisions regarding psychiatric care. This document becomes effective
46 upon its proper execution and remains valid for a period of 2 years after the
47 date of its execution unless revoked. Upon being presented with this
48 advance directive, the physician or other provider of health care must make
49 it a part of the person’s medical record. The physician or other provider
50 must act in accordance with the statements expressed in the advance
51 directive when the person is determined to be incapable, except as
52 otherwise provided in NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider shall
53 promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the agent of the principal,

Assembly Amendment No. 652 to Senate Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 37
1 and document in the principal’s medical record any act or omission that is
2 not in compliance with any part of an advance directive. A physician or
3 other provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated
4 and notarized advance directive.

6 ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR PSYCHIATRIC CARE
7
8 I, .............................., being an adult of sound mind or an emancipated
9 minor, willfully and voluntarily make this advance directive for psychiatric
10 care to be followed if it is determined by two providers of health care, one

12 other of whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed
13 psychologist, a psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who
14 has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
15 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive and evaluate
16 information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an
17 extent that I lack the capacity to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I
18 understand that psychiatric care may not be administered without my
19 express and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my informed
20 consent, the express and informed consent of my legally responsible
21 person, my agent named pursuant to a valid durable power of attorney for
22 health care or my consent expressed in this advance directive for
23 psychiatric care. I understand that I may become incapable of giving or
24 withholding informed consent or refusal for psychiatric care due to the
25 symptoms of a diagnosed mental disorder. These symptoms may include:
