Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the administration of trusts and estates. (Titles 12 and 13 of
2 NRS) Sections 1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 4, 5, 11 and 17 of this bill revise certain terms and make
3 technical corrections relating to the administration of trusts and estates.
4 Existing law sets forth an order of priority for the appointment of an administrator to
5 administrate the intestate estate of a decedent and authorizes any person legally qualified to
6 serve as the administrator. (NRS 139.040) Section [1] 1.2 of this bill : (1) revises the order
7 of priority for the appointment of an administrator to administrate the intestate estate of
8 a decedent; (2) provides that a person may be legally qualified to serve as an administrator
9 upon a finding of good cause based on certain evidence [.] ; and (3) authorizes the court to
10 appoint certain persons under certain circumstances. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a
11 conforming change to an internal reference caused by the revisions relating to the order
12 of priority and appointment in section 1.2. Section 1.4 of this bill authorizes a court to
13 appoint one or more persons or an independent personal representative under certain
14 circumstances.

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 4
15 Existing law establishes the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which allows a
16 personal representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a decedent without court
17 supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill [requires a] provides that only a
18 personal representative who [otherwise meets] is named in the will or certain other persons
19 who meet the criteria to be legally qualified as an administrator of an intestate estate [to
20 provide certain evidence to the court.] may administer an estate. Existing law authorizes any
21 interested person to petition for modification or revocation of the authority of a personal
22 representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill requires the court, when determining
23 whether to revoke the authority of a personal representative, to give preference to any
24 interested person based on the order of priority set forth for the appointment of an
25 administrator for an intestate estate.
26 Under existing law, a court is authorized to enter an order for the summary
27 administration of an estate if the court deems summary administration advisable and
28 the gross value of the estate does not exceed $300,000, after deducting any
29 encumbrances. (NRS 145.040) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill increase that amount to
30 $500,000.
31 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill increase the monetary amount for an estate to be set
32 aside without administration from $100,000 to $150,000. Section 10 of this bill makes a
33 conforming change to similarly increase the affidavit of entitlement limit for a surviving
34 spouse.
35 Existing law requires certain civil actions to recover damages from another person
36 to be commenced within certain periods. (NRS 11.190) Section 12 of this bill provides
37 that an action against certain persons based on a breach of fiduciary duty, not involving
38 fraud or intentional misrepresentation, must be commenced within 2 years.
39 Existing law exempts certain property from a writ of execution to enforce a
40 judgment, including certain property known as a homestead. (NRS 21.090) Section 13 of
41 this bill removes the monetary dollar amounts relating to a homestead from NRS 21.090
42 and instead refers to the amount of the value of such exemptions set forth in chapter 115
43 of NRS.
44 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing durable powers of attorney for
45 health care decisions, including a form to create an advance health-care directive. (NRS
46 162A.700-162A.870) Section 14 of this bill establishes an alternative form to create an
47 advance health-care directive. Sections 15, 16 and 24-30 of this bill make conforming
48 changes to reference the alternative form.
49 Section 18 of this bill authorizes a trustee to make an outright distribution to a
50 beneficiary without requiring the trustee to first create a new trust under certain
51 circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that certain
52 terms apply to the outright distribution.
53 Section 20 of this bill grants a trustee the power to reimburse a settlor for tax
54 payments. Section 21 of this bill requires certain documentation to be provided to
55 beneficiaries of a trust. Section 22 of this bill specifies the circumstances under which the
56 laws of this State govern the administration of a trust. Section 23 of this bill provides for
57 the circumstances under which an account must be deemed approved and final by a
58 trust adviser or trust protector.
59 Section 32 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which set forth a
60 preference for relatives of the whole blood over relatives of the half blood for certain
61 purposes relating to the administration of an estate.

38 person, the personal representative shall make the full inventory without redaction

42 identify the assets of an estate and the value thereof that is subject to probate
43 administration, including, without limitation, requiring the personal representative
44 to submit an inventory to the court in camera, as the court deems necessary and

53 estate, enter an order for a summary administration of the estate.

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 9
1 Sec. 7. NRS 145.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 145.110 If at any time after the entry of an order for the summary
3 administration of an estate it appears that the gross value of the estate, after
4 deducting any encumbrances, exceeds [$300,000] $500,000 as of the death of the
5 decedent, the personal representative shall petition the court for an order revoking
6 summary administration. The court may, if deemed advisable considering the
7 nature, character and obligations of the estate, provide in its order revoking
8 summary administration that regular administration of the estate may proceed
9 unabated upon providing such portions of the regular proceedings and notices as
10 were dispensed with by the order for summary administration.
11 Sec. 8. NRS 146.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 146.020 1. The court, on its own motion or upon petition by an interested
13 person, may, if deemed advisable considering the needs and resources of the
14 surviving spouse, minor child or minor children, set apart for the use of the
15 surviving spouse, minor child or minor children of the decedent all of the personal
16 property which is exempt by law from execution, and shall, in accordance with
17 NRS 146.050, set apart the homestead, as designated by the general homestead law
18 then in force, whether the homestead has theretofore previously been selected as
19 required by law or not, and the property thus set apart is not subject to
20 administration.
21 2. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1, the remaining
22 assets of the estate do not exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and may be set aside
23 without administration pursuant to NRS 146.070, the court shall set aside the
24 remaining assets of the estate without administration pursuant to the procedure set
25 forth in NRS 146.070. The court may consider at the same time a petition made
26 pursuant to subsection 1 and a petition to set aside the remaining assets of the estate
27 without administration pursuant to NRS 146.070.
28 3. If, after setting apart the property pursuant to subsection 1, the remaining
29 assets of the estate exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and may not be set aside without
30 administration pursuant to NRS 146.070, the court shall administer the remaining
31 assets of the estate pursuant to this title as if the remaining assets of the estate are
32 the only assets of the estate. If the petition to set apart property pursuant to
33 subsection 1 is made in the initial petition, the court shall consider only the value of
34 the remaining assets of the estate not set apart pursuant to subsection 1 for the
35 purpose of ordering summary administration pursuant to chapter 145 of NRS.
36 Sec. 9. NRS 146.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 146.070 1. All or part of the estate of a decedent may be set aside without
38 administration by the order of the court as follows:
39 (a) If the value of a decedent’s estate does not exceed [$100,000,] $150,000,
40 the estate may be set aside without administration by the order of the court; or
41 (b) If a decedent’s will directs that all or part of the decedent’s estate is to be
42 distributed to the trustee of a nontestamentary trust established by the decedent and
43 in existence at the decedent’s death, the portion of the estate subject to such
44 direction may be set aside without administration. Any portion of a decedent’s
45 estate set aside to the nontestamentary trust pursuant to this paragraph is subject to
46 creditors of the estate unless the petitioner provides proof to the court that the
47 trustee has published or mailed the requisite notice to such creditors on behalf of
48 the nontestamentary trust and settlor pursuant to NRS 164.025.
49 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the whole estate set aside
50 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 must be assigned and set apart in the
51 following order:
52 (a) To the payment of the petitioner’s attorney’s fees and costs incurred
53 relative to the proceeding under this section;

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 10
1 (b) To the payment of funeral expenses, expenses of last illness, money owed
2 to the Department of Health and Human Services as a result of payment of benefits
3 for Medicaid and creditors, if there are any;
4 (c) To the payment of other creditors, if any; and
5 (d) Any balance remaining to the claimant or claimants entitled thereto
6 pursuant to a valid will of the decedent, and if there is no valid will, pursuant to
7 intestate succession in accordance with chapter 134 of NRS.
8 3. If the value of the estate does not exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and the
9 decedent is survived by a spouse or one or more minor children, the court must set
10 aside the estate for the benefit of the surviving spouse or the minor child or minor
11 children of the decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or
12 5. The court may allocate the entire estate to the surviving spouse, the entire
13 amount to the minor child or minor children, or may divide the estate among the
14 surviving spouse and minor child or minor children.
15 4. As to any amount set aside to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or
16 minor child or minor children of the decedent pursuant to subsection 3, the court
17 must set aside the estate without the payment of creditors except as the court finds
18 necessary to prevent a manifest injustice.
19 5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are nonprobate transfers that
20 already benefit the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children of the
21 decedent, the court has the discretion to reduce the amount set aside under
22 subsection 3 to the extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value

47 PART 1
48
49 1. DESIGNATION OF HEALTH CARE AGENT
50
51 I, .............................................................................................................
52 (name of person signing), do hereby designate and appoint:

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 22
1 Name: ..............................................................................................
2 Address: ...........................................................................................
3 Phone number: .................................. Email: ..............................
4
5 as my agent to make health care decisions for me as authorized in this
6 document.
7
8 (Insert the name and address of the person you wish to designate as
9 your agent to make health care decisions for you. Unless the person is
10 also your spouse, your legal guardian or the person most closely related
11 to you by blood, none of the following may be designated as your agent:
12 (1) your treating provider of health care; (2) an employee of your treating
13 provider of health care; (3) an operator of a health care facility; or (4) an
14 employee of an operator of a health care facility.)
15
16 2. NAMING AN ALTERNATE AGENT
17
18 I want the following persons in the order listed to make health care
19 decisions for me if I cannot do so and my agent is not willing, able or
20 reasonably available to make them for me:

22 1st Alternate Agent:

30 Phone number: ................................... Email: ..............................
31
32 3. CREATION OF DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR
33 HEALTH CARE
34
35 By this document I intend to create a durable power of attorney by
36 appointing the person designated above to make health care decisions for
37 me. This power of attorney shall not be affected by my subsequent
38 incapacity. My goal is to reduce the intervention of a court in my affairs
39 by allowing for care without the need for guardianship.
40
41 By signing this document, I revoke any prior durable power of
42 attorney for health care that I may have made.
43
44 If my designated agent is my spouse or is one of my children, then I
45 waive any conflict of interest in carrying out the provisions of this
46 Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care that said spouse or child may
47 have by reason of the fact that he or she may be a beneficiary of my
48 estate.
49
50 4. GENERAL STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY GRANTED
51
52 In the event that I am incapable of giving informed consent with
53 respect to health care decisions, I hereby grant to the agent named above

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 23
1 full power and authority to make health care decisions for me before or
2 after my death, including consent, refusal of consent or withdrawal of
3 consent to any care, treatment, service or procedure to maintain,
4 diagnose or treat a physical or mental condition; to request, review and
5 receive any information, verbal or written, regarding my physical or
6 mental health, including, without limitation, medical and hospital
7 records; to execute on my behalf any releases or other documents that
8 may be required to obtain medical care and/or medical and hospital
9 records, EXCEPT any power to enter into any arbitration agreements or
10 execute any arbitration clauses in connection with admission to any
11 health care facility, including any skilled nursing facility; and subject
12 only to the limitations and special provisions, if any, set forth below.
13
14 PART 2: HEALTH CARE INSTRUCTION
15
16 This part lets you state your limitations and priorities for health care
17 and the types of health care you do or do not want.
18
19 I give my agent the power to make all health care decisions for me if I
20 cannot make those decisions for myself, except for the following:
21 ............................................ or as set forth below.
22
23 INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT. This
24 section gives you the opportunity to say how you want your agent to act
25 while making decisions for you. You may mark or initial each item or
26 leave any item blank.
27
28 Prolonging life vs. dying a natural death
29
30 1. ( ) I desire that my life be prolonged to the greatest extent
31 possible without regard to my condition, the chances I have for
32 recovery or long-term survival, or the cost of the procedures. In
33 other words, keep my body alive even if my doctors have
34 reasonably concluded that there is no reasonable hope for long-
35 term recovery or survival or that my coma (if I am in one) is
36 irreversible. If you select this choice, do not initial choices 2, 3, 4
37 or 5, as those are inconsistent with this choice.
38
39 2. ( ) If I am in a coma which my doctors have reasonably
40 concluded is irreversible, I desire that life-sustaining or
41 prolonging treatments not be used.
42
43 3. ( ) If I have an incurable or terminal condition or illness and
44 no reasonable hope of long-term recovery or survival, I desire
45 that life-sustaining or prolonging treatments not be used.
46
47 4. ( ) I have reviewed the Nevada POLST form (sample attached
48 hereto as Exhibit 1). If in the future I have not executed a POLST
49 form and my physician determines, or my agent suspects, that
50 execution of a POLST is appropriate, then my agent is authorized
51 to execute a POLST on my behalf in accordance with my wishes
52 stated in this, my Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 24
1 GI feeding tube or IV. I understand that withholding or withdrawal of
2 artificial nutrition and hydration may result in death by starvation or
3 dehydration. For some people this may be a tenet of their religion. For
4 some people it may not make sense to continue this when all other
5 treatment (machines) is terminated.
6
7 5. ( ) I do not want continued artificial nutrition and hydration
8 (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or intravenous liquids) after all
9 other treatment is terminated.
10
11 6. ( ) I do want continued artificial nutrition and hydration (e.g.
12 gastrointestinal feeding tube or intravenous liquids) after all
13 other treatment is terminated. If I initial this section, you are
14 asked to continue to give me the artificial nutrition and hydration.
15
16 7. ( ) I understand that continued artificial nutrition and
17 hydration (e.g. gastrointestinal feeding tube or intravenous
18 liquids) will likely occur if my physician reasonably believes that
19 providing such will lead to my recovery. However, I do not want to
20 continue to receive artificial nutrition and hydration if it is
21 expected to continue for the rest of my life.
22
23 Experimental procedures, treatments and drugs. I understand that it can
24 take a long time to obtain FDA approval for new medical procedures,
25 treatments and drugs. As a result, many are categorized as
26 “experimental.” I also understand that some of such procedures,
27 treatments or drugs have a good record of success and that some contain
28 risks. I also understand that experimental procedures, treatments and
29 drugs can only be given to me if I authorize them.
30
31 8. ( ) I authorize my agent to enroll me in experimental
32 procedures or treatments if said procedures or treatments are
33 recommended by my physician and my agent consents. My agent
34 is to consider the relief of suffering, the preservation or
35 restoration of functioning, and the quality as well as the extent of
36 the possible extension of my life in making that decision. My
37 agent is to consider whether the expected benefits outweigh the
38 burdens of the treatment or drug.
39
40 9. ( ) I do not want any experimental procedures, treatments or
41 drugs.
42
43 Palliative care (Dying with dignity/Use of pain relieving drugs)
44
45 10. ( ) When I die, I wish to do so with dignity and grace and
46 without pain and suffering. If I have an incurable or terminal
47 condition, including but not limited to late stage dementia, and no
48 reasonable hope of long-term recovery or survival, I desire my
49 attending physician to administer any medication to alleviate
50 suffering without regard to the fact that the medication may be
51 addictive or may reduce the extension of my life.

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 25
1 11. ( ) I do not wish to have any medication that may be addictive
2 or reduce the extension of my life.
3
4 Assisted living or other facility
5
6 12. ( ) I desire to live in my home for as long as it is safe and my
7 medical needs can be met. My agent may arrange for a natural
8 person, employee of an agency or provider of community-based
9 services to come into my home to provide care for me. When it is
10 no longer safe for me to live in my home, I authorize my agent to
11 place me in a facility or home that can provide any medical
12 assistance and support in my activities of daily living that I
13 require. Before being placed in such a facility or home, I wish for
14 my agent to discuss and share information concerning the
15 placement with me, and allow me to participate in the choice of
16 said facility or home. If I am married, placement shall be done in
17 a manner that considers my spouse’s support needs.
18
19 13. ( ) I refuse to be placed in any assisted living or other care
20 facility. I understand that, before I may be placed in a facility or
21 home other than the home in which I currently reside, a guardian
22 must be appointed for me, which means that a court action would
23 be needed to remove me from my home.
24
25 ( ) Other (write what you want or do not want):
26 .................................................................................................................
27
28 INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT PRIORITIES
29
30 You can use this section to provide any other information about your
31 goals, values and preferences for treatment, including care you want or
32 do not want. To the extent that you make entries in this section, this
33 information is for your agent and is not intended to limit or impair the
34 physician’s determination of a course of treatment, nor to subject the
35 physician to legal claims. You can also use this section to name anyone
36 whom you do not want to make decisions for you under any conditions.
37 (Insert such priorities, if any.)
38 .......................................................................................................................
39 .......................................................................................................................
40
41 PART 3: OPTIONAL SPECIAL POWERS AND GUIDANCE
42
43 This part allows you to give your agent additional powers and to provide
44 your agent with more guidance about your wishes. You may mark or
45 initial each item. You also may leave any item blank.
46
47 Mental health care or cognitive rehabilitation
48
49 14. ( ) I authorize my agent to admit me as a voluntary patient to
50 a facility for mental health or place me in rehabilitative care if my
51 agent determines such treatment is best for my health and safety,
52 or if it is recommended by a physician.

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 26
1 15. ( ) I do not authorize my agent to admit me as a voluntary
2 patient to a facility for mental health or place me in rehabilitative
3 care even if my agent determines such treatment is best for my
4 health and safety, or even if it is recommended by a physician.
5
6 ACCESS TO MY HEALTH INFORMATION (HIPAA). I give my
7 agent permission to examine and share information about my health
8 needs and health care if I am not able to make decisions for myself. By
9 signing this form, I give the authorization and full release of information
10 by any government agency, medical provider, business, creditor or third
11 party who may have information pertaining to my health care to my agent
12 named herein, pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and
13 Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, as amended, and
14 applicable regulations.
15
16 GUIDANCE FOR MY AGENT. The instructions I have stated in this
17 document should guide my agent in making decisions for me. (Initial or
18 mark one of the items below to tell your agent more about how to use
19 these instructions.):
20
21 16. ( ) I give my agent permission to be flexible in applying these
22 instructions if he or she thinks it would be in my best interest
23 based on what they know about me and the recommendations of
24 the attending physician.
25
26 17. ( ) I want my agent to follow these instructions exactly as
27 written if possible, even if he or she thinks something else is
28 better.
29
30 GOOD FAITH CARE. My wish is that the provider of health care
31 work cooperatively with me and my agent for my care. To that end, a
32 provider of health care who relies in good faith on the provisions of this
33 advance health-care directive shall be immune from criminal and civil
34 liability applicable to the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining
35 treatment. As such, the liability protection provisions already in law in
36 NRS 449A.727 shall apply whether or not this advance health-care
37 directive is retrieved from the Registry established by the Nevada
38 Secretary of State.
39
40 NOMINATION OF GUARDIAN. A guardian is a person appointed
41 by a court to make decisions for someone who cannot make decisions.
42 Filling this out does NOT mean you want or need a guardian right now.
43
44 If a court appoints a guardian to make personal decisions for me, I want
45 the court to choose my agent named in this form. If my agent cannot be a
46 guardian, I want my alternate agent(s) in the order named in this form. If
47 I prefer someone other than the agent(s) named in this form, their name
48 and contact information is: ..........................................................................

50 .......................................................................................................................
51
52 AMENDMENT; RIGHT TO TERMINATE. This durable power of
53 attorney may be amended. This document shall not be terminated by

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 27
1 anyone other than me and it shall not be terminated by a governmental
2 entity, including a court.

4 PART 4: ORGAN DONATION
5
6 This part allows you to donate your organs when you die. You may
7 mark or initial each item. You also may leave any item blank.

31 PART 5: CHALLENGES
32
33 If the legality of any provision of this Durable Power of Attorney for
34 Health Care is questioned by my physician, my advanced practice
35 registered nurse, my agent or a third party, then my agent is authorized to

37 provision in question. The cost of any such action is to be paid from my

7 apply to any power of attorney containing the authority to make health care
8 decisions.
9 Sec. 16. NRS 162A.710 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 162A.710 As used in NRS 162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive, and section 14
11 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in
12 NRS 162A.715 to 162A.780, inclusive, and section 14 of this act have the
13 meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
14 Sec. 17. NRS 162B.510 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 162B.510 1. Appointive property subject to a general power of appointment
16 created by a person other than the powerholder is not subject to a claim of any
17 creditor, unless the power of appointment was held by a decedent who actually
18 exercised the power in favor of the decedent or the decedent’s estate pursuant to
19 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 12 of NRS 111.779.
20 2. Subject to subsection 3 of NRS 162B.530, a power of appointment created
21 by a person other than the powerholder which is subject to an ascertainable
22 standard relating to an individual’s health, education, support or maintenance
23 within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. § 2041(b)(1)(A) or 26 U.S.C. § 2514(c)(1), as

27 section to read as follows:
28 1. Unless specifically prohibited by the terms of a will or trust instrument
29 and except as provided in subsection 2, if an instrument creating a separate trust
30 requires the assets of the separate trust to be distributed to the beneficiary or
31 beneficiaries of the trust immediately after the establishment of the separate trust
32 as a result of the circumstances existing at the time the separate trust is to be
33 established, the executor, trustee or any other party having possession of the
34 property with which the separate trust will be funded may exercise discretion to
35 make a distribution directly to the beneficiary or the beneficiaries of the separate
36 trust.
37 2. An executor, trustee or any other party described in subsection 1 may
38 exercise discretion rather than distributing the trust assets to the trustee of the
39 separate trust if the transferring executor, trustee or any other party described in
40 subsection 1 and the trustee of the separate trust are the same person.
41 3. The receipts of distribution provided to any beneficiary or beneficiaries
42 in the manner described in this section shall be deemed to protect the executor,
43 trustee or other person having possession of the property to the same extent that a
44 receipt of distribution would have protected the executor, trustee or other person
45 had the property been distributed by the trustee from the separate trust.
46 Sec. 19. NRS 163.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:

4 a corporate as well as a natural person and a successor or substitute trustee.
5 Sec. 20. NRS 163.557 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 163.557 1. A governing trust instrument may authorize the trustee, in the
7 sole discretion of the trustee or at the direction or with the consent of a directing
8 trust adviser, to reimburse a settlor for all or a portion of tax on trust income or
9 principal that is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax. In the sole
10 discretion of the trustee, the trustee may pay such amount to the settlor directly or
11 to an appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the settlor.
12 2. [A trustee or directing trust adviser] Except as expressly prohibited or
13 otherwise provided under the trust instrument, if all or any portion of the trust is
14 treated as being owned by a person under section 671 of the Internal Revenue
15 Code or any similar federal, state or other tax law, in addition to any such
16 discretion conferred under the terms of a trust instrument, the trustee may, in the
17 trustee’s sole discretion, reimburse the person being treated as the owner for any
18 amount of the person’s federal, state or other income tax liability that is
19 attributable to the inclusion of the trust’s income, capital gains, deductions or
20 credits in the calculation of the person’s taxable income. In the trustee’s sole
21 discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement amount, determined
22 without regard to any other distribution or payment made from trust assets, to the
23 person directly or to the appropriate taxing authority. A life insurance policy held
24 in the trust, the cash value of any such policy or the proceeds of any loan secured
25 by an interest in the policy may not be used for such reimbursement or payment if
26 the person is an insured.
27 3. Except as otherwise provided under the trust instrument, a trustee who
28 exercises discretion to make, consent to or direct the decision to reimburse the
29 settlor under subsection 1 or 2 is not liable to any person in exercising such
30 discretion to reimburse or not reimburse a settlor for tax payable by the settlor on
31 trust income or principal pursuant to subsection 1.
32 [3.] 4. A trustee may not exercise or participate in the exercise of the
33 powers granted by this section with respect to any trust if the trustee is:
34 (a) Treated as the owner of all or part of the trust under section 671 of the
35 Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state or other tax law;
36 (b) A beneficiary of the trust; or
37 (c) A related or subordinate party, as defined in section 672(c) of the Internal
38 Revenue Code, with respect to:
39 (1) A person treated as the owner of all or part of the trust under section
40 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state or other tax law;
41 or
42 (2) A beneficiary of the trust.
43 5. If the trust instrument requires the trustee to act at the direction or with
44 the consent of a trust adviser, trust protector or any other person, or that the
45 reimbursement decisions permitted by this section be made directly by a trust
46 adviser, trust protector or any other person, the powers granted by subsection 1
47 and the provisions of subsection 2 applicable to the trustee are instead also
48 granted or apply, subject to the trust instrument, to the trust adviser, trust
49 protector or other person subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 3,
50 which must be applied as if the trust adviser, trust protector or other person were
51 a trustee.
52 6. The power of a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any other person
53 to make a payment to or for the benefit of a settlor or other person in accordance

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 31
1 with subsection 1 or 2 or the decision of a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or
2 any other person to exercise such power in favor of the settlor must not cause the
3 settlor or other person to be treated as a beneficiary for purposes of the laws of this
4 State [.] solely by reason of the application of this section. As used in this
5 subsection, “beneficiary” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 163.4147.
6 7. This section applies to all trusts described in subsection 2 that are
7 governed by the laws of this State or have a principal place of administration
8 within this State whether created before, on or after October 1, 2025, unless:
9 (a) At least 60 days before the effective date of such election, the trustee
10 provides written notice that the trustee intends to irrevocably elect out of the
11 application of this section to:
12 (1) The person treated as the owner of all or a portion of the trust under
13 section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state or other
14 tax law; and
15 (2) All persons who have the ability to remove and replace the trustee
16 under the terms of the trust instrument.
17 (b) Applying the discretion conferred under subsection 1 will prevent a
18 contribution to the trust from qualifying for or reducing a federal tax benefit,
19 including a federal tax exclusion or deduction, that was originally claimed or
20 could have been claimed for the contribution, including:
21 (1) An exclusion under section 2503(b) or 2503(c) of the Internal
22 Revenue Code;
23 (2) A marital deduction under section 2056, 2056A or 2523 of the
24 Internal Revenue Code;
25 (3) A charitable deduction under section 170(a), 642(c), 2055(a) or
26 2522(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
27 (4) Direct skip treatment under section 2642(c) of the Internal Revenue
28 Code.
29 Sec. 21. NRS 164.021 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 164.021 1. When a revocable trust becomes irrevocable because of the
31 death of a settlor or by the express terms of the trust, the trustee may, after the trust
32 becomes irrevocable, provide notice to any beneficiary of the irrevocable trust, any
33 heir of the settlor or to any other interested person.
34 2. The notice provided by the trustee must contain:
35 (a) The identity of the settlor of the trust and the date of execution of the trust
36 instrument . [;]

38 . [;]
39 (c) The dispositive provisions of the trust instrument which pertain to the
40 beneficiary, a complete copy of the trust instrument or notice that the heir or
41 interested person is not a beneficiary under the trust [;] . As used in this paragraph,
42 “trust instrument” means only those amendments, restatements and instruments
43 the trustee has determined to be in effect at the time of the death of the settlor
44 after the trustee has exercised due diligence.
45 (d) Any information required to be included in the notice expressly provided
46 by the trust instrument . [; and]
47 (e) A statement set forth in a separate paragraph, in 12-point boldface type or
48 an equivalent type which states: “You may not bring an action to contest the trust
49 more than 120 days from the date this notice is provided to you.”
50 3. The trustee shall cause notice pursuant to this section to be provided in
51 accordance with the provisions of NRS 155.010.
52 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person upon whom
53 notice is provided pursuant to this section may bring an action to contest the

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 32
1 validity of the trust more than 120 days from the date the notice is served upon the
2 person, unless the person proves that he or she did not receive actual notice. A
3 person upon whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may provide consent
4 in writing to a period of less than 120 days in which the person may bring an action
5 to contest the validity of the trust.
6 5. [For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection 2, a copy of the trust
7 instrument shall be considered complete if it includes all amendments and
8 restatements to the trust instrument the trustee has determined to be in effect at the
9 time of the death of the settlor after the trustee has exercised due diligence.
10 6.] A trustee is not liable in providing information pursuant to paragraph (c)
11 of subsection 2 to any person whom the trustee has determined, after the exercise of
12 due diligence, to be a beneficiary, heir or interested person.
13 6. A person may waive the right to notice contemplated by this section by
14 delivering to the trustee a waiver signed by the person, which shall be deemed
15 irrevocable. Upon delivery of such a waiver to the trustee, the person who waived
16 the right to notice is precluded from bringing any action to contest the validity of
17 the trust.
18 Sec. 22. NRS 164.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 164.045 1. The laws of this State govern the validity and construction of a
20 trust if:
21 (a) The trust instrument so provides;
22 (b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust instrument, has
23 the right to designate the laws that govern the validity and construction of the trust,
24 at the time the designation is made; or

35 State is valid whether or not the trust complies with the laws of this State at the

38 (a) The trust instrument so provides; or
39 (b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust instrument or
40 applicable law, has the right to designate the laws that govern the administration
41 of the trust, at the time the designation is made.
42 5. Notwithstanding a general choice of law provision in the governing
43 instrument of a trust, such as a provision in the governing instrument to the
44 effect that the laws of a jurisdiction other than this State govern the trust or the
45 administration of the trust, the laws of this State govern the administration of the
46 trust while the trust is administered in this State, as provided in subsection 7 or as
47 otherwise provided, unless:
48 (a) The governing instrument expressly provides that the laws of another
49 jurisdiction govern the administration of the trust and that the laws governing the

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 33

4 this State, the fiduciary’s liability under the governing instrument for the action
5 or inaction must be determined in accordance with the laws of the foreign
6 jurisdiction.

8 a trust may be considered to be administered in this State, a trust is considered to
9 be administered in this State if all or part of the administration occurs in this

11 (a) The sole trustee is an individual residing in this State or a corporation or
12 other entity having an office in this State for the conduct of business;

29 NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE
30
31 Under Nevada law, a person may use this advance directive to provide
32 consent or refuse to consent to future psychiatric care if the person later
33 becomes incapable of making or communicating those decisions. By
34 executing a durable power of attorney for health care as set forth in NRS
35 162A.700 to 162A.870, inclusive, and section 14 of this act, the person
36 may also appoint an agent to make decisions regarding psychiatric care for
37 the person when incapable. A person is “incapable” for the purposes of this
38 advance directive when in the opinion of two providers of health care, one
39 of whom must be a physician or licensed psychologist and the other of
40 whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed psychologist, a
41 psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who has the
42 psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
43 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, the person currently lacks sufficient
44 understanding or capacity to make or communicate decisions regarding
45 psychiatric care. If a person is determined to be incapable, the person may
46 be found capable when, in the opinion of the person’s attending physician
47 or an advanced practice registered nurse who has the psychiatric training
48 and experience prescribed by the State Board of Nursing pursuant to NRS
49 632.120 and has an established relationship with the person, the person has
50 regained sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate
51 decisions regarding psychiatric care. This document becomes effective
52 upon its proper execution and remains valid for a period of 2 years after the
53 date of its execution unless revoked. Upon being presented with this

Senate Amendment No. 258 to Senate Bill No. 404 Page 37
1 advance directive, the physician or other provider of health care must make
2 it a part of the person’s medical record. The physician or other provider
3 must act in accordance with the statements expressed in the advance
4 directive when the person is determined to be incapable, except as
5 otherwise provided in NRS 449A.636. The physician or other provider shall
6 promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the agent of the principal,
7 and document in the principal’s medical record any act or omission that is
8 not in compliance with any part of an advance directive. A physician or
9 other provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated
10 and notarized advance directive.
11
12 ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR PSYCHIATRIC CARE
13
14 I, .............................., being an adult of sound mind or an emancipated
15 minor, willfully and voluntarily make this advance directive for psychiatric
16 care to be followed if it is determined by two providers of health care, one
17 of whom must be my attending physician or a licensed psychologist and the
18 other of whom must be a physician, a physician assistant, a licensed
19 psychologist, a psychiatrist or an advanced practice registered nurse who
20 has the psychiatric training and experience prescribed by the State Board of
21 Nursing pursuant to NRS 632.120, that my ability to receive and evaluate
22 information effectively or communicate decisions is impaired to such an
23 extent that I lack the capacity to refuse or consent to psychiatric care. I
24 understand that psychiatric care may not be administered without my
25 express and informed consent or, if I am incapable of giving my informed
26 consent, the express and informed consent of my legally responsible
27 person, my agent named pursuant to a valid durable power of attorney for
28 health care or my consent expressed in this advance directive for
29 psychiatric care. I understand that I may become incapable of giving or
30 withholding informed consent or refusal for psychiatric care due to the
31 symptoms of a diagnosed mental disorder. These symptoms may include:
32
33 PSYCHOACTIVE MEDICATIONS
34
35 If I become incapable of giving or withholding informed consent for
36 psychiatric care, my instructions regarding psychoactive medications are as
37 follows: (Place initials beside choice.)

52 choice.)
