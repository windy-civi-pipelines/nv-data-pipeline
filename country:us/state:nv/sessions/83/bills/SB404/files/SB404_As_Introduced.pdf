4 this bill provides that a person may be legally qualified to serve as an administrator
5 upon a finding of good cause based on certain evidence. Existing law establishes
6 the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which allows a personal
7 representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a decedent without court
8 supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill requires a personal
9 representative who otherwise meets the criteria to be legally qualified as an
10 administrator of an intestate estate to provide certain evidence to the court. Existing
11 law authorizes any interested person to petition for modification or revocation of
12 the authority of a personal representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill
13 requires the court, when determining whether to revoke the authority of a personal
14 representative, to give preference to any interested person based on the order of
15 priority set forth for the appointment of an administrator for an intestate estate.
