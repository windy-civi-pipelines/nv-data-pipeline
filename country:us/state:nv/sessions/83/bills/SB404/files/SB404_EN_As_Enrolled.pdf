Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law governs the administration of trusts and estates. (Titles 12 and 13
of NRS) Sections 1, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 4, 5, 11 and 17 of this bill revise certain terms
and make technical corrections relating to the administration of trusts and estates.
Existing law sets forth an order of priority for the appointment of an
administrator to administrate the intestate estate of a decedent and authorizes any
person legally qualified to serve as the administrator. (NRS 139.040) Section 1.2 of
this bill: (1) revises the order of priority for the appointment of an administrator to
administrate the intestate estate of a decedent; (2) provides that a person may be
legally qualified to serve as an administrator upon a finding of good cause based on
certain evidence; and (3) authorizes the court to appoint certain persons under
certain circumstances. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to an
internal reference caused by the revisions relating to the order of priority and
appointment in section 1.2. Section 1.4 of this bill authorizes a court to appoint one
or more persons to serve as personal representative or appoint an independent
representative under certain circumstances.
Existing law establishes the Independent Administration of Estates Act, which
allows a personal representative to administer most aspects of the estate of a
decedent without court supervision. (NRS 143.300-143.815) Section 2 of this bill
provides that only a personal representative who is named in the will or certain
other persons who meet the criteria to be legally qualified as an administrator of an
intestate estate may administer an estate. Existing law authorizes any interested
person to petition for modification or revocation of the authority of a personal
representative. (NRS 143.360) Section 3 of this bill requires the court, when
determining whether to revoke the authority of a personal representative, to give
preference to any interested person based on the order of priority set forth for the
appointment of an administrator for an intestate estate.
Under existing law, a court is authorized to enter an order for the summary
administration of an estate if the court deems summary administration advisable
and the gross value of the estate does not exceed $300,000, after deducting any
-

– 2 –
encumbrances. (NRS 145.040) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill increase that amount to
$500,000.
Sections 8 and 9 of this bill increase the monetary amount for an estate to be
set aside without administration from $100,000 to $150,000. Section 10 of this bill
makes a conforming change to similarly increase the affidavit of entitlement limit
for a surviving spouse.
Existing law requires certain civil actions to recover damages from another
person to be commenced within certain periods. (NRS 11.190) Section 12 of this
bill provides that an action against certain persons based on a breach of fiduciary
duty, not involving fraud or intentional misrepresentation, must be commenced
within 2 years.
Section 18 of this bill authorizes a trustee to make an outright distribution to a
beneficiary without requiring the trustee to first create a new trust under certain
circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that
certain terms apply to the outright distribution.
Section 20 of this bill grants a trustee the power to reimburse a settlor for tax
payments. Section 21 of this bill requires certain documentation to be provided to
beneficiaries of a trust. Section 22 of this bill specifies the circumstances under
which the laws of this State govern the administration of a trust. Section 23 of this
bill provides for the circumstances under which an account must be deemed
approved and final by a trust adviser or trust protector.
Section 32 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which set forth a
preference for relatives of the whole blood over relatives of the half blood for
certain purposes relating to the administration of an estate.

132.115 “Distributee” means a person who has received , or
has the right to receive, property of a decedent from the decedent’s
personal representative other than as a creditor or purchaser. A

assets or increment thereto remaining in his or her hands. A
beneficiary of a testamentary trust to whom the trustee has
distributed property received from a personal representative is a
distributee of the personal representative. As used in this section,
“testamentary trustee” includes a trustee to whom assets are
transferred by will to the extent of the devised assets.
Sec. 1.1. NRS 136.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:

the remaining assets of the estate exceed [$100,000] $150,000 and
may not be set aside without administration pursuant to NRS
146.070, the court shall administer the remaining assets of the estate

such creditors on behalf of the nontestamentary trust and settlor

decedent, subject to any reduction made pursuant to subsection 4 or

prevent a manifest injustice.
5. To prevent an injustice to creditors when there are
nonprobate transfers that already benefit the surviving spouse or
minor child or minor children of the decedent, the court has the
discretion to reduce the amount set aside under subsection 3 to the
extent that the value of the estate, when combined with the value of
nonprobate transfers, as defined in NRS 111.721, from the decedent
to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
children of the decedent exceeds [$100,000.] $150,000.
6. In exercising the discretion granted in this section, the court
shall consider the needs and resources of the surviving spouse and
minor child or minor children, including any assets received by or
for the benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor
children from the decedent by nonprobate transfers.
7. For the purpose of this section, a nonprobate transfer from
the decedent to one or more trusts or custodial accounts for the
benefit of the surviving spouse or minor child or minor children

separate trust is to be established, the executor, trustee or any
other party having possession of the property with which the
separate trust will be funded may exercise discretion to make a
distribution directly to the beneficiary or the beneficiaries of the
separate trust.
-
83rd Session (2025)

the trustee of the separate trust are the same person.
3. The receipts of distribution provided to any beneficiary or
beneficiaries in the manner described in this section shall be

separate trust.
Sec. 19. NRS 163.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:

trustee, in the sole discretion of the trustee or at the direction or with
the consent of a directing trust adviser, to reimburse a settlor for all
or a portion of tax on trust income or principal that is payable by the
settlor under the law imposing such tax. In the sole discretion of the
trustee, the trustee may pay such amount to the settlor directly or to
an appropriate taxing authority on behalf of the settlor.
2. [A trustee or directing trust adviser] Except as expressly
prohibited or otherwise provided under the trust instrument, if all
or any portion of the trust is treated as being owned by a person
under section 671 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar
federal, state or other tax law, in addition to any such discretion

83rd Session (2025)

– 21 –
as the owner for any amount of the person’s federal, state or other
income tax liability that is attributable to the inclusion of the
trust’s income, capital gains, deductions or credits in the
calculation of the person’s taxable income. In the trustee’s sole
discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement amount,
determined without regard to any other distribution or payment
made from trust assets, to the person directly or to the appropriate
taxing authority. A life insurance policy held in the trust, the cash
value of any such policy or the proceeds of any loan secured by an
interest in the policy may not be used for such reimbursement or
payment if the person is an insured.
3. Except as otherwise provided under the trust instrument, a
trustee who exercises discretion to make, consent to or direct the
decision to reimburse the settlor under subsection 1 or 2 is not
liable to any person in exercising such discretion to reimburse or not
reimburse a settlor for tax payable by the settlor on trust income or
principal pursuant to subsection 1.

direction or with the consent of a trust adviser, trust protector or
any other person, or that the reimbursement decisions permitted
by this section be made directly by a trust adviser, trust protector
or any other person, the powers granted by subsection 1 and the
provisions of subsection 2 applicable to the trustee are instead also
granted or apply, subject to the trust instrument, to the trust
adviser, trust protector or other person subject to the limitations
set forth in subsection 3, which must be applied as if the trust
adviser, trust protector or other person were a trustee.

a trustee , trust adviser, trust protector or any other person to
exercise such power in favor of the settlor must not cause the settlor
or other person to be treated as a beneficiary for purposes of the

section. As used in this subsection, “beneficiary” has the meaning
ascribed to it in NRS 163.4147.
7. This section applies to all trusts described in subsection 2
that are governed by the laws of this State or have a principal

the trustee under the terms of the trust instrument.
(b) Applying the discretion conferred under subsection 2 will
prevent a contribution to the trust from qualifying for or reducing
a federal tax benefit, including a federal tax exclusion or
deduction, that was originally claimed or could have been claimed
for the contribution, including:
(1) An exclusion under section 2503(b) or 2503(c) of the
Internal Revenue Code;
(2) A marital deduction under section 2056, 2056A or 2523

expressly provided by the trust instrument . [; and]

provided in accordance with the provisions of NRS 155.010.
4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no person
upon whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may bring an
action to contest the validity of the trust more than 120 days from
the date the notice is served upon the person, unless the person
proves that he or she did not receive actual notice. A person upon
whom notice is provided pursuant to this section may provide
consent in writing to a period of less than 120 days in which the
person may bring an action to contest the validity of the trust.
5. [For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection 2, a copy of
the trust instrument shall be considered complete if it includes all
amendments and restatements to the trust instrument the trustee has
determined to be in effect at the time of the death of the settlor after
the trustee has exercised due diligence.
6.] A trustee is not liable in providing information pursuant to
paragraph (c) of subsection 2 to any person whom the trustee has
determined, after the exercise of due diligence, to be a beneficiary,
heir or interested person.
6. A person may waive the right to notice contemplated by
this section by delivering to the trustee a waiver signed by the
person, which shall be deemed irrevocable. Upon delivery of such
a waiver to the trustee, the person who waived the right to notice is
precluded from bringing any action to contest the validity of the
trust.
Sec. 22. NRS 164.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
164.045 1. The laws of this State govern the validity and

– 24 –
(b) Designated by a person who, under the terms of the trust
instrument, has the right to designate the laws that govern the

not made such a designation and the settlor or the trustee of the trust

while the trust is administered in this State, as provided in
subsection 7 or as otherwise provided, unless:
