EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring, under certain
circumstances, an insurer that requires the inspection or
further inspection of a motor vehicle for repair relating to
a claim to conduct the inspection or further inspection
within a certain period of time; providing an
administrative penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires: (1) with certain exceptions, an insurer to approve or deny
2 a claim of its insured relating to a contract of casualty of insurance within 30 days
3 after receiving the claim; and (2) an insurer to notify a policyholder within 20 days
4 after receiving the claim if the insurer requires additional information or time to
5 determine whether to approve or deny the claim. (NRS 690B.012)
6 Section 1 of this bill provides that if an insurer requires the inspection for
7 repair of a motor vehicle relating to a claim by the insured or a claimant, the insurer
8 shall, within 8 business days after receiving the claim and accepting liability: (1)
9 request that the insured, the claimant or a representative of the selected repair shop,
10 as applicable, make the motor vehicle available for inspection; and (2) with certain
11 exceptions, inspect the motor vehicle. The insurer is required, within 2 business
12 days after the inspection, to transmit the completed estimate which includes,
13 without limitation, an indication of the extent of known damages related to the
14 claim and manner of repair at the time of the inspection. Section 1 further provides
15 that if, in response to a request for a supplemental estimate, the insurer determines
16 that a motor vehicle requires further inspection, the insurer shall, within 8 business
17 days after making such determination: (1) request that the insured, the claimant or a
18 representative of the selected repair shop, as applicable, make the motor vehicle
19 available for inspection; and (2) with certain exceptions, inspect the motor vehicle.
20 The insurer is required, within 2 business days after the inspection, to transmit the
21 completed estimate which includes, without limitation, an indication of the extent
22 of known damages related to the claim and manner of repair at the time of the

23 inspection. If the insurer fails to inspect or further inspect the vehicle during the
24 time in which it is required to do so or fails to provide the required completed
25 estimate, the insurer waives its right to inspect or further inspect the vehicle and,
26 with certain exceptions, negotiations for payment of the claim are limited to the
27 cost of labor and price of parts. Finally, section 1 authorizes the Division of
28 Insurance of the Department of Business and Industry to impose an administrative
29 fine of not more than the actual damages or $1,200, whichever is less, for each
30 violation of section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 690B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. If an insurer requires the inspection for repair of a motor
4 vehicle relating to a claim by the insured or a claimant, the
5 insurer shall, within 8 business days after receiving the claim,
6 accepting liability and confirming coverage:
7 (a) Request that the insured, the claimant or a representative
8 of the selected repair shop, as applicable, make the motor vehicle
9 available for inspection; and
10 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, inspect the
11 motor vehicle.
12  Within 2 business days after an inspection, the insurer shall
13 transmit the completed estimate which includes, without
14 limitation, an indication of the extent of known damages related to
15 the claim and manner of repair.
16 2. If, in response to a request for a supplemental estimate, the
17 insurer determines that a motor vehicle requires further
18 inspection, the insurer shall, within 8 business days after making
19 such determination:
20 (a) Request that the insured, the claimant or a representative
21 of the selected repair shop, as applicable, make the motor vehicle
22 available for further inspection; and
23 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, conduct such
24 further inspection of the motor vehicle.
25  Within 2 business days after an inspection, the insurer shall
26 transmit the completed estimate which includes, without
27 limitation, an indication of the extent of known damages related to
28 the claim and manner of repair.
29 3. If the insured or claimant does not make a motor vehicle
30 available for inspection or further inspection within 8 business
31 days after receiving a request from the insurer pursuant to
32 subsection 1 or 2, the insurer shall inspect or further inspect the
-

– 3 –
1 vehicle as soon as practicable after the insured or claimant makes
2 the motor vehicle available.
3 4. If an insurer fails to inspect the motor vehicle during the
4 period required pursuant to subsection 1, 2 or 3, as applicable, or
5 fails to transmit the completed estimate required pursuant to
6 subsection 1 or 2, as applicable, the insurer waives its right to
7 inspect or further inspect the motor vehicle before any repairs are
8 made to the vehicle. Unless the repair facility or, as applicable, the
9 insured or claimant allows an inspection or further inspection of
10 the vehicle after the period required pursuant to subsection 1, 2 or
11 3, negotiations for payment of the claim are limited to the cost of
12 labor and the price of parts unless the insurer provides objective
13 evidence to dispute the existence of damage or the chosen manner
14 of repair.
15 5. The insured or claimant, as applicable, may file a
16 complaint against the insurer with the Division if the insurer
17 waives its right to inspect or further inspect the vehicle and does
18 not limit negotiations for payment of the claim to the cost of labor
19 and the price of parts or provide objective evidence to dispute the
20 existence of the damage or the chosen manner of repair.
21 6. The Division may impose against an insurer an
22 administrative fine of not more than the actual damages or $1,200,
23 whichever is less, for a violation of the provisions of this section.
24 7. As used in this section, “inspection” means:
25 (a) A physical inspection; or
26 (b) A digital inspection which includes, without limitation, the
27 provision of digital photographs, videos or any other digital
28 evidence through an electronic processing system authorized by an
29 insurer that conducts the inspection of a motor vehicle.
