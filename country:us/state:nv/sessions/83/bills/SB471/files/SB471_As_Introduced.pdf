SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing budgeting for public
education. (BDR 34-1160)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising the manner in which the
Governor is required to prepare the proposed executive
budget with respect to the support of the operation of
public schools; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Education Fund for the purpose of supporting the
2 operation of the public schools in this State and requires that certain tax and fee
3 revenues of the State be deposited in the Fund. In addition to these revenues
4 deposited in the State Education Fund, existing law requires support for the State
5 Education Fund to be provided by direct legislative appropriation from the State
6 General Fund in an amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to fund
7 the operation of the public schools in this State for the next ensuing biennium for
8 the population reasonably estimated for that biennium. (NRS 387.1212)
9 Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to ensure that in
10 the proposed executive budget an amount of money in the State General Fund is
11 reserved for transfer to the State Education Fund in an amount not less than the
12 amount transferred in the immediately preceding biennium: (1) plus the greater of
13 the increase in revenue collected for general, unrestricted uses as projected by the
14 Economic Forum or the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in
15 the public schools in this State in the previous biennium; or (2) decreased by an
16 amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue collected by the State
17 as projected by the Economic Forum. (NRS 387.12455) This bill removes the
18 requirement for the Governor to ensure that, under certain circumstances, the
19 proposed executive budget include an increase in the amount of money proposed to
20 be transferred from the State General Fund to the State Education Fund. Instead,

21 this bill requires the Governor to ensure that the proposed executive budget
22 includes a total amount of money in the State Education Fund, excluding the
23 Education Stabilization Account, that funds increases in the amount of money in
24 the State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, when
25 such an increase is required. This bill: (1) maintains the requirement that if the
26 Economic Forum projects that revenue collected by the State for general,
27 unrestricted uses will decrease, the amount of money transferred in the proposed
28 executive budget from the State General Fund to the State Education Fund may
29 decrease by not more than the percentage decrease projected by the Economic
30 Forum; and (2) provides that, under such circumstances, the Governor is not
31 required to ensure that the proposed executive budget satisfies requirements for
32 including an increase in the amount of money in the State Education Fund.
33 Existing law requires the Legislature, in funding the public schools in this
34 State, to determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year
35 of the biennium, which is the amount of money on a per pupil basis determined to
36 be sufficient to fund the costs, with certain exceptions, of all public schools in this
37 State. (NRS 387.1214) Existing law requires the Governor, as part of the proposed
38 executive budget, to include recommendations for the statewide base per pupil
39 funding amount, which must be equal to the statewide base per pupil funding
40 amount for the immediately preceding biennium increased by an amount not less
41 than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the public
42 schools, unless the amount of money contained in the State Education Fund,
43 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately
44 preceding biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a proportional
45 reduction of the statewide base per pupil funding amount. Additionally, the
46 Governor is also required to recommend a proportional reduction of the multiplier
47 for each category of pupil which must not be less than the multiplier for the
48 immediately preceding biennium, unless the amount of money in the State
49 Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases or
50 increases in an amount that is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category
51 of pupils. However, existing law authorizes the Governor to provide
52 recommendations which deviate from these requirements if the Governor
53 determines that it would be impracticable to prepare the proposed executive budget
54 in this manner. (NRS 387.12455) This bill continues the requirement for the
55 Governor to include, as part of the proposed executive budget, a recommendation
56 for the statewide base per pupil funding amount and the multiplier for weighted
57 funding, but eliminates provisions which prescribe how the Governor’s
58 recommendations must be calculated.
59 If the Governor makes recommendations for the funding of public schools
60 which deviate from the prescribed methods for preparing such recommendations,
61 on the basis that using such methods would be impracticable, existing law requires
62 the Governor to make recommendations for legislation to improve the method by
63 which funding for public schools is determined. (NRS 387.12455) This bill
64 eliminates the requirement for the Governor to make this recommendation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 387.12455 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 387.12455 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5,]

1 expenditures and revenues for the State Education Fund as
2 prescribed by the State Budget Act, the Governor shall, to the extent
3 practicable, ensure that [an amount of money in the State General
4 Fund is reserved in] the proposed executive budget [for transfer to]
5 includes an amount of money in the State Education Fund ,
6 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, which is sufficient
7 to [fully] fund [:
8 (a) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
9 the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is
10 greater than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of
11 enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
12 preceding biennium,] an amount of money in the [State General
13 Fund for transfer to the] State Education Fund for the subsequent
14 biennium which is not less than the amount of money [transferred
15 to] in the State Education Fund [from the State General Fund for] ,
16 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, for the
17 immediately preceding biennium increased by [an amount not less
18 than] the lower of:
19 (a) The rate of increase for the revenue collected by the State
20 for general, unrestricted uses as projected by the Economic Forum
21 [.] ; or
22 (b) [If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected
23 by the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that
24 is not greater than the] The combined rate of inflation and the
25 growth of enrollment in the public schools in this State in the
26 immediately preceding biennium . [, an amount of money in the
27 State General Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the
28 subsequent biennium which is not less than the amount of money
29 transferred to the State Education Fund from the State General Fund
30 for the immediately preceding biennium increased by an amount not
31 less than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment
32 in the public schools in this State.
33 (c) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
34 the State for general, unrestricted uses will decrease, an amount of
35 money in the State General Fund for transfer to the State Education
36 Fund for the subsequent biennium which is not less than the amount
37 of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the State
38 General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium decreased by
39 an amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue
40 collected by the State as projected by the Economic Forum.]
41 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [5, as] 6, the
42 Governor shall ensure that the amount of money included in the
43 proposed executive budget for transfer from the State General
44 Fund to the State Education Fund is not less than the amount of
45 money appropriated from the State General Fund to the State
-
*SB471*

– 4 –
1 Education Fund for the immediately preceding biennium unless
2 the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the
3 State for general, unrestricted use will decrease. If the Economic
4 Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for general,
5 unrestricted use will decrease:
6 (a) The amount of any decrease in the amount of money
7 transferred in the proposed executive budget from the State
8 General Fund to the State Education Fund must not exceed the
9 rate of decrease for the revenue collected by the State for general,
10 unrestricted use as projected by the Economic Forum; and
11 (b) The Governor is not required to ensure that the proposed
12 executive budget includes an amount of money in the State
13 Education Fund that complies with the provisions of subsection 1.
14 3. As part of the proposed executive budget, the Governor shall
15 [, to the extent practicable,] include recommendations for [:
16 (a) The] the statewide base per pupil funding amount [, which
17 must be equal to the statewide base per pupil funding amount for the
18 immediately preceding biennium increased by an amount not less
19 than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in
20 the public schools in this State unless the amount of money
21 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
22 Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately preceding
23 biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a
24 proportional reduction to both the statewide base per pupil funding
25 amount and the multiplier for each category of pupils pursuant to
26 paragraph (b);] and
27 [(b) The] the multiplier for weighted funding for each category
28 of pupils . [, which must not be less than the multiplier for the
29 immediately preceding biennium unless:
30 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
31 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
32 from the immediately preceding biennium, in which event the
33 Governor must recommend a proportional reduction to both the
34 statewide base per pupil funding amount pursuant to paragraph (a)
35 and the multiplier for each category of pupils; or
36 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
37 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
38 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after
39 recommending the statewide base per pupil funding amount
40 pursuant to paragraph (a), is insufficient to fund the multiplier for
41 each category of pupils, in which event the Governor must
42 recommend the remaining money in the State Education Fund,
43 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, be used to provide a
44 multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
45 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year.

1 3.] 4. When determining the amount of money to [reserve for
2 transfer from the State General Fund to] include in the State
3 Education Fund in the proposed executive budget pursuant to
4 subsection 1, the Governor shall consider the recommendations of
5 the Commission, as revised by the Joint Interim Standing
6 Committee on Education, if applicable, for an optimal level of
7 funding for education and may [reserve] include an additional
8 amount of money [for transfer] to the State Education Fund that the
9 Governor determines to be sufficient to fund any recommendation
10 or any portion of a recommendation that the Governor includes in
11 the proposed executive budget.
12 [4.] 5. As part of the proposed executive budget, the Governor
13 may recommend to the Legislature a revision to any appropriation
14 made by law pursuant to NRS 387.1214, including, without
15 limitation, the statewide base per pupil funding amount, the adjusted
16 base per pupil funding for any school district, the multiplier for
17 weighted funding for any category of pupils or the creation or
18 elimination of a category of pupils to receive additional weighted
19 funding. The Governor may recommend additional funding for any
20 recommendation made pursuant to this subsection.
21 [5.] 6. If the Governor determines that it would be
22 impracticable to prepare the proposed executive budget as described
23 in subsection 1 or 2, the Governor may instead include in the
24 proposed executive budget a recommendation for such funding for
25 the public schools in this State as he or she determines to be
26 appropriate. [If the Governor includes in the proposed executive
27 budget recommendations pursuant to this subsection, the
28 recommendations must be accompanied by such recommendations
29 for legislation as the Governor determines to be appropriate to
30 improve the method by which funding for the public schools in this
31 State is determined.
32 6.] 7. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” means the
33 average percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price
34 Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as
35 published by the United States Department of Labor for the
36 immediately preceding 3 calendar years or, if that index ceases to be
37 published by the United States Department of Labor, the published
38 index that most closely resembles that index, as determined by the
39 Governor.
