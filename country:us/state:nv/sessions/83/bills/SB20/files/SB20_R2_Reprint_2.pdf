AN ACT relating to judicial administration; revising requirements
relating to certain proceedings in justice court; revising
provisions governing the selection of jurors; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain proceedings in a justice court to be recorded by
2 the use of sound recording equipment. (NRS 4.390) Existing law also specifies that
3 if a case is tried by jury in a justice court, a certified court reporter must be present
4 and report on the trial under certain circumstances. (NRS 175.011) Section 4 of this
5 bill eliminates this requirement, thereby authorizing a justice court to record a
6 proceeding before a jury using sound recording equipment under certain
7 circumstances.
8 Existing law provides that sound recordings of certain proceedings in justice
9 court must be preserved for certain periods. (NRS 4.420) Section 5.5 of this bill
10 provides that with respect to certain criminal proceedings in a justice court, sound
11 recordings must be preserved for a period of at least 5 years.
12 Existing law authorizes a district court to assign a jury commissioner to select
13 trial jurors. Existing law requires a jury commissioner so assigned to select trial
14 jurors from among the qualified electors of the county or city, as applicable, who
15 are not exempt from jury duty. As part of the jury selection process, existing law
16 requires a jury commissioner to compile and maintain a list of qualified electors
17 from information provided to the jury commissioner, including information
18 provided by the Department of Health and Human Services concerning persons
19 who receive public assistance. (NRS 6.045) Section 5.7 of this bill creates an
20 exception to this requirement if the inclusion of such information is prohibited by
21 federal law or regulation.
22 Existing law also requires the Department, upon the request of a district judge
23 or jury commissioner, to provide a list of the names and addresses of persons who

24 receive public assistance for use in jury selection. (NRS 422A.343) Section 5.9 of
25 this bill creates an exception to this requirement if the provision of such
26 information is prohibited by federal law or regulation.
