Senate Bill No. 20–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to judicial administration; revising requirements
relating to certain proceedings in justice court; revising
provisions governing the selection of jurors; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain proceedings in a justice court to be recorded by
the use of sound recording equipment. (NRS 4.390) Existing law also specifies that
if a case is tried by jury in a justice court, a certified court reporter must be present
and report on the trial under certain circumstances. (NRS 175.011) Section 4 of this
bill eliminates this requirement, thereby authorizing a justice court to record a
proceeding before a jury using sound recording equipment under certain
circumstances.
Existing law provides that sound recordings of certain proceedings in justice
court must be preserved for certain periods. (NRS 4.420) Section 5.5 of this bill
provides that with respect to certain criminal proceedings in a justice court, sound
recordings must be preserved for a period of at least 5 years.
Existing law authorizes a district court to assign a jury commissioner to select
trial jurors. Existing law requires a jury commissioner so assigned to select trial
jurors from among the qualified electors of the county or city, as applicable, who
are not exempt from jury duty. As part of the jury selection process, existing law
requires a jury commissioner to compile and maintain a list of qualified electors
from information provided to the jury commissioner, including information
provided by the Department of Health and Human Services concerning persons
who receive public assistance. (NRS 6.045) Section 5.7 of this bill creates an
exception to this requirement if the inclusion of such information is prohibited by
federal law or regulation.
Existing law also requires the Department, upon the request of a district judge
or jury commissioner, to provide a list of the names and addresses of persons who
receive public assistance for use in jury selection. (NRS 422A.343) Section 5.9 of
this bill creates an exception to this requirement if the provision of such
information is prohibited by federal law or regulation.
