SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to [criminal procedure.] judicial
administration. (BDR 14-476)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [criminal procedure;] judicial administration; revising
requirements relating to certain proceedings in justice court; revising
provisions governing the selection of jurors; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain proceedings in a justice court to be recorded by the use of
2 sound recording equipment. (NRS 4.390) Existing law also specifies that if a case is tried by
3 jury in a justice court, a certified court reporter must be present and report on the trial under
4 certain circumstances. (NRS 175.011) Section 4 of this bill eliminates this requirement,
5 thereby authorizing a justice court to record a proceeding before a jury using sound recording
6 equipment under certain circumstances.
7 Existing law provides that sound recordings of certain proceedings in justice court must
8 be preserved for certain periods. (NRS 4.420) Section 5.5 of this bill provides that with
9 respect to certain criminal proceedings in a justice court, sound recordings must be preserved
10 for a period of at least 5 years.
11 Existing law authorizes a district court to assign a jury commissioner to select trial
12 jurors. Existing law requires a jury commissioner so assigned to select trial jurors from
13 among the qualified electors of the county or city, as applicable, who are not exempt
14 from jury duty. As part of the jury selection process, existing law requires a jury
15 commissioner to compile and maintain a list of qualified electors from information
16 provided to the jury commissioner, including information provided by the Department
17 of Health and Human Services concerning persons who receive public assistance. (NRS
18 6.045) Section 5.7 of this bill creates an exception to this requirement if the inclusion of
19 such information is prohibited by federal law or regulation.
20 Existing law also requires the Department, upon the request of a district judge or
21 jury commissioner, to provide a list of the names and addresses of persons who receive
22 public assistance for use in jury selection. (NRS 422A.343) Section 5.9 of this bill creates
23 an exception to this requirement if the provision of such information is prohibited by
24 federal law or regulation.
