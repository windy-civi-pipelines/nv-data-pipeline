FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; [revising provisions governing the waiver
of the right of a defendant to have a preliminary examination;] revising
requirements relating to certain proceedings in justice court; [requiring
the joinder of certain misdemeanors with certain felonies or gross
misdemeanors;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law: (1) grants a defendant who is charged with an offense that is not triable in
2 the Justice Court the right to have a preliminary examination; and (2) authorizes the defendant
3 to waive the preliminary examination. (NRS 171.196) Section 1 of this bill provides that if a
4 defendant waives preliminary examination, the matter must not be returned to the justice court
5 if: (1) the magistrate advises the defendant in open court on the record that the waiver is
6 unconditional; or (2) the defendant affirms in writing that the waiver is unconditional.
7 Existing law authorizes a magistrate, when presiding over a preliminary hearing in justice
8 court, in any case other than a case in which the death penalty is sought, to choose whether to
9 employ a certified court reporter or appoint a person to use sound recording equipment to
10 record certain testimony and the proceedings of the court. (NRS 171.198) Section 2 of this bill
11 eliminates language prohibiting a magistrate from appointing a person to use sound recording
12 equipment in a case in which the death penalty is sought. Section 2 thereby authorizes a
13 magistrate, when presiding over any preliminary hearing in justice court, to choose whether to
14 employ a certified court reporter or appoint a person to use sound recording equipment to
15 record certain testimony and proceedings of the court.]
16 Existing law requires certain proceedings in a justice court to be recorded by the use of
17 sound recording equipment. (NRS 4.390) Existing law also specifies that if a case is tried by
18 jury in a justice court, a certified court reporter must be present and report on the trial under
19 certain circumstances. (NRS 175.011) Section 4 of this bill eliminates this requirement,
20 thereby authorizing a justice court to record a proceeding before a jury using sound recording
21 equipment under certain circumstances.
22 [Existing law provides that certain misdemeanors must be joined with related felonies or
23 gross misdemeanors in the district courts. (NRS 173.115) Section 3 of this bill expands this
24 requirement by providing that a misdemeanor must be joined with a related felony or gross
25 misdemeanor in the district courts unless: (1) the misdemeanor is based solely upon an alleged
26 violation of municipal code; or (2) an indictment is brought or information is filed in the
27 district court for a felony or gross misdemeanor or both after the convening of a grand jury.

Senate Amendment No. 333 to Senate Bill No. 20 Page 4
28 Section 3 also: (1) requires a magistrate to hold a defendant to answer in district court for a
29 misdemeanor charge contained in the same criminal complaint as a related felony or gross
30 misdemeanor under certain circumstances; and (2) makes various other changes relating to
31 misdemeanors which must be joined with a related felony or gross misdemeanor in district
32 court. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the exception to the
33 jurisdiction of municipal courts created by section 3.]
34 Existing law provides that sound recordings of certain proceedings in justice court
35 must be preserved for certain periods. (NRS 4.420) Section 5.5 of this bill provides that
36 with respect to certain criminal proceedings in a justice court, sound recordings must be
37 preserved for a period of at least 5 years.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. [NRS 171.196 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 171.196 1. If an offense is not triable in the Justice Court, the defendant
3 must not be called upon to plead. If the defendant waives preliminary examination,
4 the magistrate shall immediately hold the defendant to answer in the district court.
5 If the defendant is advised by the magistrate in open court on the record that the
6 waiver is unconditional or the defendant affirms in a written waiver that the
7 waiver is unconditional, the matter must not be returned to the Justice Court and
8 all further proceedings are in the exclusive jurisdiction of the district court.
9 2. If the defendant does not waive examination, the magistrate shall hear the
10 evidence within 15 days, unless for good cause shown the magistrate extends such
11 time. Unless the defendant waives counsel, reasonable time must be allowed for
12 counsel to appear.
13 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the magistrate postpones
14 the examination at the request of a party, the magistrate may order that party to pay
15 all or part of the costs and fees expended to have a witness attend the examination.
16 The magistrate shall not require a party who requested the postponement of the
17 examination to pay for the costs and fees of a witness if:
18 (a) It was not reasonably necessary for the witness to attend the examination;
19 or
20 (b) The magistrate ordered the extension pursuant to subsection 4.
21 4. If application is made for the appointment of counsel for an indigent
22 defendant, the magistrate shall postpone the examination until:
23 (a) The application has been granted or denied; and
24 (b) If the application is granted, the attorney appointed or the public defender
25 has had reasonable time to appear.
26 5. The defendant may cross-examine witnesses against him or her and may
27 introduce evidence in his or her own behalf.
28 6. Hearsay evidence consisting of a statement made by the alleged victim of
29 the offense is admissible at a preliminary examination conducted pursuant to this
30 section only if the defendant is charged with one or more of the following offenses:
31 (a) A sexual offense committed against a child who is under the age of 16
32 years if the offense is punishable as a felony. As used in this paragraph, “sexual
33 offense” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 179D.097.
34 (b) Abuse of a child pursuant to NRS 200.508 if the offense is committed
35 against a child who is under the age of 16 years and the offense is punishable as a
36 felony.

Senate Amendment No. 333 to Senate Bill No. 20 Page 5
1 (c) An act which constitutes domestic violence pursuant to NRS 33.018, which
2 is punishable as a felony and which resulted in substantial bodily harm to the
3 alleged victim.] (Deleted by amendment.)
4 Sec. 2. [NRS 171.198 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 171.198 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a magistrate shall
6 employ a certified court reporter to take down all the testimony and the proceedings
7 on the hearing or examination and, within such time as the court may designate,
8 have such testimony and proceedings transcribed into typewritten transcript.
9 2. A magistrate who presides over a preliminary hearing in a justice court [, in
10 any case other than in a case in which the death penalty is sought,] may employ a
11 certified court reporter to take down all the testimony and the proceedings on the
12 hearing or appoint a person to use sound recording equipment to record all the
13 testimony and the proceedings on the hearing. If the magistrate appoints a person to
14 use sound recording equipment to record the testimony and proceedings on the
15 hearing, the testimony and proceedings must be recorded and transcribed in the
16 same manner as set forth in NRS 4.390 to 4.420, inclusive. Any transcript of the
17 testimony and proceedings produced from a recording conducted pursuant to this
18 subsection is subject to the provisions of this section in the same manner as a
19 transcript produced by a certified court reporter.
20 3. When the testimony of each witness is all taken and transcribed by the
21 reporter, the reporter shall certify to the transcript in the same manner as for a
22 transcript of testimony in the district court, which certificate authenticates the
23 transcript for all purposes of this title.
24 4. Before the date set for trial, either party may move the court before which
25 the case is pending to add to, delete from or otherwise correct the transcript to
26 conform with the testimony as given and to settle the transcript so altered.
27 5. The compensation for the services of a reporter employed as provided in
28 this section are the same as provided in NRS 3.370, to be paid out of the county
29 treasury as other claims against the county are allowed and paid.
30 6. Testimony reduced to writing and authenticated according to the provisions
31 of this section must be filed by the examining magistrate with the clerk of the
32 district court of the magistrate’s county, and if the prisoner is subsequently
33 examined upon a writ of habeas corpus, such testimony must be considered as
34 given before such judge or court. A copy of the transcript must be furnished to the
35 defendant and to the district attorney.
36 7. The testimony so taken may be used:
37 (a) By the defendant; or
38 (b) By the State if the defendant was represented by counsel or affirmatively
39 waived his or her right to counsel,
40  upon the trial of the cause, and in all proceedings therein, when the witness is
41 sick, out of the State, dead, or persistent in refusing to testify despite an order of the
42 judge to do so, or when the witness’s personal attendance cannot be had in court.]
43 (Deleted by amendment.)
44 Sec. 3. [NRS 173.115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 173.115 1. Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment or
46 information in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged, whether
47 felonies or gross misdemeanors or both, are:
48 (a) Based on the same act or transaction; or
49 (b) Based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or
50 constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.
51 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [3:] 4:
52 (a) A misdemeanor which was committed within the boundaries of a city and
53 which would otherwise be within the jurisdiction of the municipal court must be

Senate Amendment No. 333 to Senate Bill No. 20 Page 6
1 charged in the same criminal complaint as a felony or gross misdemeanor or both if
2 the misdemeanor is based on the same act or transaction as the felony or gross
3 misdemeanor. A charge of a misdemeanor which meets the requirements of this
4 subsection and which is erroneously included in a criminal complaint that is filed in
5 the municipal court shall be deemed to be void ab initio and must be stricken.
6 (b) A battery which constitutes domestic violence that is punishable as a
7 misdemeanor pursuant to NRS 200.485 must be charged in the same indictment or
8 information in district court as a felony or gross misdemeanor or both if the battery
9 is based on the same act or transaction as the felony or gross misdemeanor.
10 3. A misdemeanor:
11 (a) Must be charged in the same indictment or information as a felony or
12 gross misdemeanor or both, if the misdemeanor:
13 (1) Meets the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 2; or
14 (2) Was based on the same:
15 (I) Act or transaction as the felony or gross misdemeanor or both; or
16 (II) Two or more acts or transactions connected together or
17 constituting part of a common scheme or plan as the felony or gross
18 misdemeanor or both.
19 (b) That meets the requirements of paragraph (a) and which is erroneously
20 included in a criminal complaint that is filed in the municipal court shall be
21 deemed to be void ab initio and must be stricken.
22 4. The provisions of [subsection] subsections 2 and 3 do not apply:
23 (a) To a misdemeanor based solely upon an alleged violation of a municipal
24 ordinance.
25 (b) If an indictment is brought or an information is filed in the district court for
26 a felony or gross misdemeanor or both after the convening of a grand jury.
27 5. A magistrate shall hold a defendant to answer in district court for a
28 misdemeanor that is charged pursuant to this section in the same criminal
29 complaint as a felony or gross misdemeanor or both, if:
30 (a) The defendant waives preliminary examination; or
31 (b) The magistrate, following a preliminary examination:
32 (1) Holds the defendant to answer in district court pursuant to NRS
33 171.206 for a felony or a gross misdemeanor charge contained in the criminal
34 complaint; and
35 (2) Finds there is probable cause to believe that the misdemeanor has
36 been committed and that the defendant has committed it.
37 6. The district court shall dispose of a misdemeanor charged pursuant to
38 this section in the same indictment or information as a felony or gross
39 misdemeanor or both. ] (Deleted by amendment.)
40 Sec. 4. NRS 175.011 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 175.011 1. Cases required to be tried by jury must be so tried unless the
42 defendant waives a jury trial in writing with the approval of the court and the
43 consent of the prosecuting attorney. A defendant who pleads not guilty to the
44 charge of a capital offense must be tried by jury.
45 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1, in a justice court, a case must
46 be tried by jury only if the defendant so demands in writing not less than 30 days
47 before trial. [Except as otherwise provided in NRS 4.390 and 4.400, if a case is
48 tried by jury, a reporter must be present who is a certified court reporter and shall
49 report the trial.]
50 3. Any proceeding before a jury in justice court may be recorded using
51 sound recording equipment in accordance with NRS 4.390 and 4.400.
52 Sec. 5. [NRS 5.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:

5 2. Except as otherwise provided in [subsection] subsections 2 and 3 of NRS
6 173.115, the municipal courts have jurisdiction of all misdemeanors committed in
7 violation of the ordinances of their respective cities. A municipal court may, upon
8 approval of the district court, transfer original jurisdiction of a misdemeanor to the
9 district court for the purpose of assigning an offender to a program established:
10 (a) By the district court pursuant to:
11 (1) NRS 176A.250, if the municipal court:
12 (I) Has not established its own program pursuant to that section; or
13 (II) Determines that the transfer is appropriate and necessary; or
14 (2) NRS 176A.280, if the municipal court has not established its own

17 outpatient treatment pursuant to that section.
18 3. The municipal courts have jurisdiction of:

23 (c) Actions for the breach of any bond given by any officer or person to or for
24 the use or benefit of the city, and of any action for damages to which the city is a
25 party, and upon all forfeited recognizances given to or for the use or benefit of the
26 city, and upon all bonds given on appeals from the municipal court in any of the
27 cases named in this section, when the principal sum claimed does not exceed
28 $2,500.

33 if allowed, does not exceed $2,500.
34 (f) Actions seeking an order pursuant to NRS 441A.195.
35 4. Nothing contained in subsection 3 gives the municipal court jurisdiction to
36 determine any such cause when it appears from the pleadings that the validity of
37 any tax, assessment or levy, or title to real property, is necessarily an issue in the
