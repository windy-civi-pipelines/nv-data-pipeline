EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to energy; requiring certain wholesale facilities for the generation
of electricity [from solar energy] to purchase power from certain small
electric utilities; requiring a provider of electric service that serves
a wholesale generation facility in the service territory of certain
small electric utilities to make certain payments to the utility; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity
2 to certain cooperative associations, nonprofit corporations and nonprofit associations that

4 local governmental entities to provide electric service. (Chapters 709 and 710 of NRS) This
5 bill requires certain wholesale facilities for the generation of electricity [from solar energy]
6 which are located within the service territory of such a cooperative association, nonprofit
7 corporation or nonprofit association or municipal utility to purchase the energy required to
8 operate, maintain or repair the facility from the cooperative association, nonprofit corporation
9 or nonprofit association or municipal utility. This bill further requires the facility to: (1)
10 adhere to all rules, rates and policies established by the governing board of the cooperative
11 association, nonprofit corporation or nonprofit association or municipal utility [;] relating to
12 the delivery of and payment for power; and (2) [grant access by the] authorize a
13 cooperative association, nonprofit corporation or nonprofit association or municipal utility to
14 [the facility as necessary] install or certify the proper operation of a meter to accurately
15 measure and provide accurate monthly readings of the [service loads] energy use of the
16 facility. This bill further: (1) authorizes a cooperative association, nonprofit corporation,
17 nonprofit association or municipal utility to charge certain rates to the wholesale
18 generation facility; and (2) requires a provider of electric service that provides power to
19 a wholesale generation facility in the service territory of the cooperative association,

16 generation facility and provides the rural electric utility with accurate monthly
17 readings of that use.
18 2. A rural electric utility may charge to a wholesale generation facility a
19 retail rate for station power which is commensurate with the rate the rural
20 electric utility charges to customers in its service territory with comparable load
21 magnitudes, load factors and other relevant characteristics.
22 3. If a wholesale generation facility receives station power from a provider
23 of electric service other than the rural electric utility for the service territory in
24 which the wholesale generation facility is located, the provider of electric service
25 shall remit to the rural electric utility an amount equal to the payment which the
26 wholesale generation facility would have paid for such station power if provided
27 by the rural electric utility.
28 4. As used in this section:
