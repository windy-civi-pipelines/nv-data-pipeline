Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of Medical
2 Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete certain continuing
3 education as a condition to the renewal of the license. [Existing law sets forth certain courses
4 of instruction and training that each Board must require certain licensees to complete,
5 including, among other courses and training, a course of instruction on evidence-based suicide
6 prevention and awareness and training in the screening, brief intervention and referral to
7 treatment approach to substance use disorder.] (NRS 630.253, 633.471) [Additionally,
8 existing law requires each Board to require a physician, osteopathic physician and physician
9 assistant who is registered to dispense controlled substances to complete at least 2 hours of
10 training relating specifically to persons with substance use and other addictive disorders and
11 the prescribing of opioids during each period of licensure. (NRS 630.2535, 633.473) Sections]
12 Section 1 [, 12 and 21] of this bill [eliminate] eliminates provisions requiring [each] the

Assembly Amendment No. 108 to Assembly Bill No. 56 Page 4
13 Board of Medical Examiners to require the completion of [certain specified courses] a
14 course of instruction [and training. Sections 1 and 12 maintain the requirement for certain
15 licensees to complete continuing education but, rather than requiring each Board to require the
16 completion of certain specified courses and training, sections 1 and 12 require each Board to
17 encourage each licensee to complete courses of instruction in, among other subjects: (1)
18 evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness; (2) the screening, brief intervention and
19 referral to treatment approach to substance use disorder; (3) the prescribing of opioids; and (4)
20 care for persons with an addictive disorder. Sections 5 and 19 of this bill eliminate provisions
21 making the failure of a licensee to complete training relating to persons with substance use
22 and other addictive disorders and the prescribing of opioids grounds for initiating disciplinary
23 action by the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine,
24 respectively.] relating to the medical consequences of an act of terrorism that involves the
25 use of a weapon of mass destruction. Section 12 [additionally] of this bill increases, from
26 35 to 40, the number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
27 licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete during each
28 period of licensure.
29 Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations regarding the
30 licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law establishes a biennial
31 registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing
32 law, the Board is required to exempt a physician assistant on inactive status from paying the
33 biennial registration fee. (NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception.
34 Section 4 of this bill instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive
35 status to pay a fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum
36 amount of that fee.
37 Section 3 [additionally increases] revises provisions setting forth the maximum amount
38 of [the] various fees [for: (1) biennial registration for a physician from $800 to $1,200; and
39 (2) biennial registration for a physician who is on inactive status from $400 to $600.] charged
40 by the Board. Section 3 increases the maximum amount of certain fees, removes certain
41 fees and establishes the maximum amount of a fee the Board is required to charge for
42 certain services provided by the Board.
43 Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential, including,
44 among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other proof submitted in
45 support of or to verify the contents of an application for a license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of
46 this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a licensee, to provide to an employer of the
47 licensee or an entity credentialing the licensee copies of any documents or other information
48 obtained by the Board during the application process for the issuance of the license of the
49 licensee, including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
50 the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and verifying
51 certain other matters concerning the licensee.
52 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the issuance by the State Board of
53 Osteopathic Medicine of a license to practice osteopathic medicine, including, among
54 other requirements, the requirement that an applicant must: (1) have graduated from a
55 school of osteopathic medicine before 1995 and completed a hospital internship or
56 certain postgraduate training; (2) have completed 3 years, or such other length of time
57 as required by certain programs of postgraduate medical education as a resident in the
58 United States or Canada; or (3) be a resident who is enrolled in a postgraduate training
59 program in this State, have completed 24 months of the program and have committed, in
60 writing, that he or she will complete the program. (NRS 633.311) Section 6.7 of this bill
61 revises the requirements for a person who is a resident enrolled in a postgraduate
62 training program to obtain a license to allow a license to be issued to a resident who is
63 enrolled in a postgraduate training program in the United States or Canada that is
64 approved by the Board or certain other organizations who has completed 24 months of
65 the program and who has committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the
66 program. Section 6.7 also provides that if, after issuing a license to practice osteopathic
67 medicine, the Board obtains information that differs from the information provided by
68 the applicant or otherwise received by the Board, the Board may take certain action
69 against the applicant.
70 Section 6.3 of this bill provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or
71 attempting to obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice osteopathic medicine by

Assembly Amendment No. 108 to Assembly Bill No. 56 Page 5
72 bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
73 incomplete statement constitutes grounds for the Board to initiate disciplinary action
74 against a licensee and to deny licensure to an applicant.
75 Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a license to
76 practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine and sets
77 forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each calendar year. (NRS 633.471)
78 Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions, for the biennial renewal of such a license
79 and establishes the renewal date for such a license as December 31 of each even-numbered
80 year.
81 Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician assistant
82 issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead provide for the
83 biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as December 31 of each odd-
84 numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial renewal of a license as an
85 anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS 633.4254) Section 7 of this bill
86 establishes a renewal date for such a license as December 31 of each odd-numbered year.
87 Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain licenses
88 issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
89 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously licensed as a
90 physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of Medical Examiners and the
91 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677, 630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845,
92 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258, 633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under
93 existing law, a person who is licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by
94 the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by
95 both the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is required
96 to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as a physician
97 assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all applicable fees, including the
98 fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for an application for and the issuance of a
99 simultaneous license as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and
100 the annual simultaneous registration fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous
101 registration fee for an anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of
102 Osteopathic Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure while
103 renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in the application
104 that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426, 633.438, 633.4718)
105 Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person to pay to the State Board of
106 Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license renewal fee, rather than an annual or
107 biennial simultaneous license registration fee. Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a
108 reference to the biennial registration of a license.
109 Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain a list of
110 each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain training that each such
111 licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least annually with information received from
112 licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13
113 of this bill requires the Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such
114 information from licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium.
115 Sections 16 and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
116 licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain
117 osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
118 Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by the Board.
119 (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of certain fees; (2) increases
120 the amount of certain fees to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of
121 licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants; and (3) establishes a
122 biennial license renewal fee and a biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an
123 anesthesiologist assistant.
