Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of
Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete
certain continuing education as a condition to the renewal of the license. (NRS

Section 2:
630.253, 633.471) Section 1 of this bill eliminates provisions requiring the Board
of Medical Examiners to require the completion of a course of instruction relating
to the medical consequences of an act of terrorism that involves the use of a
weapon of mass destruction. Section 12 of this bill increases, from 35 to 40, the
number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete
during each period of licensure.
Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations
regarding the licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law
establishes a biennial registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the
Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing law, the Board is required to exempt a
physician assistant on inactive status from paying the biennial registration fee.
(NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception. Section 4 of this bill
instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum amount
of that fee.

Section 3:
Section 3 revises provisions setting forth the maximum amount of various fees
charged by the Board. Section 3 increases the maximum amount of certain fees,
removes certain fees and establishes the maximum amount of a fee the Board is
required to charge for certain services provided by the Board.
Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential,
including, among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other
proof submitted in support of or to verify the contents of an application for a
-

license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a
licensee, to provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
licensee copies of any documents or other information obtained by the Board
during the application process for the issuance of the license of the licensee,
including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and
verifying certain other matters concerning the licensee.
Existing law sets forth the requirements for the issuance by the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine of a license to practice osteopathic medicine, including,
among other requirements, the requirement that an applicant must: (1) have
graduated from a school of osteopathic medicine before 1995 and completed a
hospital internship or certain postgraduate training; (2) have completed 3 years, or
such other length of time as required by certain programs of postgraduate medical
education as a resident in the United States or Canada; or (3) be a resident who is
enrolled in a postgraduate training program in this State, have completed 24 months
of the program and have committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the
program. (NRS 633.311) Section 6.7 of this bill revises the requirements for a
person who is a resident enrolled in a postgraduate training program to obtain a
license to allow a license to be issued to a resident who is enrolled in a postgraduate
training program in the United States or Canada that is approved by the Board or
certain other organizations who has completed 24 months of the program and who
has committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the program. Section 6.7
also provides that if, after issuing a license to practice osteopathic medicine, the
Board obtains information that differs from the information provided by the
applicant or otherwise received by the Board, the Board may take certain action
against the applicant.

Section 4:
Section 6.3 of this bill provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or
attempting to obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice osteopathic medicine
by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete statement constitutes grounds for the Board to initiate disciplinary
action against a licensee and to deny licensure to an applicant.
Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a
license to practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
Medicine and sets forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each
calendar year. (NRS 633.471) Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions,
for the biennial renewal of such a license and establishes the renewal date for such
a license as December 31 of each even-numbered year.
Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician
assistant issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead
provide for the biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as
December 31 of each odd-numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial
renewal of a license as an anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS

Section 5:
633.4254) Section 7 of this bill establishes a renewal date for such a license as
December 31 of each odd-numbered year.

Section 6:
Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain
licenses issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously
licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of
Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677,

Section 7:
630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845, 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258,

Section 8:
633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under existing law, a person who is
licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by both the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is
required to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as
a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all
applicable fees, including the fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for an
application for and the issuance of a simultaneous license as a physician assistant or
anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and the annual simultaneous registration
fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous registration fee for an
anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of Osteopathic
Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure while
renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in the
application that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426,

Section 9:
633.438, 633.4718) Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person
to pay to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license
renewal fee, rather than an annual or biennial simultaneous license registration fee.

Section 10:
Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a reference to the biennial registration of
a license.
Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain
a list of each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain
training that each such licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least
annually with information received from licensees who renewed their licenses
during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13 of this bill requires the
Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such information from
licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium. Sections 16
and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure
for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by
the Board. (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of
certain fees; (2) increases the amount of certain fees to account for the change from
an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and
physician assistants; and (3) establishes a biennial license renewal fee and a
biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an anesthesiologist assistant.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 56–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to providers of health care; revising requirements
for continuing education and training for certain providers of
health care; requiring the Board of Medical Examiners to
require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
biennial registration fee; revising the provisions relating to
fees charged and collected by the Board; requiring the Board,
if authorized by a licensee, to provide to an employer of the
licensee or an entity credentialing the licensee certain
documents and information; setting forth certain grounds for
the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to initiate
disciplinary action against a licensee or deny licensure to an
applicant; revising requirements for the issuance by the
Board of a license to practice osteopathic medicine;
providing for the biennial renewal of certain licenses issued
by the Board; establishing and revising certain fees charged
by the Board; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of
Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete
certain continuing education as a condition to the renewal of the license. (NRS
630.253, 633.471) Section 1 of this bill eliminates provisions requiring the Board
of Medical Examiners to require the completion of a course of instruction relating
to the medical consequences of an act of terrorism that involves the use of a
weapon of mass destruction. Section 12 of this bill increases, from 35 to 40, the
number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete
during each period of licensure.
Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations
regarding the licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law
establishes a biennial registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the
Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing law, the Board is required to exempt a
physician assistant on inactive status from paying the biennial registration fee.
(NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception. Section 4 of this bill
instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum amount
of that fee.
Section 3 revises provisions setting forth the maximum amount of various fees
charged by the Board. Section 3 increases the maximum amount of certain fees,
removes certain fees and establishes the maximum amount of a fee the Board is
required to charge for certain services provided by the Board.
Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential,
including, among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other
proof submitted in support of or to verify the contents of an application for a
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a
licensee, to provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
licensee copies of any documents or other information obtained by the Board
during the application process for the issuance of the license of the licensee,
including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and
verifying certain other matters concerning the licensee.
Existing law sets forth the requirements for the issuance by the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine of a license to practice osteopathic medicine, including,
among other requirements, the requirement that an applicant must: (1) have
graduated from a school of osteopathic medicine before 1995 and completed a
hospital internship or certain postgraduate training; (2) have completed 3 years, or
such other length of time as required by certain programs of postgraduate medical
education as a resident in the United States or Canada; or (3) be a resident who is
enrolled in a postgraduate training program in this State, have completed 24 months
of the program and have committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the
program. (NRS 633.311) Section 6.7 of this bill revises the requirements for a
person who is a resident enrolled in a postgraduate training program to obtain a
license to allow a license to be issued to a resident who is enrolled in a postgraduate
training program in the United States or Canada that is approved by the Board or
certain other organizations who has completed 24 months of the program and who
has committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the program. Section 6.7
also provides that if, after issuing a license to practice osteopathic medicine, the
Board obtains information that differs from the information provided by the
applicant or otherwise received by the Board, the Board may take certain action
against the applicant.
Section 6.3 of this bill provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or
attempting to obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice osteopathic medicine
by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete statement constitutes grounds for the Board to initiate disciplinary
action against a licensee and to deny licensure to an applicant.
Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a
license to practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
Medicine and sets forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each
calendar year. (NRS 633.471) Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions,
for the biennial renewal of such a license and establishes the renewal date for such
a license as December 31 of each even-numbered year.
Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician
assistant issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead
provide for the biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as
December 31 of each odd-numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial
renewal of a license as an anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS
633.4254) Section 7 of this bill establishes a renewal date for such a license as
December 31 of each odd-numbered year.
Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain
licenses issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously
licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of
Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677,
630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845, 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258,
633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under existing law, a person who is
licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by both the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is
required to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as
a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all
applicable fees, including the fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for an
application for and the issuance of a simultaneous license as a physician assistant or
anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and the annual simultaneous registration
fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous registration fee for an
anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of Osteopathic
Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure while
renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in the
application that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426,
633.438, 633.4718) Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person
to pay to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license
renewal fee, rather than an annual or biennial simultaneous license registration fee.
Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a reference to the biennial registration of
a license.
Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain
a list of each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain
training that each such licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least
annually with information received from licensees who renewed their licenses
during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13 of this bill requires the
Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such information from
licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium. Sections 16
and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure
for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by
the Board. (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of
certain fees; (2) increases the amount of certain fees to account for the change from
an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and
physician assistants; and (3) establishes a biennial license renewal fee and a
biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an anesthesiologist assistant.
