Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of
2 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete
3 certain continuing education as a condition to the renewal of the license. Existing
4 law sets forth certain courses of instruction and training that each Board must
5 require certain licensees to complete, including, among other courses and training,
6 a course of instruction on evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness and
7 training in the screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment approach to
8 substance use disorder. (NRS 630.253, 633.471) Additionally, existing law requires
9 each Board to require a physician, osteopathic physician and physician assistant

10 who is registered to dispense controlled substances to complete at least 2 hours of
11 training relating specifically to persons with substance use and other addictive
12 disorders and the prescribing of opioids during each period of licensure. (NRS
13 630.2535, 633.473) Sections 1, 12 and 21 of this bill eliminate provisions requiring
14 each Board to require the completion of certain specified courses of instruction and
15 training. Sections 1 and 12 maintain the requirement for certain licensees to
16 complete continuing education but, rather than requiring each Board to require the
17 completion of certain specified courses and training, sections 1 and 12 require each
18 Board to encourage each licensee to complete courses of instruction in, among
19 other subjects: (1) evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness; (2) the
20 screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment approach to substance use
21 disorder; (3) the prescribing of opioids; and (4) care for persons with an addictive
22 disorder. Sections 5 and 19 of this bill eliminate provisions making the failure of a
23 licensee to complete training relating to persons with substance use and other
24 addictive disorders and the prescribing of opioids grounds for initiating disciplinary
25 action by the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic
26 Medicine, respectively. Section 12 additionally increases, from 35 to 40, the
27 number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
28 licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete
29 during each period of licensure.
30 Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations
31 regarding the licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law
32 establishes a biennial registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the
33 Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing law, the Board is required to exempt a
34 physician assistant on inactive status from paying the biennial registration fee.
35 (NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception. Section 4 of this bill
36 instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
37 fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum amount
38 of that fee.
39 Section 3 additionally increases the maximum amount of the fees for: (1)
40 biennial registration for a physician from $800 to $1,200; and (2) biennial
41 registration for a physician who is on inactive status from $400 to $600.
42 Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential,
43 including, among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other
44 proof submitted in support of or to verify the contents of an application for a
45 license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a
46 licensee, to provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
47 licensee copies of any documents or other information obtained by the Board
48 during the application process for the issuance of the license of the licensee,
49 including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
50 the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and
51 verifying certain other matters concerning the licensee.
52 Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a
53 license to practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
54 Medicine and sets forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each
55 calendar year. (NRS 633.471) Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions,
56 for the biennial renewal of such a license and establishes the renewal date for such
57 a license as December 31 of each even-numbered year.
58 Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician
59 assistant issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead
60 provide for the biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as
61 December 31 of each odd-numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial
62 renewal of a license as an anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS
63 633.4254) Section 7 of this bill establishes a renewal date for such a license as
64 December 31 of each odd-numbered year.

– 3 –
65 Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain
66 licenses issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
67 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously
68 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of
69 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677,
70 630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845, 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258,
71 633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under existing law, a person who is
72 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the State Board of
73 Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by both the
74 Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is
75 required to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as
76 a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all
77 applicable fees, including, the fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for
78 an application for and the issuance of a simultaneous license as a physician
79 assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and the annual simultaneous
80 registration fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous registration fee for
81 an anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of
82 Osteopathic Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure
83 while renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in
84 the application that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426,
85 633.438, 633.4718) Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person
86 to pay to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license
87 renewal fee, rather than an annual or biennial simultaneous license registration fee.
88 Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a reference to the biennial registration of
89 a license.
90 Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain
91 a list of each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain
92 training that each such licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least
93 annually with information received from licensees who renewed their licenses
94 during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13 of this bill requires the
95 Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such information from
96 licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium. Sections 16
97 and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
98 licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure
99 for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
100 Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by
101 the Board. (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of
102 certain fees; (2) increases the amount of certain fees to account for the change from
103 an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and
104 physician assistants; and (3) establishes a biennial license renewal fee and a
105 biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an anesthesiologist assistant.

(ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the licensing of certain
providers of health care. (BDR 54-255)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to providers of health care; revising requirements
for continuing education and training for certain providers
of health care; requiring the Board of Medical Examiners
to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
biennial registration fee; increasing the maximum amount
of certain fees charged and collected by the Board;
requiring the Board, if authorized by a licensee, to
provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity
credentialing the licensee certain documents and
information; providing for the biennial renewal of certain
licenses issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
Medicine; establishing and revising certain fees charged
by the Board; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of
2 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete
3 certain continuing education as a condition to the renewal of the license. Existing
4 law sets forth certain courses of instruction and training that each Board must
5 require certain licensees to complete, including, among other courses and training,
6 a course of instruction on evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness and
7 training in the screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment approach to
8 substance use disorder. (NRS 630.253, 633.471) Additionally, existing law requires
9 each Board to require a physician, osteopathic physician and physician assistant
-

– 2 –
10 who is registered to dispense controlled substances to complete at least 2 hours of
11 training relating specifically to persons with substance use and other addictive
12 disorders and the prescribing of opioids during each period of licensure. (NRS
13 630.2535, 633.473) Sections 1, 12 and 21 of this bill eliminate provisions requiring
14 each Board to require the completion of certain specified courses of instruction and
15 training. Sections 1 and 12 maintain the requirement for certain licensees to
16 complete continuing education but, rather than requiring each Board to require the
17 completion of certain specified courses and training, sections 1 and 12 require each
18 Board to encourage each licensee to complete courses of instruction in, among
19 other subjects: (1) evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness; (2) the
20 screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment approach to substance use
21 disorder; (3) the prescribing of opioids; and (4) care for persons with an addictive
22 disorder. Sections 5 and 19 of this bill eliminate provisions making the failure of a
23 licensee to complete training relating to persons with substance use and other
24 addictive disorders and the prescribing of opioids grounds for initiating disciplinary
25 action by the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic
26 Medicine, respectively. Section 12 additionally increases, from 35 to 40, the
27 number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
28 licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete
29 during each period of licensure.
30 Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations
31 regarding the licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law
32 establishes a biennial registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the
33 Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing law, the Board is required to exempt a
34 physician assistant on inactive status from paying the biennial registration fee.
35 (NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception. Section 4 of this bill
36 instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
37 fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum amount
38 of that fee.
39 Section 3 additionally increases the maximum amount of the fees for: (1)
40 biennial registration for a physician from $800 to $1,200; and (2) biennial
41 registration for a physician who is on inactive status from $400 to $600.
42 Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential,
43 including, among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other
44 proof submitted in support of or to verify the contents of an application for a
45 license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a
46 licensee, to provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
47 licensee copies of any documents or other information obtained by the Board
48 during the application process for the issuance of the license of the licensee,
49 including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
50 the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and
51 verifying certain other matters concerning the licensee.
52 Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a
53 license to practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
54 Medicine and sets forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each
55 calendar year. (NRS 633.471) Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions,
56 for the biennial renewal of such a license and establishes the renewal date for such
57 a license as December 31 of each even-numbered year.
58 Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician
59 assistant issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead
60 provide for the biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as
61 December 31 of each odd-numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial
62 renewal of a license as an anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS
63 633.4254) Section 7 of this bill establishes a renewal date for such a license as
64 December 31 of each odd-numbered year.
-
*AB56*

– 3 –
65 Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain
66 licenses issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
67 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously
68 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of
69 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677,
70 630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845, 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258,
71 633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under existing law, a person who is
72 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the State Board of
73 Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by both the
74 Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is
75 required to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as
76 a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all
77 applicable fees, including, the fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for
78 an application for and the issuance of a simultaneous license as a physician
79 assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and the annual simultaneous
80 registration fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous registration fee for
81 an anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of
82 Osteopathic Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure
83 while renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in
84 the application that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426,
85 633.438, 633.4718) Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person
86 to pay to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license
87 renewal fee, rather than an annual or biennial simultaneous license registration fee.
88 Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a reference to the biennial registration of
89 a license.
90 Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain
91 a list of each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain
92 training that each such licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least
93 annually with information received from licensees who renewed their licenses
94 during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13 of this bill requires the
95 Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such information from
96 licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium. Sections 16
97 and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
98 licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure
99 for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
100 Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by
101 the Board. (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of
102 certain fees; (2) increases the amount of certain fees to account for the change from
103 an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and
104 physician assistants; and (3) establishes a biennial license renewal fee and a
105 biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an anesthesiologist assistant.
