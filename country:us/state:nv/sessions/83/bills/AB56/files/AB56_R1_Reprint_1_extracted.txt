Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of
2 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete
3 certain continuing education as a condition to the renewal of the license. (NRS
4 630.253, 633.471) Section 1 of this bill eliminates provisions requiring the Board
5 of Medical Examiners to require the completion of a course of instruction relating
-
*AB56_R1*
– 2 –
6 to the medical consequences of an act of terrorism that involves the use of a
7 weapon of mass destruction. Section 12 of this bill increases, from 35 to 40, the
8 number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
9 licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete
10 during each period of licensure.
11 Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations
12 regarding the licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law
13 establishes a biennial registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the
14 Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing law, the Board is required to exempt a
15 physician assistant on inactive status from paying the biennial registration fee.
16 (NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception. Section 4 of this bill
17 instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
18 fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum amount
19 of that fee.
20 Section 3 revises provisions setting forth the maximum amount of various fees
21 charged by the Board. Section 3 increases the maximum amount of certain fees,
22 removes certain fees and establishes the maximum amount of a fee the Board is
23 required to charge for certain services provided by the Board.
24 Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential,
25 including, among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other
26 proof submitted in support of or to verify the contents of an application for a
27 license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a
28 licensee, to provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
29 licensee copies of any documents or other information obtained by the Board
30 during the application process for the issuance of the license of the licensee,
31 including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
32 the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and
33 verifying certain other matters concerning the licensee.
34 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the issuance by the State Board of
35 Osteopathic Medicine of a license to practice osteopathic medicine, including,
36 among other requirements, the requirement that an applicant must: (1) have
37 graduated from a school of osteopathic medicine before 1995 and completed a
38 hospital internship or certain postgraduate training; (2) have completed 3 years, or
39 such other length of time as required by certain programs of postgraduate medical
40 education as a resident in the United States or Canada; or (3) be a resident who is
41 enrolled in a postgraduate training program in this State, have completed 24 months
42 of the program and have committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the
43 program. (NRS 633.311) Section 6.7 of this bill revises the requirements for a
44 person who is a resident enrolled in a postgraduate training program to obtain a
45 license to allow a license to be issued to a resident who is enrolled in a postgraduate
46 training program in the United States or Canada that is approved by the Board or
47 certain other organizations who has completed 24 months of the program and who
48 has committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the program. Section 6.7
49 also provides that if, after issuing a license to practice osteopathic medicine, the
50 Board obtains information that differs from the information provided by the
51 applicant or otherwise received by the Board, the Board may take certain action
52 against the applicant.
53 Section 6.3 of this bill provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or
54 attempting to obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice osteopathic medicine
55 by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
56 incomplete statement constitutes grounds for the Board to initiate disciplinary
57 action against a licensee and to deny licensure to an applicant.
58 Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a
59 license to practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
60 Medicine and sets forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each
-
*AB56_R1*
– 3 –
61 calendar year. (NRS 633.471) Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions,
62 for the biennial renewal of such a license and establishes the renewal date for such
63 a license as December 31 of each even-numbered year.
64 Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician
65 assistant issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead
66 provide for the biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as
67 December 31 of each odd-numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial
68 renewal of a license as an anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS
69 633.4254) Section 7 of this bill establishes a renewal date for such a license as
70 December 31 of each odd-numbered year.
71 Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain
72 licenses issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
73 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously
74 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of
75 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677,
76 630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845, 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258,
77 633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under existing law, a person who is
78 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the State Board of
79 Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by both the
80 Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is
81 required to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as
82 a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all
83 applicable fees, including the fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for an
84 application for and the issuance of a simultaneous license as a physician assistant or
85 anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and the annual simultaneous registration
86 fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous registration fee for an
87 anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of Osteopathic
88 Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure while
89 renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in the
90 application that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426,
91 633.438, 633.4718) Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person
92 to pay to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license
93 renewal fee, rather than an annual or biennial simultaneous license registration fee.
94 Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a reference to the biennial registration of
95 a license.
96 Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain
97 a list of each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain
98 training that each such licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least
99 annually with information received from licensees who renewed their licenses
100 during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13 of this bill requires the
101 Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such information from
102 licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium. Sections 16
103 and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
104 licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure
105 for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
106 Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by
107 the Board. (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of
108 certain fees; (2) increases the amount of certain fees to account for the change from
109 an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and
110 physician assistants; and (3) establishes a biennial license renewal fee and a
111 biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an anesthesiologist assistant.

3 licensee fails to comply with the requirements of NRS 633.471
4 within 10 days after the renewal date, the Board shall give 15 days’
5 notice of the failure to renew the license and of the expiration of the
6 license by certified mail to the licensee at the licensee’s last known
7 address that is registered with the Board. If the license is not
8 renewed within 15 days after receiving notice, the license expires
9 automatically without any further notice or a hearing and the Board
10 shall file a copy of the notice with the Drug Enforcement
11 Administration of the United States Department of Justice or its
12 successor agency.
13 2. A licensee who fails to meet the continuing education
14 requirements for license renewal may apply to the Board for a
15 waiver of the requirements. The Board may grant a waiver for that
16 [year] biennium only if the Board finds that the failure is due to a
17 disability, military service, absence from the United States, or
18 circumstances beyond the control of the licensee which are deemed
19 by the Board to excuse the failure.
20 3. A person whose license has expired under this section may
21 apply to the Board for restoration of the license upon:
22 (a) Payment of all past due renewal fees and the late payment
23 fee specified in NRS 633.501;
24 (b) Producing verified evidence satisfactory to the Board of
25 completion of the total number of hours of continuing education
26 required for the [year] biennium preceding the renewal date and for
27 each [year] biennium succeeding the date of expiration;
28 (c) Stating under oath in writing that he or she has not withheld
29 information from the Board which if disclosed would constitute
30 grounds for disciplinary action under this chapter; and
31 (d) Submitting any other information that is required by the
32 Board to restore the license.
33 Sec. 17. NRS 633.491 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 633.491 1. A licensee who retires from practice is not
35 required [annually] biennially to renew his or her license after filing
36 with the Board an affidavit stating the date on which he or she
37 retired from practice and any other evidence that the Board may
38 require to verify the retirement.
39 2. An osteopathic physician or physician assistant who retires
40 from practice and who desires to return to practice may apply to
41 renew his or her license by paying all back [annual] biennial license
42 renewal fees [or annual registration fees] from the date of retirement
43 and submitting verified evidence satisfactory to the Board that the
44 licensee has attended continuing education courses or programs
45 approved by the Board which total:
-
*AB56_R1*
– 23 –
1 (a) Twenty-five hours if the licensee has been retired 1 year or
2 less.
3 (b) Fifty hours within 12 months of the date of the application if
4 the licensee has been retired for more than 1 year.
5 3. A licensee who wishes to have a license placed on inactive
6 status must provide the Board with an affidavit stating the date on
7 which the licensee will cease the practice of osteopathic medicine or
8 cease to practice as a physician assistant in Nevada and any other
9 evidence that the Board may require. The Board shall place the
10 license of the licensee on inactive status upon receipt of:
11 (a) The affidavit required pursuant to this subsection; and
12 (b) Payment of the inactive license fee prescribed by
13 NRS 633.501.
14 4. An osteopathic physician or physician assistant whose
15 license has been placed on inactive status:
16 (a) Is not required to [annually] biennially renew the license.
17 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, shall

20 (c) Shall not practice osteopathic medicine or practice as a
21 physician assistant in this State.
22 5. A physician assistant whose license has been placed on
23 inactive status shall not practice as a physician assistant. The Board
24 shall consider a physician assistant whose license has been placed
25 on inactive status and who practices as a physician assistant to be
26 practicing without a license. Such practice constitutes grounds for
27 disciplinary action against the physician assistant in accordance with
28 the regulations adopted by the Board pursuant to NRS 633.434.
29 6. The Board shall exempt a physician assistant whose license
30 has been placed on inactive status from paying the inactive license
31 fee prescribed by NRS 633.501.
32 7. An osteopathic physician or physician assistant whose
33 license is on inactive status and who wishes to renew his or her
34 license to practice osteopathic medicine or license to practice as a
35 physician assistant must:
36 (a) Provide to the Board verified evidence satisfactory to the
37 Board of completion of the total number of hours of continuing
38 medical education required for:
39 (1) The [year] biennium preceding the date of the application
40 for renewal of the license; and
41 (2) Each [year] biennium after the date the license was
42 placed on inactive status.
43 (b) Provide to the Board an affidavit stating that the applicant
44 has not withheld from the Board any information which would
45 constitute grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to this chapter.

ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
(ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the licensing of certain
providers of health care. (BDR 54-255)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to providers of health care; revising requirements
for continuing education and training for certain providers
of health care; requiring the Board of Medical Examiners
to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
biennial registration fee; revising the provisions relating
to fees charged and collected by the Board; requiring the
Board, if authorized by a licensee, to provide to an
employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
licensee certain documents and information; setting forth
certain grounds for the State Board of Osteopathic
Medicine to initiate disciplinary action against a licensee
or deny licensure to an applicant; revising requirements
for the issuance by the Board of a license to practice
osteopathic medicine; providing for the biennial renewal
of certain licenses issued by the Board; establishing and
revising certain fees charged by the Board; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain providers of health care licensed by the Board of
2 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to complete
3 certain continuing education as a condition to the renewal of the license. (NRS
4 630.253, 633.471) Section 1 of this bill eliminates provisions requiring the Board
5 of Medical Examiners to require the completion of a course of instruction relating
-
*AB56_R1*

– 2 –
6 to the medical consequences of an act of terrorism that involves the use of a
7 weapon of mass destruction. Section 12 of this bill increases, from 35 to 40, the
8 number of hours of continuing medical education certain providers of health care
9 licensed by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine are required to complete
10 during each period of licensure.
11 Existing law requires the Board of Medical Examiners to adopt regulations
12 regarding the licensure of a physician assistant. (NRS 630.275) Existing law
13 establishes a biennial registration fee for a physician assistant licensed by the
14 Board. (NRS 630.268) Under existing law, the Board is required to exempt a
15 physician assistant on inactive status from paying the biennial registration fee.
16 (NRS 630.255) Section 2 of this bill eliminates that exception. Section 4 of this bill
17 instead requires the Board to require a physician assistant on inactive status to pay a
18 fee for biennial registration. Section 3 of this bill sets forth the maximum amount
19 of that fee.
20 Section 3 revises provisions setting forth the maximum amount of various fees
21 charged by the Board. Section 3 increases the maximum amount of certain fees,
22 removes certain fees and establishes the maximum amount of a fee the Board is
23 required to charge for certain services provided by the Board.
24 Existing law authorizes the Board to keep certain information confidential,
25 including, among other information, any statement, evidence, credential or other
26 proof submitted in support of or to verify the contents of an application for a
27 license. (NRS 630.336) Section 6 of this bill requires the Board, if authorized by a
28 licensee, to provide to an employer of the licensee or an entity credentialing the
29 licensee copies of any documents or other information obtained by the Board
30 during the application process for the issuance of the license of the licensee,
31 including, without limitation, copies of documents and other information verifying
32 the completion by the licensee of any educational program related to licensure and
33 verifying certain other matters concerning the licensee.
34 Existing law sets forth the requirements for the issuance by the State Board of
35 Osteopathic Medicine of a license to practice osteopathic medicine, including,
36 among other requirements, the requirement that an applicant must: (1) have
37 graduated from a school of osteopathic medicine before 1995 and completed a
38 hospital internship or certain postgraduate training; (2) have completed 3 years, or
39 such other length of time as required by certain programs of postgraduate medical
40 education as a resident in the United States or Canada; or (3) be a resident who is
41 enrolled in a postgraduate training program in this State, have completed 24 months
42 of the program and have committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the
43 program. (NRS 633.311) Section 6.7 of this bill revises the requirements for a
44 person who is a resident enrolled in a postgraduate training program to obtain a
45 license to allow a license to be issued to a resident who is enrolled in a postgraduate
46 training program in the United States or Canada that is approved by the Board or
47 certain other organizations who has completed 24 months of the program and who
48 has committed, in writing, that he or she will complete the program. Section 6.7
49 also provides that if, after issuing a license to practice osteopathic medicine, the
50 Board obtains information that differs from the information provided by the
51 applicant or otherwise received by the Board, the Board may take certain action
52 against the applicant.
53 Section 6.3 of this bill provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or
54 attempting to obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice osteopathic medicine
55 by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
56 incomplete statement constitutes grounds for the Board to initiate disciplinary
57 action against a licensee and to deny licensure to an applicant.
58 Existing law, with certain exceptions, provides for the annual renewal of a
59 license to practice osteopathic medicine issued by the State Board of Osteopathic
60 Medicine and sets forth a renewal date for such a license as January 1 of each
-

– 3 –
61 calendar year. (NRS 633.471) Section 12 instead provides, with certain exceptions,
62 for the biennial renewal of such a license and establishes the renewal date for such
63 a license as December 31 of each even-numbered year.
64 Existing regulations provide for the annual renewal of a license as a physician
65 assistant issued by the Board. (NAC 633.285) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill instead
66 provide for the biennial renewal of such a license and establish the renewal date as
67 December 31 of each odd-numbered year. Existing law provides for the biennial
68 renewal of a license as an anesthesiologist assistant issued by the Board. (NRS
69 633.4254) Section 7 of this bill establishes a renewal date for such a license as
70 December 31 of each odd-numbered year.
71 Section 20 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the renewal of certain
72 licenses issued by the Board which are held by a licensee on December 31, 2025.
73 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a person may be simultaneously
74 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the Board of
75 Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (NRS 630.2677,
76 630.26835, 630.2684, 630.26845, 630.2735, 630.2755, 633.4256, 633.4258,
77 633.426, 633.4332, 633.438, 633.4718) Under existing law, a person who is
78 licensed as a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant by the State Board of
79 Osteopathic Medicine and who wishes to be simultaneously licensed by both the
80 Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine is
81 required to: (1) apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice as
82 a physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable; (2) pay all
83 applicable fees, including the fee payable to the Board of Medical Examiners for an
84 application for and the issuance of a simultaneous license as a physician assistant or
85 anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, and the annual simultaneous registration
86 fee for a physician assistant or biennial simultaneous registration fee for an
87 anesthesiologist assistant, as applicable, payable to the State Board of Osteopathic
88 Medicine; and (3) if the person is applying for simultaneous licensure while
89 renewing his or her license, apply to renew his or her license and indicate in the
90 application that he or she wishes to hold a simultaneous license. (NRS 633.426,
91 633.438, 633.4718) Sections 8, 11 and 15 of this bill instead require such a person
92 to pay to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine a biennial simultaneous license
93 renewal fee, rather than an annual or biennial simultaneous license registration fee.
94 Section 14 of this bill similarly eliminates a reference to the biennial registration of
95 a license.
96 Existing law requires the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to: (1) maintain
97 a list of each licensed osteopathic physician and physician assistant and certain
98 training that each such licensee has received; and (2) update the list at least
99 annually with information received from licensees who renewed their licenses
100 during the preceding year. (NRS 633.4715) Section 13 of this bill requires the
101 Board to instead update the list at least biennially with such information from
102 licensees who renewed their licenses during the preceding biennium. Sections 16
103 and 17 of this bill revise certain other procedures and requirements relating to
104 licensure to account for the change from an annual to a biennial period of licensure
105 for certain osteopathic physicians and physician assistants.
106 Existing law sets forth a list of maximum fees to be charged and collected by
107 the Board. (NRS 633.501) Section 18 of this bill: (1) revises the descriptions of
108 certain fees; (2) increases the amount of certain fees to account for the change from
109 an annual to a biennial period of licensure for certain osteopathic physicians and
110 physician assistants; and (3) establishes a biennial license renewal fee and a
111 biennial simultaneous license renewal fee for an anesthesiologist assistant.
