SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to telecommunication
providers. (BDR 58-128)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to telecommunication service; expanding the
circumstances under which certain telecommunication
providers may apply for relief from their status and
obligations as a provider of last resort; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain telecommunication providers, called providers of
2 last resort, to provide basic network service and business line service to any person
3 requesting and eligible to receive such service in a particular service territory. (NRS
4 704.018) Existing law authorizes certain providers of last resort to file an
5 application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to be relieved of their
6 obligation to provide such service in an area where an alternative voice service is
7 provided by a specified number of other providers meeting certain requirements.
8 The term “alternative voice service” for the purposes of these provisions excludes
9 retail voice service that is made available through satellite. (NRS 704.68886) This
10 bill removes the provision excluding retail voice service that is made available
11 through satellite from the definition of “alternative voice service,” thereby allowing
12 providers of retail voice service by satellite to be included among the providers of
13 alternative voice service which may be counted for the purposes of determining
14 whether a provider of last resort may be relieved of its obligation to provide basic
15 network service and business line service to any eligible person within a service
16 territory.

1 9. If the Commission issues an order approving an application

12 11. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any relief
13 granted pursuant to this section does not impose any obligation upon

33 the provider receives money from the fund to maintain the
34 availability of telephone service relating to the provision of service
35 pursuant to the order issued by the Commission pursuant to this
36 paragraph.
37 13. If, as a result of the approval by the Commission of an
38 application filed pursuant to subsection 1, a residential customer
39 does not have access to telephone service, including alternative
40 voice service, the customer may, on or before May 31, 2016, file a
41 request for service with the Commission. Upon receipt of a request,
42 the Commission shall investigate whether such service is available
43 to the customer. If the Commission determines that service is not
44 available, the Commission may order the competitive supplier that
45 received relief pursuant to this section to provide service to the
-

5 alternative voice service as provided in NRS 704.68881.
