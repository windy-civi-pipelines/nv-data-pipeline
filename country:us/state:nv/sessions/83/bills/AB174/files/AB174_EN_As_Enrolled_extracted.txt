Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to telecommunication service; expanding the
circumstances under which certain telecommunication
providers may apply for relief from their status and
obligations as a provider of last resort; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain telecommunication providers, called providers of
last resort, to provide basic network service and business line service to any person
requesting and eligible to receive such service in a particular service territory. (NRS

Section 2:
704.018) Existing law authorizes certain providers of last resort to file an
application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to be relieved of their
obligation to provide such service in an area where an alternative voice service is
provided by a specified number of other providers meeting certain requirements.
The term “alternative voice service” for the purposes of these provisions excludes
retail voice service that is made available through satellite. (NRS 704.68886) This
bill removes the provision excluding retail voice service that is made available
through satellite from the definition of “alternative voice service,” thereby allowing
providers of retail voice service by satellite to be included among the providers of
alternative voice service which may be counted for the purposes of determining
whether a provider of last resort may be relieved of its obligation to provide basic
network service and business line service to any eligible person within a service
territory.
