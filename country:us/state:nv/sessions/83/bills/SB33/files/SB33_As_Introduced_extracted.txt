6 appoint a Chief of the Budget Division; and (2) sets forth certain powers and duties
7 of the Chief relating to the State Budget Act and other provisions of existing law.

11 Existing law also prescribes the qualifications of the Chief and authorizes the
12 Director of the Office of Finance to serve in the position of Chief if the Director
13 possesses those qualifications. (NRS 223.430, 353.175)
