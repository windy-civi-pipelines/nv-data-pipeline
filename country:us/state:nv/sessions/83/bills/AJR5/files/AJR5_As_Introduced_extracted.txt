ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
Nevada Constitution to make the Legislature subject,
when establishing or revising boundaries of any
legislative district, to the same provisions of law that are
enacted by the Legislature and relate to the inspection and
copying of public books and records as any other
governmental entity and to make the Legislature subject
to the same provisions of law that are enacted by the
Legislature and relate to open meetings of public bodies.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution gives exclusive power to each House of the
2 Legislature to determine the rules of its proceedings. (Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 6)
3 Under existing law, all public books and records of a governmental entity, the
4 contents of which are not otherwise declared by law to be confidential, must be
5 open at all times during office hours for inspection and copying by the public.
6 (NRS 239.010) Additionally under existing law, the Open Meeting Law: (1)
7 requires that meetings of public bodies be open and public, with limited exception;
8 (2) sets forth certain requirements for notice of such meetings; and (3) authorizes
9 the Attorney General to interpret and enforce the Open Meeting Law. (Chapter 241
10 of NRS)
11 The Nevada Constitution further provides that it is the mandatory duty of the
12 Legislature after the taking of the decennial census to: (1) fix by law the number of
13 Senators and the number of members of the Assembly; (2) determine the
14 boundaries of legislative districts; and (3) apportion the number of members of the
15 Senate and Assembly in each district. (Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 5)
16 This joint resolution proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to make the
17 Legislature and its members, when establishing or revising the boundaries of any
18 legislative district, subject to the same provisions of law that are enacted by the

6 which they represent, and the number of Senators shall not be

10 first session after the taking of the decennial census of the
11 United States in the year 1950, and after each subsequent
12 decennial census, to fix by law the number of Senators and
13 Assemblymen, and apportion them among the several
14 counties of the State, or among legislative districts which may
15 be established by law, according to the number of inhabitants
16 in them, respectively.
17 3. When establishing or revising the boundaries of any
