ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
Nevada Constitution to make the Legislature subject to
the same provisions of law that are enacted by the
Legislature and relate to the inspection and copying of

entity, to require Legislators to disclose certain
information regarding entities that receive appropriations
in bills, to require the Legislature to publish certain

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution gives exclusive power to each House of the
2 Legislature to determine the rules of its proceedings. (Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 6)
3 Under existing law, all public books and records of a governmental entity, the
4 contents of which are not otherwise declared by law to be confidential, must be
5 open at all times during office hours for inspection and copying by the public.
6 (NRS 239.010) This joint resolution proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to
7 provide, with certain exceptions, that the Legislature and its members are subject to
8 the same provisions of law relating to public books and records.
9 This resolution requires: (1) each Legislator to disclose publicly any
10 relationship that the Legislator or a member of the Legislator’s immediate family
11 has with any entity that receives an appropriation included in a bill; and (2) the
12 Legislature to publish regularly a list of conflict disclosures that, for each
13 Legislator, identifies all personal interests of the Legislator that may result in a
14 conflict of interest.
15 Under existing law, the Open Meeting Law: (1) requires that meetings of public
16 bodies be open to the public, with limited exception; (2) sets forth certain
