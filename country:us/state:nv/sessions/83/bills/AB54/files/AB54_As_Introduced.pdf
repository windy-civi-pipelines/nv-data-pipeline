EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; increasing the penalty for failing
to take certain precautions when approaching a traffic
incident if such a failure proximately causes the death of
or substantial bodily harm to a first responder; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle, in the absence of other direction
2 given by a law enforcement officer, to take certain precautions when approaching
3 any traffic incident, including decreasing the speed of the vehicle, proceeding with
4 caution, being prepared to stop and, if possible, driving in a lane that is not adjacent
5 to the lane or lanes where the traffic incident is located. Existing law makes it a
6 misdemeanor to fail to take such precautions. (NRS 484B.607) This bill increases
7 this penalty by providing that if a person fails to take such precautions upon
8 approaching a traffic incident and that failure is the proximate cause of the death of
9 or substantial bodily harm to a first responder, the person is guilty of a category B
10 felony and shall be punished by: (1) imprisonment in the state prison for a
11 minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 6
12 years; and (2) a fine of not less than $2,000 but not more than $5,000.
