~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to excavations; revising the definition of
“excavation” for the purposes of certain provisions
governing excavations conducted in areas known or
reasonably known to contain subsurface installations; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various requirements for an excavation conducted in
2 an area known or that reasonably should be known to contain a subsurface
3 installation, including prohibiting, with certain exceptions, a person from beginning
4 the excavation, unless the person notifies the appropriate association for operators
5 within a certain period of time. (NRS 455.110)
6 Under existing law, “excavation” is defined to include the movement or
7 removal of earth, rock or other material in or on the ground by use of non-
8 mechanical equipment by any person, other than a contractor, if at any point the
9 movement or removal of such material occurs more than 12 inches below the
10 surface of the original groundline. (NRS 455.092) This bill revises this definition to
11 include the movement or removal of such material that occurs more than 18 inches
12 below the surface of the original groundline. As a result of this change to the
13 definition of “excavation,” the provisions of existing law governing an excavation
14 conducted in an area known or reasonably known to contain a subsurface
15 installation, including the requirement to notify the appropriate association for
16 operators do not apply to the movement or removal of earth, rock or other material
17 that occurs 18 inches or less below the surface of the original groundline.
