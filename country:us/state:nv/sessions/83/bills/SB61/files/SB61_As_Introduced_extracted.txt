Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County),
2 existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners and the city council of
3 each of at least the three largest cities in the county to establish a regional planning
-
*SB61*
– 2 –
4 coalition by cooperative agreement and, if established, develop a comprehensive
5 regional policy plan for the region. (NRS 278.02514, 278.02528) Section 2 of this
6 bill provides that, for the purposes of certain requirements and procedures relating
7 to the annexation or detachment of territory, if a regional planning coalition has not
8 been established, the board of county commissioners must appoint a similar public
9 body that is responsible for the development of comprehensive policy planning in
10 the region to carry out certain duties established for a regional planning coalition.
11 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city located in a county whose
12 population is 700,000 or more to extend the corporate limits of the city by annexing
13 territory using certain procedures. (NRS 268.570-268.608) In a city located in a
14 county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than
15 Clark County), existing law: (1) creates a city annexation commission which
16 reviews proposals for the annexation of territory and adopts procedures for
17 evaluating proposals to annex territory; and (2) authorizes a governing body of the
18 city to diminish, reduce or contract the corporate limits of the city by detaching
19 territory using certain procedures. (NRS 268.626-268.634, 268.664) Section 4 of
20 this bill creates a city annexation and detachment commission in each county
21 whose population is 700,000 or more, consisting of two members representing the
22 county and one member representing each city. Section 5 of this bill establishes the
23 powers and duties of the commission. Section 26 of this bill requires the initial
24 members of the commission to be appointed not later than January 1, 2026, and to
25 serve until December 31, 2026. Section 3 of this bill requires the governing body of
26 each city in such a county to adopt a program of annexation.
27 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the governing body of an incorporated city in
28 a county whose population is 700,000 or more (Cities of Las Vegas, Henderson,
29 North Las Vegas, Mesquite and Boulder City) to detach territory from the corporate
30 limits of the city using certain procedures. Section 18 of this bill authorizes the
31 governing body of the city to initiate detachment proceedings on its own motion or
32 upon the petition of the board of county commissioners or a majority of the owners
33 of real property of the territory sought to be detached.
34 To initiate detachment proceedings, section 6 of this bill requires the governing
35 body of the city to: (1) prepare a plan for the detachment of services and file a
36 report of the plan with the city clerk; and (2) file a petition for detachment with the
37 board of county commissioners. Section 6 requires the board of county
38 commissioners to pass a resolution approving, approving with conditions or
39 disapproving the petition and notify the city clerk of the resolution. If approved or
40 approved with conditions, section 6 requires the city clerk to notify the city
41 annexation and detachment commission created by section 4 not later than 7 days
42 after receiving this resolution.
43 Section 7 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the plan for detachment
44 required by section 6.
45 Under existing law, a city in a county whose population is 700,000 or more that
46 wishes to initiate the annexation of territory must: (1) pass a resolution stating the
47 intent to consider the annexation; and (2) make plans for the extension of services
48 to the territory proposed to be annexed and prepare and file a report setting forth the
49 plans. (NRS 268.578, 268.584) Section 19 of this bill requires the city clerk to
50 transmit a copy of the resolution to the board of county commissioners. Section 16
51 of this bill requires the city clerk to notify the city annexation and detachment
52 commission created by section 4 of the intention of the governing body to initiate
53 an annexation not later than 7 days after this report setting forth the plans for the
54 extension of services is filed. Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change to
55 refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 16.
56 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill establish the process for the regional planning
57 coalition and city annexation and detachment commission to review any proposal to
58 annex or detach territory and requirements for the commission to hold a public
-
*SB61*
– 3 –
59 hearing on the proposal. Section 10 of this bill sets forth the factors the commission
60 must consider when reviewing a proposal. Section 11 of this bill establishes
61 requirements for the commission to approve or disapprove a proposal.
62 If the city annexation and detachment commission approves a proposal to
63 annex or detach territory, section 20 of this bill requires the city clerk to provide
64 notice for a public hearing on the proposal.
65 Existing law requires the governing body of a city in a county whose
66 population is 700,000 or more to: (1) before a public hearing on a proposal to annex
67 territory, approve the report for the expansion of services and make the report
68 available to the public; and (2) at the public hearing, make an explanation of the
69 report. (NRS 268.588, 268.590) Section 21 of this bill removes the requirement for
70 the governing body to approve the report and instead requires the governing body
71 to make the report and findings of the commission available to the public. Sections
72 21 and 22 of this bill require the governing body to perform these actions for a
73 proposal to detach territory.
74 Existing law: (1) prohibits the governing body of a city in a county whose
75 population is 700,000 or more from annexing territory if a majority of the property
76 owners protest the annexation; and (2) authorizes the governing body to annex
77 territory if a majority of property owners do not protest the annexation by adopting
78 an ordinance at a regular or special meeting of the governing body. (NRS 268.592)
79 Section 12 of this bill: (1) establishes similar requirements for a proposal to detach
80 territory from a city in a county whose population is 700,000 or more; and (2)
81 requires the city clerk to file a certified copy of the ordinance and the map showing
82 the territory proposed to be detached and the boundaries of the city proposed to be
83 contracted with the county recorder. Section 13 of this bill establishes provisions
84 for the governing body of the city to determine any outstanding general obligations
85 of the city with respect to the detached territory.
86 Existing law establishes a method to determine the number and identity of
87 owners of real property of a territory proposed to be annexed by a city in a county
88 whose population is 700,000 or more. (NRS 268.594) Section 23 of this bill
89 expands this to owners of real property of a territory proposed to be detached.
90 Existing law authorizes certain persons who appear and protest or file a written
91 protest to an annexation by a city in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
92 to apply to a court for judicial relief. (NRS 268.604) Section 25 of this bill provides
93 that any person, city or county that protests an annexation or detachment may apply
94 for judicial relief.
95 Existing law authorizes a governing body of a city in a county whose
96 population is 700,000 or more to annex territory using certain alternative
97 procedures. (NRS 268.597) Section 28 of this bill repeals the provision authorizing
98 such procedures. Section 17 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a
99 reference to these alternative procedures.
100 Section 14 of this bill defines certain terms relating to annexation and
101 detachment.

9 1. If the territory is annexed to another city, the proportionate
10 obligation must be assumed according to its terms by the annexing
11 city;
12 2. If the territory is not annexed to another city, the board of
13 county commissioners shall levy taxes upon all taxable property in
14 the district, sufficient to discharge the proportionate general
15 obligation according to its terms; or

17 which the obligation was incurred are within the territory

AN ACT relating to cities; requiring, under certain circumstances, a
board of county commissioners in certain counties to
appoint a public body to carry out certain duties of a
regional planning coalition; requiring certain cities to
adopt a program of annexation; creating a city annexation
and detachment commission in certain counties; setting

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County),
2 existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners and the city council of
3 each of at least the three largest cities in the county to establish a regional planning
-
*SB61*

– 2 –
4 coalition by cooperative agreement and, if established, develop a comprehensive
5 regional policy plan for the region. (NRS 278.02514, 278.02528) Section 2 of this
6 bill provides that, for the purposes of certain requirements and procedures relating
7 to the annexation or detachment of territory, if a regional planning coalition has not
8 been established, the board of county commissioners must appoint a similar public
9 body that is responsible for the development of comprehensive policy planning in
10 the region to carry out certain duties established for a regional planning coalition.
11 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city located in a county whose
12 population is 700,000 or more to extend the corporate limits of the city by annexing
13 territory using certain procedures. (NRS 268.570-268.608) In a city located in a
14 county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than
15 Clark County), existing law: (1) creates a city annexation commission which
16 reviews proposals for the annexation of territory and adopts procedures for
17 evaluating proposals to annex territory; and (2) authorizes a governing body of the
18 city to diminish, reduce or contract the corporate limits of the city by detaching
19 territory using certain procedures. (NRS 268.626-268.634, 268.664) Section 4 of
20 this bill creates a city annexation and detachment commission in each county
21 whose population is 700,000 or more, consisting of two members representing the
22 county and one member representing each city. Section 5 of this bill establishes the
23 powers and duties of the commission. Section 26 of this bill requires the initial
24 members of the commission to be appointed not later than January 1, 2026, and to
25 serve until December 31, 2026. Section 3 of this bill requires the governing body of
26 each city in such a county to adopt a program of annexation.
27 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the governing body of an incorporated city in
28 a county whose population is 700,000 or more (Cities of Las Vegas, Henderson,
29 North Las Vegas, Mesquite and Boulder City) to detach territory from the corporate
30 limits of the city using certain procedures. Section 18 of this bill authorizes the
31 governing body of the city to initiate detachment proceedings on its own motion or
32 upon the petition of the board of county commissioners or a majority of the owners
33 of real property of the territory sought to be detached.
34 To initiate detachment proceedings, section 6 of this bill requires the governing
35 body of the city to: (1) prepare a plan for the detachment of services and file a
36 report of the plan with the city clerk; and (2) file a petition for detachment with the
37 board of county commissioners. Section 6 requires the board of county
38 commissioners to pass a resolution approving, approving with conditions or
39 disapproving the petition and notify the city clerk of the resolution. If approved or
40 approved with conditions, section 6 requires the city clerk to notify the city
41 annexation and detachment commission created by section 4 not later than 7 days
42 after receiving this resolution.
43 Section 7 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for the plan for detachment
44 required by section 6.
45 Under existing law, a city in a county whose population is 700,000 or more that
46 wishes to initiate the annexation of territory must: (1) pass a resolution stating the
47 intent to consider the annexation; and (2) make plans for the extension of services
48 to the territory proposed to be annexed and prepare and file a report setting forth the
49 plans. (NRS 268.578, 268.584) Section 19 of this bill requires the city clerk to
50 transmit a copy of the resolution to the board of county commissioners. Section 16
51 of this bill requires the city clerk to notify the city annexation and detachment
52 commission created by section 4 of the intention of the governing body to initiate
53 an annexation not later than 7 days after this report setting forth the plans for the
54 extension of services is filed. Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change to
55 refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 16.
56 Sections 8 and 9 of this bill establish the process for the regional planning
57 coalition and city annexation and detachment commission to review any proposal to
58 annex or detach territory and requirements for the commission to hold a public
-
*SB61*

– 3 –
59 hearing on the proposal. Section 10 of this bill sets forth the factors the commission
60 must consider when reviewing a proposal. Section 11 of this bill establishes
61 requirements for the commission to approve or disapprove a proposal.
62 If the city annexation and detachment commission approves a proposal to
63 annex or detach territory, section 20 of this bill requires the city clerk to provide
64 notice for a public hearing on the proposal.
65 Existing law requires the governing body of a city in a county whose
66 population is 700,000 or more to: (1) before a public hearing on a proposal to annex
67 territory, approve the report for the expansion of services and make the report
68 available to the public; and (2) at the public hearing, make an explanation of the
69 report. (NRS 268.588, 268.590) Section 21 of this bill removes the requirement for
70 the governing body to approve the report and instead requires the governing body
71 to make the report and findings of the commission available to the public. Sections
72 21 and 22 of this bill require the governing body to perform these actions for a
73 proposal to detach territory.
74 Existing law: (1) prohibits the governing body of a city in a county whose
75 population is 700,000 or more from annexing territory if a majority of the property
76 owners protest the annexation; and (2) authorizes the governing body to annex
77 territory if a majority of property owners do not protest the annexation by adopting
78 an ordinance at a regular or special meeting of the governing body. (NRS 268.592)
79 Section 12 of this bill: (1) establishes similar requirements for a proposal to detach
80 territory from a city in a county whose population is 700,000 or more; and (2)
81 requires the city clerk to file a certified copy of the ordinance and the map showing
82 the territory proposed to be detached and the boundaries of the city proposed to be
83 contracted with the county recorder. Section 13 of this bill establishes provisions
84 for the governing body of the city to determine any outstanding general obligations
85 of the city with respect to the detached territory.
86 Existing law establishes a method to determine the number and identity of
87 owners of real property of a territory proposed to be annexed by a city in a county
88 whose population is 700,000 or more. (NRS 268.594) Section 23 of this bill
89 expands this to owners of real property of a territory proposed to be detached.
90 Existing law authorizes certain persons who appear and protest or file a written
91 protest to an annexation by a city in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
92 to apply to a court for judicial relief. (NRS 268.604) Section 25 of this bill provides
93 that any person, city or county that protests an annexation or detachment may apply
94 for judicial relief.
95 Existing law authorizes a governing body of a city in a county whose
96 population is 700,000 or more to annex territory using certain alternative
97 procedures. (NRS 268.597) Section 28 of this bill repeals the provision authorizing
98 such procedures. Section 17 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a
99 reference to these alternative procedures.
100 Section 14 of this bill defines certain terms relating to annexation and
101 detachment.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

6 Sec. 3. 1. The governing body of each city in a county
7 whose population is 700,000 or more shall adopt a program of
8 annexation. The program must identify areas in any sphere of

10 next 7 years. The governing body shall not consider the
11 annexation of any area that is not within the designated sphere of
12 influence and is not included in its program of annexation.
13 2. Before adopting a program of annexation pursuant to
14 subsection 1, the governing body must hold one or more public
15 hearings. Notice of the time and place of the hearing must be
16 mailed to all owners of real property in the proposed program of

32 city.
33 3. The governing body shall submit its program of
34 annexation adopted pursuant to subsection 1 to the regional
35 planning coalition and the county in which the city is located for
36 recommendations.
37 4. The regional planning coalition must certify that a
38 program of annexation adopted pursuant to subsection 1 conforms
39 with the comprehensive regional policy plan, if adopted pursuant
40 to NRS 278.02528, before the program is put into effect. The city
41 may appeal an adverse determination of the regional planning
42 coalition by filing an objection within 45 days after the issuance of
43 that determination. The objection must include the reasons why
44 the program of annexation conforms with the comprehensive
-
*SB61*

– 5 –
1 regional policy plan, if a comprehensive regional policy plan has
2 been adopted.
3 5. The regional planning coalition shall consider any appeal
4 filed pursuant to subsection 4 and issue its final determination of
5 conformance or nonconformance within 45 days after the
6 objection is filed.
7 6. After the regional planning coalition certifies the program
8 of annexation pursuant to subsection 4, any facilities plan, capital
9 improvement program, development project or location of facilities
10 by a county, city, annexation commission, regional planning
11 coalition or any other affected entity must be consistent with the
12 certified program of annexation.
13 Sec. 4. 1. There is hereby created, in each county of the
14 State whose population is 700,000 or more, a city annexation and
15 detachment commission which consists of members to be
16 appointed as follows:

22 governing body.
23 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
24 members of the city annexation and detachment commission serve
25 for terms of 2 years. Any member who ceases to be a member of
26 the body from which the member was chosen ceases to be a
27 member of the commission. A vacancy must be filled for the
28 remainder of the unexpired term by the body which made the
29 original selection.
30 3. The members of the city annexation and detachment
31 commission:
32 (a) Shall elect a chair and vice chair of the commission from
33 among the members; and
34 (b) Serve without compensation.
35 4. The representative of any city incorporated on or after
36 October 1, 2025, must be selected within 30 days after the first
37 meeting of the governing body and must serve until the next
38 ensuing December 31 of an even-numbered year until the

16 Sec. 6. 1. The governing body of any city may, by
17 ordinance, detach and sever from the city any territory within the
18 corporate limits of the city subject to the provisions of this section.
19 To initiate the detachment of any territory on its own motion or
20 upon petition as set forth in NRS 268.582, the governing body
21 shall:
22 (a) Prepare and file with the city clerk a report of a plan for

7 after the date of the resolution disapproving the detachment.
8 Sec. 7. The report of the plan for detachment required by

31 substantially the same basis and in the same manner as such services
32 were provided by the annexing city to the property owners and
33 residents within the remainder of the city on the effective date of the
34 annexation; and
35 (b) At the time the writ is sought, the services set forth in the

14 filing with the city clerk of the annexing or detaching city a written
15 protest to such annexation or detachment, as applicable, within 15
16 days after the conclusion of such public hearing, who believes that
17 [he or she] the person, city or county will suffer material injury, by
18 reason of the failure of the governing body of the [annexing] city to
19 comply with the procedure set forth in NRS 268.570 to 268.608,
20 inclusive, and sections 2 to 13, inclusive, of this act or , for an
21 annexation, to meet the requirements set forth in NRS 268.580 or

25 to apply to the district court having jurisdiction of the annexed or
26 detached territory for an order staying the effectiveness of such
27 [annexation] ordinance.
28 2. Such application shall explicitly state what exceptions are
29 taken to the action of the governing body and what relief the
30 applicant seeks.
31 3. The court shall accord such application precedence over any
32 civil business not involving the public interest.
33 4. In hearing and deciding on such application, the court shall
34 consider any evidence or statements introduced at the public hearing
35 on such annexation [,] or detachment, and any evidence which it
36 finds to have been arbitrarily or capriciously excluded. If the court
37 finds that any of the steps required by NRS 268.570 to 268.608,
38 inclusive, and sections 2 to 13, inclusive, of this act have not been
39 taken or that the governing body has abused its discretion in taking
40 any such action, or that the requirements set forth in NRS 268.580
41 or 268.581, if applicable, have not been met, the court shall make
42 such temporary or final order in the premises as the ends of justice
43 may require.

(b) That, on January 1, 2001, was undeveloped land and was
bounded on at least 75 percent of its aggregate external boundaries
