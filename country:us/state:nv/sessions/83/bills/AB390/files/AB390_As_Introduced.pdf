13 representative, and providers, and set forth procedures and requirements governing
14 such collective bargaining. Section 14 provides that task workers have the right to:
15 (1) organize, form, join or assist task worker organizations, engage in collective
16 bargaining through exclusive bargaining representatives and engage in other
17 concerted activities; and (2) refrain from engaging in such activities.
18 Existing law creates the Government Employee-Management Relations Board
19 and sets forth the powers and duties of the Board concerning collective bargaining
20 between public employees and public employers. (Chapter 288 of NRS) Sections
21 13-35, 43-47, 49 and 50 of this bill expand the powers and duties of the Board to
22 include various powers and duties relating to collective bargaining between task
23 workers and providers. Sections 41, 48 and 49 of this bill change the name of the
24 Board to the Labor Relations Board to conform to this change in powers and duties.
25 Section 15 sets forth certain prohibited practices for task delivery platform
26 providers and task worker organizations, including, among others, the refusal to
27 collectively bargain in good faith concerning the compensation, hours, procedures
28 for the adjustment of grievances and other terms and conditions of work. Section
29 16 sets forth procedures for the Board to hear and decide complaints alleging that a
30 party committed such a prohibited practice.
31 Section 17 requires each provider to submit certain quarterly reports to the
32 Board concerning the task workers with whom the provider has contracted. Section
33 17 additionally requires the Board to maintain a list of each active task worker
34 based on the information provided in such reports.
35 Section 18 requires the Board to establish by regulation industry-wide
36 bargaining units consisting of groups of task workers who have a sufficient
37 community of interest appropriate for representation by a task worker organization
38 for the purpose of collective bargaining.
39 Section 19 sets forth procedures by which a task worker organization may be
40 designated as a recognized bargaining representative of a bargaining unit by the
41 Board. Sections 20 and 21 set forth procedures by which a task worker
42 organization may be certified as the exclusive bargaining representative for a
43 bargaining unit. Section 23 provides that a task worker organization that has been
44 certified as an exclusive bargaining representative remains the exclusive bargaining
45 representative until replaced or decertified in accordance with the procedures set
46 forth in sections 23 and 29. Section 22 sets forth procedures for the conduct of
47 certain elections ordered by the Board relating to the representation of task workers.
48 Section 24 grants an exclusive bargaining representative the exclusive right to
49 engage in collective bargaining with providers who have contracted with task
50 workers within the bargaining unit represented by the exclusive bargaining
51 representative.
52 Section 25 establishes procedures for the deduction from the compensation due
53 to a task worker of amounts for membership dues in a task worker organization.
54 Sections 26-31 set forth procedures and requirements governing the collective
55 bargaining process to reach a recommended agreement between an exclusive
56 bargaining representative of a bargaining unit and the providers who have
57 contracted with task workers within the bargaining unit, including procedures for
58 mediation and arbitration.
59 Section 32 provides that any recommended agreement reached by the parties or
60 the decision of an arbitrator does not become effective until approved by the Labor
61 Commissioner. Section 32 authorizes the Labor Commissioner to approve, with or
62 without modification, or reject any recommended agreement or decision of an
63 arbitrator. If the Labor Commissioner approves an agreement or decision, section
64 32 requires the Labor Commissioner to establish effective and expiration dates for
65 the agreement or decision. Section 33 provides that such an agreement does not
66 preempt or supersede any statute or regulation setting forth labor standards that
67 provide greater benefits or protections to a task worker.

68 Section 34 provides for judicial review of certain determinations and decisions
69 of the Board and Labor Commissioner made pursuant to sections 13-35. Section 35
70 authorizes the Board and the Labor Commissioner to adopt certain regulations.
71 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that
72 constitute a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and authorizes
73 the Attorney General to investigate and take certain actions against persons who
74 engage in such activities, which may include, without limitation, criminal
75 prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS) Under the
76 state action immunity doctrine, private parties engaged in activities that would
77 otherwise violate federal antitrust laws may be immune from such laws if the
78 activity is undertaken pursuant to a “clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed
79 . . . state policy” and the policy is “actively supervised by the State itself.”
80 (California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass’n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97,
81 105 (1980)(internal quotation marks omitted)) Section 13 expresses the intention of
82 the Legislature to exempt activities authorized pursuant to sections 13-35 that may
83 otherwise be constrained by State antitrust laws from such laws and to provide
84 immunity for such activities from federal antitrust laws through the state action
85 immunity doctrine. Section 51 of this bill exempts activities authorized by sections
86 13-35 from the provisions of the Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act.
87 Section 36 of this bill requires a task delivery platform provider to: (1) make
88 certain disclosures to users of the task delivery platform of the provider; and (2)
89 provide a task worker with whom the provider has contracted regular reports
90 concerning the compensation of the task worker.
91 Existing law requires an employer to pay an employee a wage of not less than a
92 certain minimum wage for each hour the employee works. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, §
93 16; NRS 608.250) Existing law requires the Labor Commissioner to administer and
94 enforce the provisions of existing law governing the minimum wage and makes it a
95 misdemeanor for a person to violate those provisions. (NRS 608.270, 608.290)
96 Existing law authorizes an employee who has been paid by an employer a lesser
97 amount than the minimum wage to bring a civil action against the employer. (NRS
98 608.260) Sections 37, 39 and 40 of this bill: (1) require a task delivery platform
99 provider to ensure that a task worker with whom the provider has contracted is paid
100 for each hour the task worker works in performing tasks through the task delivery
101 platform of the provider an amount that is not less than the minimum wage; (2)
102 authorizes a task worker to bring a civil action against a provider who violates that
103 requirement; (3) provides for the administration and enforcement of that
104 requirement by the Labor Commissioner; and (4) makes it a misdemeanor to violate
105 that requirement.
106 Section 38 of this bill sets forth certain requirements and restrictions for
107 contracts between a task worker and a task delivery platform provider.
108 Sections 3-12 of this bill define words and terms relating to task workers.
