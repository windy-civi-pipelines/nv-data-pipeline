~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; revising provisions governing certain
assessments on water users; making an appropriation to
the Division of Water Resources of the State Department
of Conservation and Natural Resources for various
projects relating to the management of water resources in
this State and for the digitization of records and data of
the Division; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of county commissioners of a county to levy a
2 special assessment in an amount necessary to pay the salaries and expenses of well
3 supervisors, assistants of well supervisors and the Well Drillers’ Advisory Board, if
4 fees collected for certain licenses are not sufficient to pay such salaries and
5 expenses. Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county to
6 pay those salaries and expenses by appropriating money from the general fund of
7 the county, if the amount of a special assessment combined with all other taxes and
8 assessments levied upon a property owner is less than the cost of collecting the
9 special assessment. Existing law further provides that well supervisors and
10 assistants of well supervisors employed by the State Engineer are exempt from
11 certain provisions of existing law governing public officers and employees. (NRS
12 534.040) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill prohibit the use of the money levied from
13 such a special assessment or money appropriated from the general fund of a county
14 to pay the salaries and expenses of a person employed by the State Engineer who is
15 subject to certain provisions of existing law governing public officers and
16 employees.

17 Existing law requires such special assessments to be deposited with the State
18 Treasurer for credit to the Water District Account to be accounted for in basin well
19 accounts. (NRS 534.040) Section 3 requires the State Engineer to provide, not
20 more than once each year and upon the written request of a board of county
21 commissioners that levies a special assessment or appropriates money from the
22 general fund of the county, a report on the expenditures and activities from the
23 Water District Account for the particular basin well account of that groundwater
24 basin. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to account for the
25 renumbering of provisions in section 3.
26 Existing law further establishes, subject to certain exceptions, a minimum
27 charge of $1 for a special assessment upon certain areas in which the use of
28 groundwater is predominantly for agricultural purposes. (NRS 534.040) Section 3:
29 (1) removes the minimum charge; and (2) establishes a maximum charge that is
30 equal to the existing charge as of June 30, 2025, plus the annual percentage
31 increase in the Consumer Price Index for the immediately preceding year for such
32 assessments. Section 3 further authorizes the State Engineer to increase the amount
33 of the maximum charge with the approval of the board of county commissioners.
34 Section 4 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Water
35 Resources of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for: (1)
36 costs associated with updates to the water budgets of the groundwater basins in this
37 State; (2) the collection of data and the monitoring of water resources and
38 ecosystems in this State; (3) the digitization of records and data of the Division; and
39 (4) hiring staff for the adjudication of vested water rights in the groundwater basins
40 in this State.

3 Sec. 2. NRS 534.035 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 534.035 1. In each area designated as a groundwater basin by
5 the State Engineer pursuant to the provisions of NRS 534.030, the
6 board of county commissioners may recommend to the State
7 Engineer that the State Engineer establish a groundwater board. The
8 State Engineer shall determine whether or not a groundwater board
9 is to be established and may direct its establishment by order.
10 2. If a groundwater board is established, the governing bodies
11 of all the cities and towns within the designated area, the board of
12 county commissioners of each county in which the area is located,
13 and the governing body of any water district in which the area is
14 included, or partly included, shall each submit a list of names of
15 residents of the area to the Governor, who shall appoint seven
16 members of the board. At least one member must be appointed from
17 each list.
18 3. After the initial terms, the term of office of each member of
19 the board is 4 years. The board shall elect one member as chair and
20 one member as secretary to serve as such at the pleasure of the
21 board.
22 4. The board shall maintain its headquarters at the county seat
23 of the county in which the designated area is located, or if the area
24 lies in more than one county, in the county seat of one of the
25 counties in which the area is located. The board shall hold meetings
26 at such times and places as it may determine. Special meetings may
27 be called at any time by the secretary at the request of any four
28 members, or by the chair, upon notice specifying the matters to be
29 acted upon at the meeting. No matters other than those specified in
30 the notice may be acted upon at that meeting unless all members are
31 present and consent thereto.
32 5. A majority of the board constitutes a quorum, and the board
33 shall act only by a majority of those present.

1 8. It is the intention of the Legislature that the State Engineer
2 and the board be in agreement whenever possible, but, for the
3 purpose of fixing responsibility to the Governor, if there is any
4 disagreement between the State Engineer and the board, the views
5 of the State Engineer prevail. A written report of any such
6 disagreement must be made immediately to the Governor by the
7 State Engineer and the board.
8 9. Any groundwater board may request from the State Engineer
9 or any other state, county, city or district agency such technical
10 information, data and advice as it may require to perform its
11 functions, and the State Engineer and such other agencies shall,
12 within the resources available to them, furnish such assistance as
13 may be requested.
14 10. The Governor may dissolve the groundwater board by
15 order if the Governor determines that the future activities of the
16 board are likely to be insubstantial.
17 Sec. 3. NRS 534.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 534.040 1. Upon the initiation of the administration of this
19 chapter in any particular basin, and where the investigations of the
20 State Engineer have shown the necessity for the supervision over the
21 waters of that basin, the State Engineer may employ a well
22 supervisor and other necessary assistants, who shall execute the
23 duties as provided in this chapter under the direction of the State
24 Engineer. The salaries of the well supervisor and the assistants of
25 the well supervisor must be fixed by the State Engineer. The well
26 supervisor and assistants are exempt from the provisions of chapter
27 284 of NRS.
28 2. If the money available from the license fees provided for in
29 NRS 534.140 is not sufficient to pay those salaries, together with
30 necessary expenses, including the compensation and other expenses
31 of the Well Drillers’ Advisory Board, the board of county
32 commissioners shall, except as otherwise provided in this
33 subsection, levy a special assessment annually, or at such time as the
34 assessment is needed, upon all taxable property situated within the
35 confines of the area designated by the State Engineer to come under
36 the provisions of this chapter in an amount as is necessary to pay
37 such salaries and expenses. If the board of county commissioners
38 determines that the amount of a special assessment levied upon a
39 property owner pursuant to this section when combined with the
40 amount of all other taxes and assessments levied upon the property
41 owner is less than the cost of collecting the special assessment
42 levied pursuant to this subsection, the board of county
43 commissioners may exempt the property owner from the assessment
44 and appropriate money from the general fund of the county to pay
45 the cost of the assessment. Money levied from a special assessment

1 or appropriated from the general fund of a county pursuant to this
2 section must not be used to pay the salaries and expenses of an
3 employee subject to the provisions of chapter 284 of NRS.
4 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in designated
5 areas within which the use of groundwater is predominantly for
6 agricultural purposes, any special assessment levied pursuant to this
7 section must be charged against each water user who has a permit to
8 appropriate water or a perfected water right, and the charge against
9 each water user must be based upon the proportion which his or her
10 water right bears to the aggregate water rights in the designated
11 area. [The minimum charge is $1.] Except as otherwise provided in
12 this subsection, the maximum charge is equal to the existing
13 charge as of June 30, 2025, plus the annual percentage increase
14 in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by the United
15 States Department of Labor for the immediately preceding year.
16 The State Engineer may, with the approval of the board of county
17 commissioners, increase the charge beyond the maximum set forth
18 in this subsection.
19 4. The salaries and expenses may be paid by the State Engineer
20 from the Water Distribution Revolving Account pending the levy
21 and collection of an assessment levied pursuant to this section.
22 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, if a special
23 assessment is levied pursuant to this section, the proper officers of
24 the county shall levy and collect the special assessment as other
25 special assessments are levied and collected, and the assessment is a
26 lien upon the property.
27 6. Any special assessment collected pursuant to this section
28 must be deposited with the State Treasurer for credit to the Water
29 District Account to be accounted for in basin well accounts.
30 7. Not more than once each year, the State Engineer shall
31 provide to a board of county commissioners in this State which
32 levies a special assessment or appropriates money from the
33 general fund of the county pursuant to this section, upon written
34 request from the board of county commissioners, a report on the
35 expenditures and activities from the Water District Account for the
36 particular basin well account of that groundwater basin.
37 8. Upon determination and certification by the State Engineer
38 of the amount to be budgeted for the current or ensuing fiscal year
39 for the purpose of paying the per diem and travel allowances of the
40 groundwater board and employing consultants or other help needed
41 to fulfill its responsibilities, the State Controller shall transfer that
42 amount to a separate operating account for that fiscal year for the
43 groundwater basin. Claims against the account must be approved by
44 the groundwater board and paid as other claims against the State are
45 paid. The State Engineer may use money in a particular basin well

3 responsibilities or activities of the State Engineer regarding the
4 particular groundwater basin.

19 to which money from the appropriation is granted or otherwise
20 transferred in any manner, and any portion of the appropriated
21 money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after

24 granted or transferred, and must be reverted to the State General
25 Fund on or before September 17, 2027.
