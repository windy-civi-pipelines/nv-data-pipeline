SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the crime of vehicular homicide.
(BDR 43-370)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicular homicide; revising the elements required for a person
to commit the crime of vehicular homicide; revising provisions
relating to penalties for certain prohibited acts involving the
operation of a vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of vehicular homicide if the person: (1)
2 drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or
3 certain other substances; (2) proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
4 in actual physical control of a vehicle; and (3) has previously been convicted of at least three
5 offenses. (NRS 484C.130) [This] Section 1.5 of this bill removes the element of having been
6 previously convicted of at least three offenses from the crime of vehicular homicide.
7 Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who drives a vehicle while under the
8 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance and proximately causes substantial bodily
9 harm to another person, rather than substantial bodily harm or death, is guilty of a
10 category B felony and must be punished by: (1) imprisonment in the state prison for a
11 minimum term of not less than 2 years and a maximum term of not more than 20 years;
12 and (2) a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000. (NRS 484C.430) Sections
13 1, 1.2, 1.3, 2-4, 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to certain provisions
14 relating to certain homicides to account for changes made by section 5.

17 medical care for himself, herself or a member of his or her immediate family.
18  Before a restricted license may be issued, the applicant must submit sufficient
19 documentary evidence to satisfy the Department that a severe hardship exists
20 because the applicant has no alternative means of transportation and that the severe
21 hardship outweighs the risk to the public if the applicant is issued a restricted
22 license.
23 2. If the driver’s license of a person assigned to a program established
24 pursuant to NRS 484C.392 is suspended or revoked, the Department may issue a
25 restricted driver’s license to an applicant that is valid while he or she is
26 participating in and complying with the requirements of the program and that

36 Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
37 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:

39 or
40 (b) If applicable, to and from school.

49 subsection 1 or 2 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, if the license of the driver was

8 chapter and NRS 484C.210 must run consecutively, except as otherwise provided

10 7. Whenever the Department suspends or revokes a license, the period of
11 suspension, or of ineligibility for a license after the revocation, begins upon the
12 effective date of the revocation or suspension as contained in the notice thereof.
13 8. Any person for whom a court provides an exception relating to the
14 installation of an ignition interlock device pursuant to subsection 4 of NRS

49 to a lesser charge or for any other reason, unless the prosecutor believes the charge
50 is not supported by probable cause or cannot be proved at trial. The provisions of
51 this subsection do not apply if the period of revocation has expired but the person
52 has not reinstated the license.

5 However, the full term of imprisonment must be served within 6 months after the
6 date of conviction, and any segment of time the person is imprisoned must not
7 consist of less than 24 hours.

10 5. If the Department receives a record of the conviction or punishment of any
11 person pursuant to this section upon a charge of driving a vehicle while the person’s
12 license was:
13 (a) Suspended, the Department shall extend the period of the suspension for an
14 additional like period.

32 person with an alcohol or other substance use disorder shall make a report and
33 recommendation to the court concerning the length and type of treatment required

39 3. At the hearing on the application for treatment, the prosecuting attorney
40 may present the court with any relevant evidence on the matter. If a hearing is not
41 held, the court shall decide the matter and other information before the court.
42 4. If the court determines that an application for treatment should be granted,
43 the court shall:

45 consent of the offender, suspend further proceedings and place the offender on
46 probation for not more than 5 years.

16  An offender who is imprisoned pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
17 must, insofar as practicable, be segregated from offenders whose crimes were
18 violent and, insofar as practicable, be assigned to an institution or facility of
19 minimum security.
20 2. An offense that occurred within 7 years immediately preceding the date of
21 the principal offense or after the principal offense constitutes a prior offense for the
22 purposes of this section:
23 (a) When evidenced by a conviction; or
24 (b) If the offense is conditionally dismissed or the judgment of conviction is set
25 aside pursuant to NRS 176A.240, 176A.260 or 176A.290 or dismissed in
26 connection with successful completion of a diversionary program or specialty court

46 5. If the defendant was transporting a person who is less than 15 years of age
47 in the motor vehicle at the time of the violation, the court shall consider that fact as
48 an aggravating factor in determining the sentence of the defendant.

51 any such offense, the offender is imprisoned, serving a term of residential
52 confinement, placed under the supervision of a treatment provider, on parole or on

33 1 that occurred on any date preceding the date of the principal offense or after the
34 principal offense constitutes a prior offense for the purposes of this section when
35 evidenced by a conviction, without regard for the sequence of the offenses and
36 convictions. The facts concerning a prior offense must be alleged in the complaint,
37 indictment or information, must not be read to the jury or proved at trial but must
38 be proved at the time of sentencing and, if the principal offense is alleged to be a
39 felony, must also be shown at the preliminary examination or presented to the grand

47 sentence of 30 days or less must be served within 6 months after the date of
48 conviction or, if the offender was sentenced pursuant to NRS 484C.320 or
49 484C.330 and the suspension of offender’s sentence was revoked, within 6 months

2 in the motor vehicle at the time of the violation, the court shall consider that fact as
3 an aggravating factor in determining the sentence of the defendant.
4 6. For the purpose of determining whether one offense occurs within 7 years
5 of another offense, any period of time between the two offenses during which, for
6 any such offense, the offender is imprisoned, serving a term of residential
7 confinement, placed under the supervision of a treatment provider, on parole or on
8 probation must be excluded.
9 7. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, “offense”
10 means:
11 (a) A violation of NRS 484C.110, 484C.120 or 484C.430;
12 (b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical control of a

18 Sec. 5. NRS 484C.430 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 484C.430 1. [Unless a greater penalty is provided pursuant to NRS
20 484C.440, a] A person who:
21 (a) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
22 (b) Has a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her blood or breath;

32 (f) Has a prohibited substance in his or her blood or urine, as applicable, in an
33 amount that is equal to or greater than the amount set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of

49 suspended nor may probation be granted.
50 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if consumption is proven by
51 a preponderance of the evidence, it is an affirmative defense under paragraph (c) of

4 the trial or hearing or at such other time as the court may direct, file and serve on
5 the prosecuting attorney a written notice of that intent.
6 4. If the defendant is also charged with violating the provisions of NRS

8 defense set forth in subsection 3.
9 5. If the defendant was transporting a person who is less than 15 years of age
10 in the motor vehicle at the time of the violation, the court shall consider that fact as
11 an aggravating factor in determining the sentence of the defendant.
12 Sec. 6. NRS 458.260 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 458.260 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the use of alcohol,
14 the status of drunkard and the fact of being found in an intoxicated condition are

33 criminal act.
34 Sec. 7. NRS 458.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 458.270 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, a person who is
36 found in any public place under the influence of alcohol, in such a condition that
37 the person is unable to exercise care for his or her health or safety or the health or
38 safety of other persons, must be placed under civil protective custody by a peace
39 officer.
40 2. A peace officer may use upon such a person the kind and degree of force
41 which would be lawful if the peace officer were effecting an arrest for a
42 misdemeanor with a warrant.
43 3. If a licensed facility for the treatment of persons with an alcohol use
44 disorder that has been certified by the Division for civil protective custody exists in
45 the community where the person is found, the person must be delivered to the
46 facility for observation and care. If no such facility exists in the community, the
47 person so found may be placed in a county or city jail or detention facility for
48 shelter or supervision for his or her health and safety until he or she is no longer

50 will to remain in a licensed facility, jail or detention facility longer than 48 hours.
51 4. An intoxicated person taken into custody by a peace officer for a public
52 offense must immediately be taken to a secure detoxification unit or other
53 appropriate medical facility if the condition of the person appears to require
Senate Amendment No. 246 to Senate Bill No. 304 Page 15
1 emergency medical treatment. Upon release from the detoxification unit or medical
2 facility, the person must immediately be remanded to the custody of the
3 apprehending peace officer and the criminal proceedings proceed as prescribed by
4 law.
5 5. The placement of a person found under the influence of alcohol in civil
6 protective custody must be:
7 (a) Recorded at the facility, jail or detention facility to which the person is
8 delivered; and
9 (b) Communicated at the earliest practical time to the person’s family or next
10 of kin if they can be located.

13 7. The provisions of this section do not apply to a person who is apprehended
14 or arrested for:
15 (a) A civil or administrative violation for which intoxication is an element of
16 the violation pursuant to the provisions of a specific statute or regulation;

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the crime of vehicular homicide.
(BDR 43-370)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicular homicide; revising the elements required for a person
to commit the crime of vehicular homicide; revising provisions
relating to penalties for certain prohibited acts involving the
operation of a vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of vehicular homicide if the person: (1)
2 drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or
3 certain other substances; (2) proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
4 in actual physical control of a vehicle; and (3) has previously been convicted of at least three
5 offenses. (NRS 484C.130) [This] Section 1.5 of this bill removes the element of having been
6 previously convicted of at least three offenses from the crime of vehicular homicide.
7 Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who drives a vehicle while under the
8 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance and proximately causes substantial bodily
9 harm to another person, rather than substantial bodily harm or death, is guilty of a
10 category B felony and must be punished by: (1) imprisonment in the state prison for a
11 minimum term of not less than 2 years and a maximum term of not more than 20 years;
12 and (2) a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000. (NRS 484C.430) Sections
13 1, 1.2, 1.3, 2-4, 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to certain provisions
14 relating to certain homicides to account for changes made by section 5.

34 prohibited by NRS 484C.110 [,] or 484C.130 . [or 484C.430.]
35  The period during which such a driver is not eligible for a license, permit or
36 privilege to drive must be set aside during any period of imprisonment and the
37 period of revocation must resume when the Department is notified pursuant to NRS
38 209.517 or 213.12185 that the person has completed the period of imprisonment or
39 that the person has been placed on residential confinement or parole.
40 (d) For a period of 5 years if the offense is a second or subsequent violation of

52 reduce by one-half the period during which the person is not eligible for a license,

Senate Amendment No. 246 to Senate Bill No. 304 Page 5
1 permit or privilege to drive, but shall restore that reduction in time if notified that
2 the person was not accepted for or failed to complete the treatment.
3 4. In addition to any other requirements set forth by specific statute, if the
4 Department is notified that a court has ordered the revocation, suspension or delay
5 in the issuance of a license pursuant to title 5 of NRS, NRS 206.330 or 392.148,
6 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS or any other provision of law, the
7 Department shall take such actions as are necessary to carry out the court’s order.
8 Sec. 1.2. NRS 483.490 is hereby amended to read as follows:
9 483.490 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, after a driver’s
10 license has been suspended or revoked and one-half of the period during which the
11 driver is not eligible for a license has expired, the Department may, unless the
12 statute authorizing the suspension or revocation prohibits the issuance of a
13 restricted license, issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
14 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
15 (a) To and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both; or
16 (b) To acquire supplies of medicine or food or receive regularly scheduled
17 medical care for himself, herself or a member of his or her immediate family.
18  Before a restricted license may be issued, the applicant must submit sufficient
19 documentary evidence to satisfy the Department that a severe hardship exists
20 because the applicant has no alternative means of transportation and that the severe
21 hardship outweighs the risk to the public if the applicant is issued a restricted
22 license.
23 2. If the driver’s license of a person assigned to a program established
24 pursuant to NRS 484C.392 is suspended or revoked, the Department may issue a
25 restricted driver’s license to an applicant that is valid while he or she is
26 participating in and complying with the requirements of the program and that
27 permits the applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
28 (a) To and from a testing location established by a designated law enforcement
29 agency pursuant to NRS 484C.393;
30 (b) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
31 (c) To and from court appearances;
32 (d) To and from counseling; or
33 (e) To receive regularly scheduled medical care for himself or herself.
34 3. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 62E.630, after a driver’s license has
35 been revoked or suspended pursuant to title 5 of NRS or NRS 392.148, the
36 Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
37 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
38 (a) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
39 or
40 (b) If applicable, to and from school.
41 4. After a driver’s license has been suspended pursuant to NRS 483.443, the
42 Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
43 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
44 (a) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
45 (b) To receive regularly scheduled medical care for himself, herself or a
46 member of his or her immediate family; or
47 (c) If applicable, as necessary to exercise a court-ordered right to visit a child.
48 5. A driver who violates a condition of a restricted license issued pursuant to
49 subsection 1 or 2 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, if the license of the driver was
50 suspended or revoked for:
51 (a) A violation of NRS 484C.110, 484C.210 or 484C.430;
52 (b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical control of a
53 vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or

Senate Amendment No. 246 to Senate Bill No. 304 Page 6
1 resulting from any other conduct prohibited by NRS 484C.110 [,] or 484C.130 ; [or
2 484C.430;] or
3 (c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same or
4 similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b),
5  the driver shall be punished in the manner provided pursuant to subsection 2 of
6 NRS 483.560.
7 6. The periods of suspensions and revocations required pursuant to this
8 chapter and NRS 484C.210 must run consecutively, except as otherwise provided
9 in NRS 483.465 and 483.475, when the suspensions must run concurrently.
10 7. Whenever the Department suspends or revokes a license, the period of
11 suspension, or of ineligibility for a license after the revocation, begins upon the
12 effective date of the revocation or suspension as contained in the notice thereof.
13 8. Any person for whom a court provides an exception relating to the
14 installation of an ignition interlock device pursuant to subsection 4 of NRS
15 484C.210 or subsection 2 of NRS 484C.460 is eligible for a restricted driver’s
16 license under this section while the person is participating in and complying with
17 the requirements of a program established pursuant to NRS 484C.392.
18 9. If the Department receives a copy of an order requiring a person to install
19 an ignition interlock device in a motor vehicle pursuant to NRS 484C.460, the
20 Department shall issue an ignition interlock privilege to the person after he or she
21 submits proof of compliance with the order. A person who is required to install an
22 ignition interlock device pursuant to NRS 484C.210 or 484C.460 shall install the
23 device not later than 14 days after the date on which the order was issued. A driver
24 who violates any condition of an ignition interlock privilege issued pursuant to this
25 subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the same manner
26 provided in subsection 2 of NRS 483.560 for driving a vehicle while a driver’s
27 license is cancelled, revoked or suspended.
28 Sec. 1.3. NRS 483.560 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 483.560 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, any person who
30 drives a motor vehicle on a highway or on premises to which the public has access
31 at a time when the person’s driver’s license has been cancelled, revoked or
32 suspended is guilty of a misdemeanor.
33 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the license of the person
34 was suspended, revoked or restricted because of:
35 (a) A violation of NRS 484C.110, 484C.120, 484C.210 or 484C.430;
36 (b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical control of a
37 vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or
38 resulting from any other conduct prohibited by NRS 484C.110 [,] or 484C.130 , [or
39 484C.430;] or
40 (c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same or
41 similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b),
42  the person shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for not less than 30 days nor
43 more than 6 months or by serving a term of residential confinement for not less
44 than 60 days nor more than 6 months, and shall be further punished by a fine of not
45 less than $500 nor more than $1,000. A person who is punished pursuant to this
46 subsection may not be granted probation, and a sentence imposed for such a
47 violation may not be suspended. A prosecutor may not dismiss a charge of such a
48 violation in exchange for a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill or nolo contendere
49 to a lesser charge or for any other reason, unless the prosecutor believes the charge
50 is not supported by probable cause or cannot be proved at trial. The provisions of
51 this subsection do not apply if the period of revocation has expired but the person
52 has not reinstated the license.

Senate Amendment No. 246 to Senate Bill No. 304 Page 7
1 3. A term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section
2 may be served intermittently at the discretion of the judge or justice of the peace.
3 This discretion must be exercised after considering all the circumstances
4 surrounding the offense, and the family and employment of the person convicted.
5 However, the full term of imprisonment must be served within 6 months after the
6 date of conviction, and any segment of time the person is imprisoned must not
7 consist of less than 24 hours.
8 4. Jail sentences simultaneously imposed pursuant to this section and NRS
9 484C.320, 484C.330, 484C.400, 484C.410 or 484C.420 must run consecutively.
10 5. If the Department receives a record of the conviction or punishment of any
11 person pursuant to this section upon a charge of driving a vehicle while the person’s
12 license was:
13 (a) Suspended, the Department shall extend the period of the suspension for an
14 additional like period.
15 (b) Revoked, the Department shall extend the period of ineligibility for a
16 license, permit or privilege to drive for an additional 1 year.
17 (c) Restricted, the Department shall revoke the restricted license and extend the
18 period of ineligibility for a license, permit or privilege to drive for an additional 1
19 year.
20 (d) Suspended or cancelled for an indefinite period, the Department shall
21 suspend the license for an additional 6 months for the first violation and an
22 additional 1 year for each subsequent violation.
23 6. Suspensions and revocations imposed pursuant to this section must run
24 consecutively.
25 [Section 1.] Sec. 1.5. NRS 484C.130 is hereby amended to read as
26 follows:
27 484C.130 1. A person commits vehicular homicide if the person:
28 (a) Drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle on or off the highways of
29 this State and:
30 (1) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
31 (2) Has a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her blood or
32 breath;
33 (3) Is found by measurement within 2 hours after driving or being in actual
34 physical control of a vehicle to have a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in
35 his or her blood or breath;
36 (4) Is under the influence of a controlled substance or is under the
37 combined influence of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance;
38 (5) Inhales, ingests, applies or otherwise uses any chemical, poison or
39 organic solvent, or any compound or combination of any of these, to a degree
40 which renders the person incapable of safely driving or exercising actual physical
41 control of a vehicle; or
42 (6) Has a prohibited substance in his or her blood or urine, as applicable, in
43 an amount that is equal to or greater than the amount set forth in subsection 3 or 4
44 of NRS 484C.110; and
45 (b) Proximately causes the death of another person while driving or in actual
46 physical control of a vehicle on or off the highways of this State . [; and
47 (c) Has previously been convicted of at least three offenses.]
48 2. If consumption is proven by a preponderance of the evidence, it is an
49 affirmative defense under subparagraph (3) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1 that the
50 defendant consumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol after driving or being in actual
51 physical control of the vehicle, and before his or her blood or breath was tested, to
52 cause the defendant to have a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her
53 blood or breath. A defendant who intends to offer this defense at a trial or

Senate Amendment No. 246 to Senate Bill No. 304 Page 8
1 preliminary hearing must, not less than 14 days before the trial or hearing or at such
2 other time as the court may direct, file and serve on the prosecuting attorney a
3 written notice of that intent.
4 [3. As used in this section, “offense” means:
5 (a) A violation of NRS 484C.110, 484C.120 or 484C.430;
6 (b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical control of a
7 vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or
8 resulting from any other conduct prohibited by this section or NRS 484C.110 or
9 484C.430; or
10 (c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same or
11 similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b).]
12 Sec. 2. NRS 484C.340 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 484C.340 1. An offender who enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a
14 violation of NRS 484C.110 or 484C.120 that is punishable pursuant to paragraph
15 (c) of subsection 1 of NRS 484C.400 may, at the time the offender enters a plea,
16 apply to the court to undergo a program of treatment for an alcohol or other
17 substance use disorder for at least 3 years. The court may authorize that treatment
18 if:
19 (a) The offender is diagnosed as a person with an alcohol or other substance
20 use disorder by:
21 (1) An alcohol and drug counselor who is licensed or certified, or a clinical
22 alcohol and drug counselor who is licensed, pursuant to chapter 641C of NRS, to
23 make that diagnosis;
24 (2) A physician who is certified to make that diagnosis by the Board of
25 Medical Examiners;
26 (3) An advanced practice registered nurse who is certified to make that
27 diagnosis by the State Board of Nursing; and
28 (b) The offender agrees to pay the costs of the treatment to the extent of his or
29 her financial resources.
30  An alcohol and drug counselor, a clinical alcohol and drug counselor, a
31 physician or an advanced practice registered nurse who diagnoses an offender as a
32 person with an alcohol or other substance use disorder shall make a report and
33 recommendation to the court concerning the length and type of treatment required
34 for the offender.
35 2. A prosecuting attorney may, within 10 days after receiving notice of an
36 application for treatment pursuant to this section, request a hearing on the matter.
37 The court shall order a hearing on the application upon the request of the
38 prosecuting attorney or may order a hearing on its own motion.
39 3. At the hearing on the application for treatment, the prosecuting attorney
40 may present the court with any relevant evidence on the matter. If a hearing is not
41 held, the court shall decide the matter and other information before the court.
42 4. If the court determines that an application for treatment should be granted,
43 the court shall:
44 (a) Immediately, without entering a judgment of conviction and with the
45 consent of the offender, suspend further proceedings and place the offender on
46 probation for not more than 5 years.
47 (b) Order the offender to complete a program of treatment for an alcohol or
48 other substance use disorder with a treatment provider approved by the court. If the
49 court has a specialty court program for the supervision and monitoring of the
50 person, the treatment provider must comply with the requirements of the specialty
51 court, including, without limitation, any requirement to submit progress reports to
52 the specialty court.
53 (c) Advise the offender that:

Senate Amendment No. 246 to Senate Bill No. 304 Page 9
1 (1) He or she may be placed under the supervision of a treatment provider
2 for not more than 5 years.
3 (2) The court may order the offender to be admitted to a residential
4 treatment facility.
5 (3) The court will enter a judgment of conviction for a violation of
6 paragraph (c) of subsection 1 of NRS 484C.400 if a treatment provider fails to
7 accept the offender for a program of treatment for an alcohol or other substance use
8 disorder or if the offender fails to complete the program of treatment satisfactorily.
9 Any sentence of imprisonment may be reduced by a time equal to that which the
10 offender served before beginning treatment.
11 (4) If the offender completes the treatment satisfactorily, the court will
12 enter a judgment of conviction for a violation of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of
13 NRS 484C.400.
14 (5) The provisions of NRS 483.460 requiring the revocation of the license,
15 permit or privilege of the offender to drive do not apply.
16 5. The court shall administer the program of treatment pursuant to the
17 procedures provided in NRS 176A.230 to 176A.245, inclusive, except that the
18 court:
19 (a) Shall not defer the sentence or set aside the conviction upon the election of
20 treatment, except as otherwise provided in this section; and
21 (b) May enter a judgment of conviction and proceed as provided in paragraph
22 (c) of subsection 1 of NRS 484C.400 for a violation of a condition ordered by the
23 court.
24 6. To participate in a program of treatment, the offender must:
25 (a) Serve not less than 6 months of residential confinement;
26 (b) Be placed under a system of active electronic monitoring, through the
27 Division, that is capable of identifying the offender’s location and producing, upon
28 request, reports or records of the offender’s presence near or within, or departure
29 from, a specified geographic location and pay any costs associated with the
30 offender’s participation under the system of active electronic monitoring;
31 (c) Install, at his or her own expense, an ignition interlock device for not less
32 than 12 months;
33 (d) Not drive any vehicle unless it is equipped with an ignition interlock
34 device;
35 (e) Agree to be subject to periodic testing for the use of alcohol or controlled
36 substances while participating in a program of treatment; and
37 (f) Agree to any other conditions that the court deems necessary.
38 7. An offender may not apply to the court to undergo a program of treatment
39 for an alcohol or other substance use disorder pursuant to this section if the offender
40 has previously applied to receive treatment pursuant to this section or if the
41 offender has previously been convicted of:

5 of another offense, any period of time between the two offenses during which, for
6 any such offense, the offender is imprisoned, serving a term of residential
7 confinement, placed under the supervision of a treatment provider, on parole or on
8 probation must be excluded.
9 7. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, “offense”

38 safety of other persons, must be placed under civil protective custody by a peace
39 officer.
40 2. A peace officer may use upon such a person the kind and degree of force
41 which would be lawful if the peace officer were effecting an arrest for a
42 misdemeanor with a warrant.
43 3. If a licensed facility for the treatment of persons with an alcohol use
44 disorder that has been certified by the Division for civil protective custody exists in
45 the community where the person is found, the person must be delivered to the
46 facility for observation and care. If no such facility exists in the community, the

1 emergency medical treatment. Upon release from the detoxification unit or medical
2 facility, the person must immediately be remanded to the custody of the
