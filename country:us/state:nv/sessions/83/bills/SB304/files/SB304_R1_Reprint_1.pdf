SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the crime of vehicular
homicide. (BDR 43-370)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicular homicide; revising the elements
required for a person to commit the crime of vehicular
homicide; revising provisions relating to penalties for
certain prohibited acts involving the operation of a
vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of vehicular homicide if the
2 person: (1) drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the
3 influence of alcohol or certain other substances; (2) proximately causes the death of
4 another person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle; and (3) has
5 previously been convicted of at least three offenses. (NRS 484C.130) Section 1.5
6 of this bill removes the element of having been previously convicted of at least
7 three offenses from the crime of vehicular homicide.
8 Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who drives a vehicle while under
9 the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance and proximately causes
10 substantial bodily harm to another person, rather than substantial bodily harm or
11 death, is guilty of a category B felony and must be punished by: (1) imprisonment
12 in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 2 years and a maximum term
13 of not more than 20 years; and (2) a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than
14 $5,000. (NRS 484C.430) Sections 1, 1.2, 1.3, 2-4, 6 and 7 of this bill make

20 paragraph must, insofar as practicable, be segregated from offenders

11 Sec. 5. NRS 484C.430 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 484C.430 1. [Unless a greater penalty is provided pursuant to
13 NRS 484C.440, a] A person who:
14 (a) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
15 (b) Has a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her
16 blood or breath;

7 for his or her health or safety or the health or safety of other persons,
8 must be placed under civil protective custody by a peace officer.
9 2. A peace officer may use upon such a person the kind and
10 degree of force which would be lawful if the peace officer were
11 effecting an arrest for a misdemeanor with a warrant.
12 3. If a licensed facility for the treatment of persons with an
13 alcohol use disorder that has been certified by the Division for civil
14 protective custody exists in the community where the person is

20 required against his or her will to remain in a licensed facility, jail or
21 detention facility longer than 48 hours.
22 4. An intoxicated person taken into custody by a peace officer
23 for a public offense must immediately be taken to a secure
24 detoxification unit or other appropriate medical facility if the
25 condition of the person appears to require emergency medical
26 treatment. Upon release from the detoxification unit or medical
27 facility, the person must immediately be remanded to the custody of

29 proceed as prescribed by law.
30 5. The placement of a person found under the influence of
