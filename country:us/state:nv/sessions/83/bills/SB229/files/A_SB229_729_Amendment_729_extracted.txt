EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising requirements for a pupil to be awarded a
State Seal of Financial Literacy; making certain requirements relating
to the provision of instruction in financial literacy to pupils enrolled in
grades 3 to 12, inclusive, applicable to the provision of such instruction
to pupils enrolled in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a State Seal of
2 Financial Literacy Program to recognize certain pupils who have attained a high level of
3 proficiency in financial literacy. (NRS 388.596) Existing law requires a school that
4 participates in the State Seal of Financial Literacy Program to award a pupil, upon graduation
5 from high school, a high school diploma with a State Seal of Financial Literacy if the pupil:
6 (1) earns at least a 3.25 grade point average, on a 4.0 grading school, or a 3.85 weighted grade
7 point average, on a grading scale approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction if a
8 different grading scale is used; and (2) demonstrates proficiency in financial literacy. Existing
9 law provides that a student demonstrates proficiency in financial literacy by earning: (1) at
10 least 3 credits in a subject area in which instruction on financial literacy is provided; and (2)
11 either earning a grade of B or higher in a college-level course in which instruction on financial
12 literacy is provided or earning a score of gold or higher on the ACT National Career
13 Readiness Certificate. (NRS 388.5962) Section 1 of this bill lowers the grade point average
14 that a student must earn to a [2.5] 3.0 grade point average, on a 4.0 scale, or a [2.5] 3.0
15 weighted grade point average, on a grading scale approved by the Superintendent of Public
16 Instruction if a different scale is used. Section 1 further revises the requirements for a student
17 to demonstrate proficiency in financial literacy by instead providing that a student
18 demonstrates such proficiency if he or she earns at least 3 credits in a course of career and
19 technical education, mathematics or socials studies which relates to financial literacy and: (1)
20 earns a grade of B or higher in a college-level course, including, without limitation, a dual
21 credit course, in which instruction on financial literacy is provided; (2) earns a score of at least
22 85 percent on a financial literacy assessment provided by the Department of Education; or (3)
Senate Amendment No. 729 to Senate Bill No. 229 Page 4
23 completes an objective test, exam or project which relates to financial literacy and is provided
24 by certain career and technical student organizations.
25 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
26 of each charter school to ensure that instruction in financial literacy is provided to pupils
27 enrolled in grades 3 to 12, inclusive, in each public school within the school district or in the
28 charter school, as applicable. (NRS 389.074) Section 2 of this bill instead requires such
29 entities to ensure that such instruction is provided to pupils enrolled in kindergarten and
30 grades 1 to 12, inclusive, in such schools.
31 Existing law further requires the board of trustees of each school district, each school
32 district and the governing body of each charter school in which pupils are enrolled in any
33 grade of grades 3 to 12, inclusive, to take certain actions to assist in the provision of
34 instruction in financial literacy, including: (1) encouraging certain persons, businesses and
35 entities to provide certain resources; and (2) providing professional development training
36 regarding financial literacy to certain teachers. (NRS 389.074, 391A.385) Sections 2 and 3 of
37 this bill instead require the board of trustees of each school district, each school district and
38 the governing body of each charter school in which pupils are enrolled in kindergarten or any
39 grade of grades 1 to 12, inclusive, to take these actions.
