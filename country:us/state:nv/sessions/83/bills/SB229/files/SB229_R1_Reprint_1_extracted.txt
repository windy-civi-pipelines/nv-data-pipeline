EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising requirements for a pupil to
be awarded a State Seal of Financial Literacy; making
certain requirements relating to the provision of
instruction in financial literacy to pupils enrolled in

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a
2 State Seal of Financial Literacy Program to recognize certain pupils who have
3 attained a high level of proficiency in financial literacy. (NRS 388.596) Existing
4 law requires a school that participates in the State Seal of Financial Literacy
5 Program to award a pupil, upon graduation from high school, a high school diploma
6 with a State Seal of Financial Literacy if the pupil: (1) earns at least a 3.25 grade
7 point average, on a 4.0 grading school, or a 3.85 weighted grade point average, on a
8 grading scale approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction if a different
9 grading scale is used; and (2) demonstrates proficiency in financial literacy.
10 Existing law provides that a student demonstrates proficiency in financial literacy
11 by earning: (1) at least 3 credits in a subject area in which instruction on financial
12 literacy is provided; and (2) either earning a grade of B or higher in a college-level
13 course in which instruction on financial literacy is provided or earning a score of
-

14 gold or higher on the ACT National Career Readiness Certificate. (NRS 388.5962)
15 Section 1 of this bill lowers the grade point average that a student must earn to a
16 3.0 grade point average, on a 4.0 scale, or a 3.0 weighted grade point average, on a
17 grading scale approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction if a different
18 scale is used. Section 1 further revises the requirements for a student to
19 demonstrate proficiency in financial literacy by instead providing that a student
20 demonstrates such proficiency if he or she earns at least 3 credits in a course of
21 career and technical education, mathematics or socials studies which relates to
22 financial literacy and: (1) earns a grade of B or higher in a college-level course,
23 including, without limitation, a dual credit course, in which instruction on financial

25 assessment provided by the Department of Education; or (3) completes an objective
26 test, exam or project which relates to financial literacy and is provided by certain
27 career and technical student organizations.
28 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
29 governing body of each charter school to ensure that instruction in financial literacy
30 is provided to pupils enrolled in grades 3 to 12, inclusive, in each public school
31 within the school district or in the charter school, as applicable. (NRS 389.074)
32 Section 2 of this bill instead requires such entities to ensure that such instruction is
33 provided to pupils enrolled in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, in such
34 schools.
35 Existing law further requires the board of trustees of each school district, each
36 school district and the governing body of each charter school in which pupils are
37 enrolled in any grade of grades 3 to 12, inclusive, to take certain actions to assist in
38 the provision of instruction in financial literacy, including: (1) encouraging certain
39 persons, businesses and entities to provide certain resources; and (2) providing
40 professional development training regarding financial literacy to certain teachers.
41 (NRS 389.074, 391A.385) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill instead require the board of
42 trustees of each school district, each school district and the governing body of each
43 charter school in which pupils are enrolled in kindergarten or any grade of grades 1
44 to 12, inclusive, to take these actions.
