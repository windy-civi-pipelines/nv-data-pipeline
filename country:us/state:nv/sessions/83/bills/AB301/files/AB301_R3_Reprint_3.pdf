Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the creation of a general
2 improvement district to provide certain governmental services and facilities to the
3 residents of the district. (NRS 318.116) Existing law requires the secretary of the
4 board of a district to keep in a well-bound book a record of all of the board’s
5 proceedings, minutes of all meetings, any certificates, contracts, bonds given by
6 employees and all corporate acts. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 of this bill eliminates
7 the requirement to keep this information in a well-bound book but still requires the
8 secretary to keep such information. Section 1 requires the secretary to also keep a
9 record of budgets and any other information or records necessary for carrying out
10 the duties of the board.
11 Existing law requires the treasurer of the board to keep strict and accurate
12 accounts of all money received by and disbursed for and on behalf of the district in

13 permanent records. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 provides that this information
14 includes all audits and financial statements of the district.
15 Section 1 also provides that all records of the board’s actions, including,
16 without limitation, minutes, budgets, audits and financial statements, must be: (1)

20 Existing law further sets the maximum compensation of a member of a board of
21 a district to not more than: (1) $6,000 per year; or (2) $9,000 per year if the board
22 of a district has been granted certain powers relating to acquiring sanitary sewer
23 improvements, collection and disposal of garbage and refuse and supply, storage
24 and distribution of water for private and public purposes. (NRS 318.085) Section 1
25 increases the compensation each member of a board of a district granted such
26 powers may receive from not more than $9,000 per year to not more than $14,500
27 per year.
28 Existing law gives the board of a district created wholly or in part for acquiring
29 television maintenance facilities certain powers. (NRS 318.1192) Section 3 of this

37 purpose.
38 Existing law authorizes certain special districts, including general improvement
39 districts, with annual total expenditures of less than $300,000 to petition the
40 Department of Taxation for exemption from the requirements of the Local
41 Government Budget and Finance Act (NRS 354.470-354.626) for the filing of
42 certain budget documents and audit reports. Existing law further provides that if an
43 exemption is granted by the Department, the special district is exempt from all
44 publication requirements of the Local Government Budget and Finance Act, except
45 that the Department of Taxation by regulation shall require an annual publication of
46 a notice of budget adoption and filing. (NRS 354.475) Section 4 of this bill
47 provides that if a petition filed by a general improvement district is granted by the
48 Department, the board of the general improvement district is exempt from all
49 publication requirements of the Local Government Budget and Finance Act but is
50 required publish the district’s budget, financial statements and audits that are
51 required by section 1.
52 Existing law authorizes the Housing Division of the Department of Business
53 and Industry to issue transferable tax credits, which are authorized to be taken
54 against certain state taxes, to the sponsor of a project for the acquisition,
55 development, construction, improvement, expansion, reconstruction or
56 rehabilitation of a qualified low-income housing project, as defined by existing
57 federal law. (NRS 360.860-360.870; 26 U.S.C. § 42(g)) Under existing law, to be
58 issued transferable tax credits, the project sponsor is required to: (1) apply to, and
59 obtain from, the Division a reservation of an amount of transferable tax credits; (2)

61 tax credits by acquiring title to the project site, entering into an agreement with a
62 licensed contractor to construct the project and obtaining certain financing for the
63 project; and (3) submit to the Division a final application for the issuance of
64 transferable tax credits not less than 45 days before the project closes. A project
65 sponsor that is issued transferable tax credits is authorized to transfer the credits to
66 another entity, which may transfer those transferable tax credits to one or more of
67 its subsidiaries or affiliates. (NRS 360.867)
