CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to community development; requiring certain
records to be maintained by the board of trustees of certain
general improvement districts; increasing the compensation
of the board of trustees of certain general improvement
districts; requiring a general improvement district created for
acquiring television maintenance facilities to report certain
information annually to the board of county commissioners
of the county in which the district is located; exempting
certain general improvement districts from an annual
publication of certain notices of budget adoption and filing;
revising provisions governing the procedure for applying for
transferable tax credits for affordable housing and the transfer
of such tax credits; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the creation of a general
improvement district to provide certain governmental services and facilities to the
residents of the district. (NRS 318.116) Existing law requires the secretary of the
board of a district to keep in a well-bound book a record of all of the board’s
proceedings, minutes of all meetings, any certificates, contracts, bonds given by
employees and all corporate acts. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 of this bill eliminates
the requirement to keep this information in a well-bound book but still requires the
secretary to keep such information. Section 1 requires the secretary to also keep a
record of budgets and any other information or records necessary for carrying out
the duties of the board.
Existing law requires the treasurer of the board to keep strict and accurate
accounts of all money received by and disbursed for and on behalf of the district in
permanent records. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 provides that this information
includes all audits and financial statements of the district.

Section 2:
Section 1 also provides that all records of the board’s actions, including,
without limitation, minutes, budgets, audits and financial statements, must be: (1)
published on the Internet website maintained by the board; or (2) provided to the
county in which the district is located for publication on the Internet website of the
county.
Existing law further sets the maximum compensation of a member of a board of
a district to not more than: (1) $6,000 per year; or (2) $9,000 per year if the board
of a district has been granted certain powers relating to acquiring sanitary sewer
improvements, collection and disposal of garbage and refuse and supply, storage
and distribution of water for private and public purposes. (NRS 318.085) Section 1
increases the compensation each member of a board of a district granted such
powers may receive from not more than $9,000 per year to not more than $14,500
per year.
Existing law gives the board of a district created wholly or in part for acquiring
television maintenance facilities certain powers. (NRS 318.1192) Section 3 of this
bill requires the board of such a district to submit an annual report to the board of
-
83rd Session (2025)

county commissioners of the county in which the district is located that sets forth,
without limitation: (1) the budget and expenditures of the district; (2) the status of
the equipment of the district; (3) the status of any license held by the district; (4) a
recommendation as to whether the continuation of the district is necessary; and (5)
any information necessary for the board of county commissioners to review the
work of the board and determine whether the board is achieving its statutory
purpose.
Existing law authorizes certain special districts, including general improvement
districts, with annual total expenditures of less than $300,000 to petition the
Department of Taxation for exemption from the requirements of the Local
Government Budget and Finance Act (NRS 354.470-354.626) for the filing of
certain budget documents and audit reports. Existing law further provides that if an
exemption is granted by the Department, the special district is exempt from all
publication requirements of the Local Government Budget and Finance Act, except
that the Department of Taxation by regulation shall require an annual publication of
a notice of budget adoption and filing. (NRS 354.475) Section 4 of this bill
provides that if a petition filed by a general improvement district is granted by the
Department, the board of the general improvement district is exempt from all
publication requirements of the Local Government Budget and Finance Act but is
required publish the district’s budget, financial statements and audits that are
required by section 1.
Existing law authorizes the Housing Division of the Department of Business
and Industry to issue transferable tax credits, which are authorized to be taken
against certain state taxes, to the sponsor of a project for the acquisition,
development, construction, improvement, expansion, reconstruction or
rehabilitation of a qualified low-income housing project, as defined by existing
federal law. (NRS 360.860-360.870; 26 U.S.C. § 42(g)) Under existing law, to be
issued transferable tax credits, the project sponsor is required to: (1) apply to, and
obtain from, the Division a reservation of an amount of transferable tax credits; (2)
close the project within a certain period after obtaining a reservation of transferable
tax credits by acquiring title to the project site, entering into an agreement with a
licensed contractor to construct the project and obtaining certain financing for the
project; and (3) submit to the Division a final application for the issuance of
transferable tax credits not less than 45 days before the project closes. A project
sponsor that is issued transferable tax credits is authorized to transfer the credits to
another entity, which may transfer those transferable tax credits to one or more of
its subsidiaries or affiliates. (NRS 360.867)

Section 3:
Section 5 of this bill: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, a final application
for the issuance of transferable tax credits to be submitted not less than 15 days
before the closing of the project rather than not less than 45 days before the closing
of the project; (2) authorizes a project sponsor to demonstrate the acquisition of the
land to close the project by entering into a long-term ground lease for the project
site; and (3) authorizes a project sponsor to transfer transferable tax credits to a
member or partner of the project sponsor to any other entity, who may then transfer
the transferable tax credits to another entity.

Assembly Bill No. 301–Assemblymembers
Goulding; and La Rue Hatch
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to community development; requiring certain
records to be maintained by the board of trustees of certain
general improvement districts; increasing the compensation
of the board of trustees of certain general improvement
districts; requiring a general improvement district created for
acquiring television maintenance facilities to report certain
information annually to the board of county commissioners
of the county in which the district is located; exempting
certain general improvement districts from an annual
publication of certain notices of budget adoption and filing;
revising provisions governing the procedure for applying for
transferable tax credits for affordable housing and the transfer
of such tax credits; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the creation of a general
improvement district to provide certain governmental services and facilities to the
residents of the district. (NRS 318.116) Existing law requires the secretary of the
board of a district to keep in a well-bound book a record of all of the board’s
proceedings, minutes of all meetings, any certificates, contracts, bonds given by
employees and all corporate acts. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 of this bill eliminates
the requirement to keep this information in a well-bound book but still requires the
secretary to keep such information. Section 1 requires the secretary to also keep a
record of budgets and any other information or records necessary for carrying out
the duties of the board.
Existing law requires the treasurer of the board to keep strict and accurate
accounts of all money received by and disbursed for and on behalf of the district in
permanent records. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 provides that this information
includes all audits and financial statements of the district.
Section 1 also provides that all records of the board’s actions, including,
without limitation, minutes, budgets, audits and financial statements, must be: (1)
published on the Internet website maintained by the board; or (2) provided to the
county in which the district is located for publication on the Internet website of the
county.
Existing law further sets the maximum compensation of a member of a board of
a district to not more than: (1) $6,000 per year; or (2) $9,000 per year if the board
of a district has been granted certain powers relating to acquiring sanitary sewer
improvements, collection and disposal of garbage and refuse and supply, storage
and distribution of water for private and public purposes. (NRS 318.085) Section 1
increases the compensation each member of a board of a district granted such
powers may receive from not more than $9,000 per year to not more than $14,500
per year.
Existing law gives the board of a district created wholly or in part for acquiring
television maintenance facilities certain powers. (NRS 318.1192) Section 3 of this
bill requires the board of such a district to submit an annual report to the board of
-

– 2 –
county commissioners of the county in which the district is located that sets forth,
without limitation: (1) the budget and expenditures of the district; (2) the status of
the equipment of the district; (3) the status of any license held by the district; (4) a
recommendation as to whether the continuation of the district is necessary; and (5)
any information necessary for the board of county commissioners to review the
work of the board and determine whether the board is achieving its statutory
purpose.
Existing law authorizes certain special districts, including general improvement
districts, with annual total expenditures of less than $300,000 to petition the
Department of Taxation for exemption from the requirements of the Local
Government Budget and Finance Act (NRS 354.470-354.626) for the filing of
certain budget documents and audit reports. Existing law further provides that if an
exemption is granted by the Department, the special district is exempt from all
publication requirements of the Local Government Budget and Finance Act, except
that the Department of Taxation by regulation shall require an annual publication of
a notice of budget adoption and filing. (NRS 354.475) Section 4 of this bill
provides that if a petition filed by a general improvement district is granted by the
Department, the board of the general improvement district is exempt from all
publication requirements of the Local Government Budget and Finance Act but is
required publish the district’s budget, financial statements and audits that are
required by section 1.
Existing law authorizes the Housing Division of the Department of Business
and Industry to issue transferable tax credits, which are authorized to be taken
against certain state taxes, to the sponsor of a project for the acquisition,
development, construction, improvement, expansion, reconstruction or
rehabilitation of a qualified low-income housing project, as defined by existing
federal law. (NRS 360.860-360.870; 26 U.S.C. § 42(g)) Under existing law, to be
issued transferable tax credits, the project sponsor is required to: (1) apply to, and
obtain from, the Division a reservation of an amount of transferable tax credits; (2)
close the project within a certain period after obtaining a reservation of transferable
tax credits by acquiring title to the project site, entering into an agreement with a
licensed contractor to construct the project and obtaining certain financing for the
project; and (3) submit to the Division a final application for the issuance of
transferable tax credits not less than 45 days before the project closes. A project
sponsor that is issued transferable tax credits is authorized to transfer the credits to
another entity, which may transfer those transferable tax credits to one or more of
its subsidiaries or affiliates. (NRS 360.867)
Section 5 of this bill: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, a final application
for the issuance of transferable tax credits to be submitted not less than 15 days
before the closing of the project rather than not less than 45 days before the closing
of the project; (2) authorizes a project sponsor to demonstrate the acquisition of the
land to close the project by entering into a long-term ground lease for the project
site; and (3) authorizes a project sponsor to transfer transferable tax credits to a
member or partner of the project sponsor to any other entity, who may then transfer
the transferable tax credits to another entity.

3. The Division shall:
(a) Review each application for a certificate of eligibility for
transferable tax credits submitted pursuant to subsection 2 and any
supporting documents to determine whether the requirements for
eligibility for a reservation of transferable tax credits are met and the

(b) Determine the amount of transferable tax credits for which
the project may be eligible, which amount must equal the amount
determined by the Division to be necessary to make the project

the expiration of that period, the Division receives from the project
sponsor a written request for an extension of not more than 45 days.
The Division may grant only one extension pursuant to this

substantially completed;
(2) The delay in closing was the result of circumstances that
could not have been anticipated by and were outside the control of
the project sponsor at the time the application was submitted by the

eligible for transferable tax credits in the order of the amount of
transferable tax credit threshold points awarded to each such project
pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 3.
6. Except as otherwise provided in this section, to be issued
transferable tax credits:

notice of the reservation of transferable tax credits pursuant to
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
subsection 4, the project sponsor must demonstrate to the Division
that the project has been closed by providing proof satisfactory to
the Division that the project sponsor has:

project. The applicant must provide written commitments or
contracts from third parties.
(4) Executed a written commitment for a loan for permanent
financing for the construction of the project in an amount that
ensures the financial feasibility of the project. The commitment may
be subject to the condition that the construction is completed and the

accordance with the requirements of the lender for credit. If the
project is a rural development project that receives loans or grants
from the United States Department of Agriculture, the applicant
must provide a form approved by the Division that indicates that
money has been obligated for the construction of the project before
the expiration of the period. An advance of that money is not
required before the expiration of the period.

project sponsor must submit to the Division a final application for
transferable tax credits on a form provided by the Division and such
other information as the Division deems necessary to determine
whether the project qualifies for the issuance of transferable tax
credits. Upon receipt of a final application pursuant to this
paragraph, the Division shall complete a review of the project and
the project sponsor. If, after such review, the Division determines
that the project complies with the requirements upon which
transferable tax credits were reserved pursuant to this section and a
declaration of restrictive covenants and conditions will be recorded
in the office of the county recorder for the county in which the
project is located:
(1) The Division shall:
(I) Determine the appropriate amount of transferable tax
credits for the project, which must be the amount the Division
determines is necessary to make the project financially feasible after
all other sources of funding are allocated and paid toward the final
cost of the project and may not exceed the amount of transferable
tax credits reserved for the project pursuant to this section; and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 10 –
(II) Notify the project sponsor that the transferable tax
credits will be issued;
(2) Within 30 days after the receipt of the notice, the project
sponsor shall make an irrevocable declaration of the amount of
transferable tax credits that will be applied to each fee or tax set
forth in subsection 1, thereby accounting for all of the credits which
will be issued; and
(3) Upon receipt of the declaration described in subparagraph
(2), the Division shall issue transferable tax credits to the project
sponsor in the amount approved by the Division. The project
sponsor may transfer the transferable tax credits to a member or
partner of the project sponsor or to any other entity. The project
sponsor shall notify the Division upon transferring any transferable
tax credits. An entity to which a project sponsor transfers any
transferable tax credits may transfer those transferable tax credits to
one or more of its subsidiaries or affiliates and shall notify the
Division upon making any such transfer. The Division shall notify
the Department of Taxation, the Office of Finance, the Fiscal
Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the
Nevada Gaming Control Board of all transferable tax credits issued,
segregated by each fee or tax set forth in subsection 1, and of all
transferable tax credits transferred, segregated by each fee or tax set
forth in subsection 1.
7. Upon completion of the project, the project sponsor shall
submit to the Division a certification of costs on a form provided by
the Division and such other information as the Division deems
necessary to determine the final cost of the project. If, based upon
the final cost of the project indicated in the certification of costs, the
Division determines that the amount of transferable tax credits
issued by the Division to the project sponsor is greater than the
amount of transferable tax credits to which the project sponsor is
entitled:
(a) The Division shall notify the project sponsor, the Department
of Taxation, the Office of Finance, the Fiscal Analysis Division of
the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the Nevada Gaming Control
Board that the project sponsor is required to repay the portion of the
transferable tax credits to which the project sponsor is not entitled.
The notice must specify the amount of transferable tax credits that
the project sponsor is required to repay.
(b) The project sponsor shall repay to the Department of
Taxation or the Nevada Gaming Control Board, as applicable, the
portion of the transferable tax credits to which the project sponsor is
not entitled.

Administrator of the Division to protect from disclosure any
information in the application which, under generally accepted
business practices, would be considered a trade secret or other
confidential proprietary information of the business. After
consulting with the business, the Administrator of the Division shall
determine whether to protect the information from disclosure. The

subject to judicial review. If the Administrator of the Division
determines to protect the information from disclosure, the protected
information:
