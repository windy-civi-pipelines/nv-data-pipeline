AN ACT relating to general improvement districts; increasing the compensation of

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the creation of a general
2 improvement district to provide certain governmental services and facilities to the residents of
3 the district. (NRS 318.116) Existing law further sets the maximum compensation of a member
4 of a board of a district to not more than: (1) $6,000 per year; or (2) $9,000 per year if the
5 board of a district has been granted certain powers relating to acquiring sanitary sewer
6 improvements, collection and disposal of garbage and refuse and supply, storage and
7 distribution of water for private and public purposes. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 of this bill
8 increases the compensation each member of a board of a district granted such powers may
9 receive from not more than $9,000 per year to not more than $14,500 per year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

2 charge pursuant to NRS 241.035.
3 4. The treasurer shall keep strict and accurate accounts of all money received

5 treasurer shall file with the county clerk, at the expense of the district, a corporate
6 surety bond in an amount not more than $50,000, the form and exact amount
7 thereof to be approved and determined, respectively, by the board of county
8 commissioners, conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of his or her
9 office. Any other officer or trustee who actually receives or disburses money of the
10 district shall furnish a bond as provided in this subsection. The board of county
11 commissioners may, upon good cause shown, increase or decrease the amount of
12 that bond.
13 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, each member of a board of
14 trustees of a district organized or reorganized pursuant to this chapter may receive
15 as compensation for his or her service not more than $6,000 per year. Each member
16 of a board of trustees of a district that is organized or reorganized pursuant to this
17 chapter and which is granted the powers set forth in NRS 318.140, 318.142 and
18 318.144 may receive as compensation for his or her service not more than [$9,000]
19 $14,500 per year.
20 6. The compensation of the members of a board is payable monthly, if the
21 budget is adequate and a majority of the members of the board vote in favor of such
22 compensation, but no member of the board may receive any other compensation for
23 his or her service to the district as an employee or otherwise. Each member of the
24 board must receive the same amount of compensation. If a majority of the members
25 of the board vote in favor of an increase in the compensation of the trustees, the
26 increase may not become effective until January 1 of the calendar year immediately
27 following the next biennial election of the district as set forth in NRS 318.095.
