4 compensation of a member of a board of a district to not more than: (1) $6,000 per
5 year; or (2) $9,000 per year if the board of a district has been granted certain

7 of garbage and refuse and supply, storage and distribution of water for private and
8 public purposes. (NRS 318.085) Section 1 of this bill increases the compensation
