funding all the provisions negotiated in such collective bargaining agreements
may be limited by these economic realities; now therefore,

WHEREAS, The implementation of collective bargaining for certain state
employees provides an efficient mechanism for those employees to have a voice
in the terms and conditions of their employment; and
WHEREAS, The Legislature, although recognizing the tremendous service
of those state employees, has a responsibility to ensure the financial solvency of
this State; and
WHEREAS, Economic conditions in this State can change rapidly based on
many factors often outside the control of the Legislature and, as a result,
funding all the provisions negotiated in such collective bargaining agreements
may be limited by these economic realities; now therefore,
