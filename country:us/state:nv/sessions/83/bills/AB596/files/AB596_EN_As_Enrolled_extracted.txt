Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public employees; making appropriations and
authorizations for the payment of quarterly retention
incentives, the implementation of certain provisions of certain
collective bargaining agreements and the payment of salary
increases for certain public employees; providing that certain
provisions of collective bargaining agreements to which the
State is a party are void; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
WHEREAS, The implementation of collective bargaining for
certain state employees provides an efficient mechanism for those
employees to have a voice in the terms and conditions of their
employment; and
WHEREAS, The Legislature, although recognizing the
tremendous service of those state employees, has a responsibility to
ensure the financial solvency of this State; and
WHEREAS, Economic conditions in this State can change rapidly
based on many factors often outside the control of the Legislature
and, as a result, funding all the provisions negotiated in such
collective bargaining agreements may be limited by these economic
realities; now therefore,

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 596–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public employees; making appropriations and
authorizations for the payment of quarterly retention
incentives, the implementation of certain provisions of certain
collective bargaining agreements and the payment of salary
increases for certain public employees; providing that certain
provisions of collective bargaining agreements to which the
State is a party are void; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
WHEREAS, The implementation of collective bargaining for
certain state employees provides an efficient mechanism for those
employees to have a voice in the terms and conditions of their
employment; and
WHEREAS, The Legislature, although recognizing the
tremendous service of those state employees, has a responsibility to
ensure the financial solvency of this State; and
WHEREAS, Economic conditions in this State can change rapidly
based on many factors often outside the control of the Legislature
and, as a result, funding all the provisions negotiated in such
collective bargaining agreements may be limited by these economic
realities; now therefore,
