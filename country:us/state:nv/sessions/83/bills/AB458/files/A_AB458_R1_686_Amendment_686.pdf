concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
electricity on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to customer-
2 generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773) Existing law defines “net
3 metering” to mean measuring the difference between the electricity supplied by a utility and
4 the electricity generated by certain customers which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769)
5 Sections 13 and 14 of this bill authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing
6 system to participate in net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to
7 solar-powered affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own
8 or operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public utility.”
9 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions set forth in sections
10 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net metering.
11 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net metering to
12 provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-powered affordable

Senate Amendment No. 686 to Assembly Bill No. 458 First Reprint Page 4
13 housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity produced or consumed and the
14 awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by a solar-powered affordable housing
15 system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish certain requirements for any tariff or contract
16 which relates to a solar-powered affordable housing system. Section 9.3 of this bill requires
17 an application to qualify for the tariff submitted to the utility by an owner or operator of a
18 solar-powered affordable housing system to include certain supporting documentation which
19 shows that the system is part of a qualified multifamily affordable housing property. Section
20 9.7 of this bill requires the owner of a solar-powered affordable housing system, in the initial
21 application for the tariff which the owner submits to the utility, to inform the utility of the
22 proper allocation of capacity and its associated production to customer-generators of the
23 system. Section 18 of this bill provides that, with certain exceptions, certain provisions
24 governing the rates charged for the provision of electric service by the landlord of a
25 manufactured home park or mobile home park or owner of a company town do not apply to
26 the owner or operator of a solar-powered affordable housing system.
27 Section 10.3 of this bill requires the owner or landlord of a qualified multifamily
28 affordable housing property to notify residents and new tenants of certain information relating
29 to a solar-powered affordable housing system that is on the premises or to be installed on the
30 premises.
31 Section 10.7 of this bill provides that certain provisions governing public works apply to
32 any contract for construction work related to a solar-powered affordable housing system
33 financed in whole or in part by a state or local government, even if the construction work does
34 not qualify as a public work.
35 Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an expanded solar
36 access program to residential customers and to certain nonresidential customers who consume
37 less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission
38 of Nevada to adopt certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access
39 program; and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
40 solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to participate in an
41 expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential customers; (2) certain
42 disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and (3) certain residential customers
43 who cannot install solar resources on the premises of the customer. In implementing the
44 expanded solar access program, an electric utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a
45 certain number of community-based solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income
46 residential customers with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)
47 Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-income
48 residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access program; and (2)
49 requires customers who are supported with certain funding from the Nevada Clean Energy
50 Fund to comply with certain requirements. Section 17 also authorizes such a participating
51 customer to remain continuously enrolled in the program without having to reapply. For
52 community-based solar resources, section 17: (1) increases the maximum nameplate capacity
53 from not more than 1 megawatt to not more than 5 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open
54 bidding or requests for proposals for the selection of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the
55 selection of sites that provide resiliency for the electric grid and benefits for the community;
56 and (4) requires construction of additional community-based solar resources in proportion to
57 increased participation in the expanded solar access program.
58 Existing law: (1) imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell
59 and install distributed generation systems in this State; (2) prescribes certain contractual
60 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
61 a power purchase agreement; and (3) provides that the violation of those provisions relating to
62 distributed generation systems constitutes a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.9801-
63 598.9822) Sections 1 and 19-25 of this bill make these provisions applicable to solar-powered
64 affordable housing systems.
65 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from performing any work on, or providing a bid for
66 or executing a contract to perform such work on, a residential photovoltaic system used to
67 produce electricity on a single-family residence unless the person holds a license issued by the
68 State Contractors’ Board or is an employee of such a person; (2) imposes certain requirements
69 on contractors who perform work on such systems; (3) establishes requirements for contracts
70 for such work; (4) prohibits or limits certain practices related to such work and contracts; and
71 (5) authorizes certain penalties and disciplinary action for violations of these provisions. (NRS

Senate Amendment No. 686 to Assembly Bill No. 458 First Reprint Page 5
72 624.830-624.895) Sections 23, 26 and 29-35 of this bill make these provisions applicable to a
73 residential photovoltaic system, including a solar-powered affordable housing system, located
74 on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property.
75 Section 28 of this bill requires a general building contractor, in the case of a contract for
76 work concerning a residential photovoltaic system to produce electricity on a qualified
77 multifamily affordable housing property, to provide to the owner of the property certain
78 information relating to subcontractors on the project, certain persons who furnished material
79 for the project and liens.
80 Existing law authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to require a contractor who performs
81 work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce electricity to obtain
82 performance and payment bonds if the contractor: (1) is determined by the Board to have
83 committed certain violations; (2) enters into a contract that is later found to be void and
84 unenforceable against an owner; or (3) has five valid complaints filed against him or her with
85 the Board within a 15-day period. (NRS 624.270) Sections 23 and 28 make this provision
86 applicable to a contractor who performs work on a solar-powered affordable housing system
87 located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property.

12 allocated share of the solar-powered affordable housing system’s production and
13 deduct the allocated total kilowatt-hour output from each user’s total measured
14 consumption.
15 (b) If the electricity supplied by the utility exceeds the electricity generated by
16 the customer-generator , or the customer-generator’s allocated share of the
17 electricity generated by a solar-powered affordable housing system, which is fed
18 back to the utility during the billing period, the customer-generator must be billed
19 for the net electricity supplied by the utility.
20 (c) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.7732, if the electricity generated
21 by the customer-generator , or the customer-generator’s allocated share of the

24 period:
25 (1) Neither the utility nor the customer-generator is entitled to
26 compensation for the electricity provided to the other during the billing period.
27 (2) The excess electricity which is fed back to the utility during the billing
28 period is carried forward to the next billing period as an addition to the kilowatt-
29 hours generated by the customer-generator in that billing period. If the customer-
30 generator is billed for electricity pursuant to a time-of-use rate schedule, the excess
31 electricity carried forward must be added to the same time-of-use period as the
32 time-of-use period in which it was generated unless the subsequent billing period
33 lacks a corresponding time-of-use period. In that case, the excess electricity carried
34 forward must be apportioned evenly among the available time-of-use periods.
35 (3) Excess electricity may be carried forward to subsequent billing periods
36 indefinitely, but a customer-generator is not entitled to receive compensation for
37 any excess electricity that remains if:
38 (I) The net metering system ceases to operate or is disconnected from
39 the utility’s transmission and distribution facilities;
40 (II) The customer-generator ceases to be a customer of the utility at the
41 premises served by the net metering system; or
