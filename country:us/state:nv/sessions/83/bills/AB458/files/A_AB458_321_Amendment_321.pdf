matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to customer-
2 generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773) Existing law defines “net
3 metering” to mean measuring the difference between the electricity supplied by a utility and
4 the electricity generated by certain customers which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769)
5 Sections 13 and 14 of this bill authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing
6 system to participate in net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to
7 solar-powered affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own
8 or operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public utility.”
9 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions set forth in sections
10 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net metering.

Assembly Amendment No. 321 to Assembly Bill No. 458 Page 4
11 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net metering to
12 provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-powered affordable
13 housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity produced or consumed and the
14 awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by a solar-powered affordable housing
15 system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish certain requirements for any tariff or contract
16 which relates to a solar-powered affordable housing system. Section 9.3 of this bill requires
17 an application to qualify for the tariff submitted to the utility by an owner or operator of
18 a solar-powered affordable housing system to include certain supporting documentation
19 which shows that the system is part of a qualified multifamily affordable housing
20 property. Section 9.7 of this bill requires the owner of a solar-powered affordable
21 housing system, in the initial application for the tariff which the owner submits to the
22 utility, to inform the utility of the proper allocation of capacity and its associated
23 production to customer-generators of the system. Section 18 of this bill provides that, with
24 certain exceptions, certain provisions governing the rates charged for the provision of electric
25 service by the landlord of a manufactured home park or mobile home park or owner of a
26 company town do not apply to the owner or operator of a solar-powered affordable housing
27 system.
28 Section 10.3 of this bill requires the owner or landlord of a qualified multifamily
29 affordable housing property to notify residents and new tenants of certain information
30 relating to a solar-powered affordable housing system that is on the premises or to be
31 installed on the premises.
32 Section 10.7 of this bill provides that certain provisions governing public works
33 apply to any contract for construction work related to a solar-powered affordable
34 housing system financed in whole or in part by a state or local government, even if the
35 construction work does not qualify as a public work.
36 Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an expanded solar
37 access program to residential customers and to certain nonresidential customers who consume
38 less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission
39 of Nevada to adopt certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access
40 program; and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
41 solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to participate in an
42 expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential customers; (2) certain
43 disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and (3) certain residential customers
44 who cannot install solar resources on the premises of the customer. In implementing the
45 expanded solar access program, an electric utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a
46 certain number of community-based solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income
47 residential customers with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)
48 Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-income
49 residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access program; and (2)
50 [adds certain rate reductions for such] requires customers who are supported with certain
51 funding from the Nevada Clean Energy Fund [.] to comply with certain requirements.
52 Section 17 also authorizes such a participating customer to remain continuously enrolled in
53 the program without having to reapply. For community-based solar resources, section 17: (1)
54 increases the maximum nameplate capacity from not more than 1 megawatt to not more than 5
55 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open bidding or requests for proposals for the selection
56 of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the selection of sites that provide resiliency for the electric
57 grid and benefits for the community; and (4) requires construction of additional community-
58 based solar resources in proportion to increased participation in the expanded solar access
59 program.
60 Existing law: (1) imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
61 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State; (2) prescribes certain
62 contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed
63 generation system and a power purchase agreement; and (3) provides that the violation
64 of those provisions relating to distributed generation systems constitutes a deceptive
65 trade practice. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 1 and 19-25 of this bill make these
66 provisions applicable to solar-powered affordable housing systems.
67 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from performing any work on, or providing a
68 bid for or executing a contract to perform such work on, a residential photovoltaic
69 system used to produce electricity on a single-family residence unless the person holds a

Assembly Amendment No. 321 to Assembly Bill No. 458 Page 5
70 license issued by the State Contractors’ Board or is an employee of such a person; (2)
71 imposes certain requirements on contractors who perform work on such systems; (3)
72 establishes requirements for contracts for such work; (4) prohibits or limits certain
73 practices related to such work and contracts; and (5) authorizes certain penalties and
74 disciplinary action for violations of these provisions. (NRS 624.830-624.895) Sections 23,
75 26 and 29-35 of this bill make these provisions applicable to a residential photovoltaic
76 system, including a solar-powered affordable housing system, located on a qualified
77 multifamily affordable housing property.
78 Section 28 of this bill requires a general building contractor, in the case of a contract
79 for work concerning a residential photovoltaic system to produce electricity on a
80 qualified multifamily affordable housing property, to provide to the owner of the
81 property certain information relating to subcontractors on the project, certain persons
82 who furnished material for the project and liens.
83 Existing law authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to require a contractor who
84 performs work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce electricity
85 to obtain performance and payment bonds if the contractor: (1) is determined by the
86 Board to have committed certain violations; (2) enters into a contract that is later found
87 to be void and unenforceable against an owner; or (3) has five valid complaints filed
88 against him or her with the Board within a 15-day period. (NRS 624.270) Sections 23
89 and 28 of this bill make this provision applicable to a contractor who performs work on
90 a solar-powered affordable housing system located on a qualified multifamily affordable
91 housing property.

28 other conditions, stipulations or provisions as to which the parties may agree.
29 3. The provisions of [paragraph] paragraphs (k) , (l) and (m) of subsection 2
30 do not apply if:

32 full performance and completion of the contract and the cost of the bond is included
33 in the price of the project;
34 (b) The contractor builds a residential photovoltaic system used to produce

39 affordable housing property, as applicable, has:
40 (1) Purchased the residential photovoltaic system used to produce
41 electricity pursuant to a power purchase agreement as defined in NRS 598.9807; or
42 (2) Leased the residential photovoltaic system used to produce electricity
43 pursuant to a monthly lease contract.
44 4. The contract must contain:
45 (a) A method whereby the owner of the single-family residence or qualified

47 the contract, thereby indicating that those provisions have been read and are
48 understood.
49 (b) In close proximity to the signatures of the owner of the single-family
50 residence or qualified multifamily affordable housing property, as applicable, and
51 the contractor, a notice stating that the owner of the single-family residence [:] or
52 qualified multifamily affordable housing property, as applicable:

Assembly Amendment No. 321 to Assembly Bill No. 458 Page 29

23 waive any right provided by this chapter or any regulations adopted pursuant
24 thereto or relieves a person of an obligation or liability imposed by this chapter or
25 those regulations is void. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section
26 renders a contract voidable by the owner of the single-family residence [.] or
27 qualified multifamily affordable housing property, as applicable.
28 7. The contractor shall apply for and obtain all necessary permits and
29 approvals from an electric utility into whose system the residential photovoltaic
