Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to
2 customer-generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773)
3 Existing law defines “net metering” to mean measuring the difference between the
4 electricity supplied by a utility and the electricity generated by certain customers
5 which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769) Sections 13 and 14 of this bill
6 authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing system to participate in
7 net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to solar-powered
8 affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own or
9 operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public
10 utility.” Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions
11 set forth in sections 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net
12 metering.
13 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net
14 metering to provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-
15 powered affordable housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity
16 produced or consumed and the awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by
17 a solar-powered affordable housing system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish
18 certain requirements for any tariff or contract which relates to a solar-powered
19 affordable housing system. Section 9.3 of this bill requires an application to qualify
20 for the tariff submitted to the utility by an owner or operator of a solar-powered
21 affordable housing system to include certain supporting documentation which
22 shows that the system is part of a qualified multifamily affordable housing
23 property. Section 9.7 of this bill requires the owner of a solar-powered affordable
24 housing system, in the initial application for the tariff which the owner submits to
25 the utility, to inform the utility of the proper allocation of capacity and its
26 associated production to customer-generators of the system. Section 18 of this bill
27 provides that, with certain exceptions, certain provisions governing the rates
28 charged for the provision of electric service by the landlord of a manufactured
29 home park or mobile home park or owner of a company town do not apply to the
30 owner or operator of a solar-powered affordable housing system.
31 Section 10.3 of this bill requires the owner or landlord of a qualified
32 multifamily affordable housing property to notify residents and new tenants of
33 certain information relating to a solar-powered affordable housing system that is on
34 the premises or to be installed on the premises.
35 Section 10.7 of this bill provides that certain provisions governing public
36 works apply to any contract for construction work related to a solar-powered
37 affordable housing system financed in whole or in part by a state or local
38 government, even if the construction work does not qualify as a public work.
39 Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an
40 expanded solar access program to residential customers and to certain
41 nonresidential customers who consume less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of
42 electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
43 certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access program;
44 and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
45 solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to
46 participate in an expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential
47 customers; (2) certain disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and
48 (3) certain residential customers who cannot install solar resources on the premises
49 of the customer. In implementing the expanded solar access program, an electric
50 utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a certain number of community-based
51 solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income residential customers
52 with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)
53 Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-
54 income residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access
-
*AB458_R2*

55 program; and (2) requires customers who are supported with certain funding from
56 the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to comply with certain requirements. Section 17
57 also authorizes such a participating customer to remain continuously enrolled in the
58 program without having to reapply. For community-based solar resources, section
59 17: (1) increases the maximum nameplate capacity from not more than 1 megawatt
60 to not more than 5 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open bidding or requests
61 for proposals for the selection of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the selection of sites
62 that provide resiliency for the electric grid and benefits for the community; and (4)
63 requires construction of additional community-based solar resources in proportion
64 to increased participation in the expanded solar access program.
65 Existing law: (1) imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies
66 that sell and install distributed generation systems in this State; (2) prescribes
67 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
68 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement; and (3) provides
69 that the violation of those provisions relating to distributed generation systems
70 constitutes a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 1 and
71 19-25 of this bill make these provisions applicable to solar-powered affordable
72 housing systems.
73 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from performing any work on, or providing
74 a bid for or executing a contract to perform such work on, a residential photovoltaic
75 system used to produce electricity on a single-family residence unless the person
76 holds a license issued by the State Contractors’ Board or is an employee of such a
77 person; (2) imposes certain requirements on contractors who perform work on such
78 systems; (3) establishes requirements for contracts for such work; (4) prohibits or
79 limits certain practices related to such work and contracts; and (5) authorizes
80 certain penalties and disciplinary action for violations of these provisions. (NRS
81 624.830-624.895) Sections 23, 26 and 29-35 of this bill make these provisions
82 applicable to a residential photovoltaic system, including a solar-powered
83 affordable housing system, located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing
84 property.
85 Section 28 of this bill requires a general building contractor, in the case of a
86 contract for work concerning a residential photovoltaic system to produce
87 electricity on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property, to provide to the
88 owner of the property certain information relating to subcontractors on the project,
89 certain persons who furnished material for the project and liens.
90 Existing law authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to require a contractor
91 who performs work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
92 electricity to obtain performance and payment bonds if the contractor: (1) is
93 determined by the Board to have committed certain violations; (2) enters into a
94 contract that is later found to be void and unenforceable against an owner; or (3)
95 has five valid complaints filed against him or her with the Board within a 15-day
96 period. (NRS 624.270) Sections 23 and 28 make this provision applicable to a
97 contractor who performs work on a solar-powered affordable housing system
98 located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to
2 customer-generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773)
3 Existing law defines “net metering” to mean measuring the difference between the
4 electricity supplied by a utility and the electricity generated by certain customers
5 which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769) Sections 13 and 14 of this bill
6 authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing system to participate in
7 net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to solar-powered
8 affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own or
9 operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public
10 utility.” Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions
11 set forth in sections 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net
12 metering.
13 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net
14 metering to provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-
15 powered affordable housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity
16 produced or consumed and the awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by
17 a solar-powered affordable housing system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish
18 certain requirements for any tariff or contract which relates to a solar-powered
19 affordable housing system. Section 9.3 of this bill requires an application to qualify
20 for the tariff submitted to the utility by an owner or operator of a solar-powered
21 affordable housing system to include certain supporting documentation which
22 shows that the system is part of a qualified multifamily affordable housing
23 property. Section 9.7 of this bill requires the owner of a solar-powered affordable
24 housing system, in the initial application for the tariff which the owner submits to
25 the utility, to inform the utility of the proper allocation of capacity and its
26 associated production to customer-generators of the system. Section 18 of this bill
27 provides that, with certain exceptions, certain provisions governing the rates
28 charged for the provision of electric service by the landlord of a manufactured
29 home park or mobile home park or owner of a company town do not apply to the
30 owner or operator of a solar-powered affordable housing system.
31 Section 10.3 of this bill requires the owner or landlord of a qualified
32 multifamily affordable housing property to notify residents and new tenants of
33 certain information relating to a solar-powered affordable housing system that is on
34 the premises or to be installed on the premises.
35 Section 10.7 of this bill provides that certain provisions governing public
36 works apply to any contract for construction work related to a solar-powered
37 affordable housing system financed in whole or in part by a state or local
38 government, even if the construction work does not qualify as a public work.
39 Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an
40 expanded solar access program to residential customers and to certain
41 nonresidential customers who consume less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of
42 electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
43 certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access program;
44 and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
45 solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to
46 participate in an expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential
47 customers; (2) certain disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and
48 (3) certain residential customers who cannot install solar resources on the premises
49 of the customer. In implementing the expanded solar access program, an electric
50 utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a certain number of community-based
51 solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income residential customers
52 with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)
53 Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-
54 income residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access
-
*AB458_R2*

– 3 –
55 program; and (2) requires customers who are supported with certain funding from
56 the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to comply with certain requirements. Section 17
57 also authorizes such a participating customer to remain continuously enrolled in the
58 program without having to reapply. For community-based solar resources, section
59 17: (1) increases the maximum nameplate capacity from not more than 1 megawatt
60 to not more than 5 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open bidding or requests
61 for proposals for the selection of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the selection of sites
62 that provide resiliency for the electric grid and benefits for the community; and (4)
63 requires construction of additional community-based solar resources in proportion
64 to increased participation in the expanded solar access program.
65 Existing law: (1) imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies
66 that sell and install distributed generation systems in this State; (2) prescribes
67 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
68 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement; and (3) provides
69 that the violation of those provisions relating to distributed generation systems
70 constitutes a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 1 and
71 19-25 of this bill make these provisions applicable to solar-powered affordable
72 housing systems.
73 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from performing any work on, or providing
74 a bid for or executing a contract to perform such work on, a residential photovoltaic
75 system used to produce electricity on a single-family residence unless the person
76 holds a license issued by the State Contractors’ Board or is an employee of such a
77 person; (2) imposes certain requirements on contractors who perform work on such
78 systems; (3) establishes requirements for contracts for such work; (4) prohibits or
79 limits certain practices related to such work and contracts; and (5) authorizes
80 certain penalties and disciplinary action for violations of these provisions. (NRS
81 624.830-624.895) Sections 23, 26 and 29-35 of this bill make these provisions
82 applicable to a residential photovoltaic system, including a solar-powered
83 affordable housing system, located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing
84 property.
85 Section 28 of this bill requires a general building contractor, in the case of a
86 contract for work concerning a residential photovoltaic system to produce
87 electricity on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property, to provide to the
88 owner of the property certain information relating to subcontractors on the project,
89 certain persons who furnished material for the project and liens.
90 Existing law authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to require a contractor
91 who performs work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
92 electricity to obtain performance and payment bonds if the contractor: (1) is
93 determined by the Board to have committed certain violations; (2) enters into a
94 contract that is later found to be void and unenforceable against an owner; or (3)
95 has five valid complaints filed against him or her with the Board within a 15-day
96 period. (NRS 624.270) Sections 23 and 28 make this provision applicable to a
97 contractor who performs work on a solar-powered affordable housing system
98 located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

25 reduce any other fee or charge imposed by the utility.
26 3. If the cost of purchasing and installing a net metering system
27 was paid for:
28 (a) In whole or in part by a utility, the electricity generated by
29 the net metering system shall be deemed to be electricity that the
30 utility generated or acquired from a renewable energy system for the
31 purposes of complying with its portfolio standard pursuant to NRS
32 704.7801 to 704.7828, inclusive.
33 (b) Entirely by a customer-generator, including, without
34 limitation, a customer-generator that is the owner of a solar-
35 powered affordable housing system, the Commission shall issue to
36 the customer-generator portfolio energy credits for use within the
37 system of portfolio energy credits adopted by the Commission
38 pursuant to NRS 704.7821 and 704.78213 equal to the electricity
39 generated by the net metering system.
40 4. A bill for electrical service is due at the time established
41 pursuant to the terms of the contract between the utility and the
42 customer-generator.
