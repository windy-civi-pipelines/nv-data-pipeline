Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to
customer-generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773)
Existing law defines “net metering” to mean measuring the difference between the
electricity supplied by a utility and the electricity generated by certain customers
which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769) Sections 13 and 14 of this bill
authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing system to participate in
net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to solar-powered
affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own or
operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public
utility.” Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions
set forth in sections 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net
metering.

Section 2:
Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net
metering to provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-
powered affordable housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity
produced or consumed and the awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by
a solar-powered affordable housing system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish
certain requirements for any tariff or contract which relates to a solar-powered
affordable housing system. Section 9.3 of this bill requires an application to qualify
for the tariff submitted to the utility by an owner or operator of a solar-powered

affordable housing system to include certain supporting documentation which
shows that the system is part of a qualified multifamily affordable housing
property. Section 9.7 of this bill requires the owner of a solar-powered affordable
housing system, in the initial application for the tariff which the owner submits to
the utility, to inform the utility of the proper allocation of capacity and its
associated production to customer-generators of the system. Section 18 of this bill
provides that, with certain exceptions, certain provisions governing the rates
charged for the provision of electric service by the landlord of a manufactured
home park or mobile home park or owner of a company town do not apply to the
owner or operator of a solar-powered affordable housing system.

Section 3:
Section 10.3 of this bill requires the owner or landlord of a qualified
multifamily affordable housing property to notify residents and new tenants of
certain information relating to a solar-powered affordable housing system that is on
the premises or to be installed on the premises.

Section 4:
Section 10.7 of this bill provides that certain provisions governing public
works apply to any contract for construction work related to a solar-powered
affordable housing system financed in whole or in part by a state or local
government, even if the construction work does not qualify as a public work.
Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an
expanded solar access program to residential customers and to certain
nonresidential customers who consume less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of
electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access program;
and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to
participate in an expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential
customers; (2) certain disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and
(3) certain residential customers who cannot install solar resources on the premises
of the customer. In implementing the expanded solar access program, an electric
utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a certain number of community-based
solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income residential customers
with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)

Section 5:
Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-
income residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access
program; and (2) requires customers who are supported with certain funding from
the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to comply with certain requirements. Section 17
also authorizes such a participating customer to remain continuously enrolled in the
program without having to reapply. For community-based solar resources, section
17: (1) increases the maximum nameplate capacity from not more than 1 megawatt
to not more than 5 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open bidding or requests
for proposals for the selection of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the selection of sites
that provide resiliency for the electric grid and benefits for the community; and (4)
requires construction of additional community-based solar resources in proportion
to increased participation in the expanded solar access program.
Existing law: (1) imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies
that sell and install distributed generation systems in this State; (2) prescribes
certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement; and (3) provides
that the violation of those provisions relating to distributed generation systems
constitutes a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 1 and
19-25 of this bill make these provisions applicable to solar-powered affordable
housing systems.

Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from performing any work on, or providing
a bid for or executing a contract to perform such work on, a residential photovoltaic
system used to produce electricity on a single-family residence unless the person
holds a license issued by the State Contractors’ Board or is an employee of such a
person; (2) imposes certain requirements on contractors who perform work on such
systems; (3) establishes requirements for contracts for such work; (4) prohibits or
limits certain practices related to such work and contracts; and (5) authorizes
certain penalties and disciplinary action for violations of these provisions. (NRS

Section 6:
624.830-624.895) Sections 23, 26 and 29-35 of this bill make these provisions
applicable to a residential photovoltaic system, including a solar-powered
affordable housing system, located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing
property.

Section 7:
Section 28 of this bill requires a general building contractor, in the case of a
contract for work concerning a residential photovoltaic system to produce
electricity on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property, to provide to the
owner of the property certain information relating to subcontractors on the project,
certain persons who furnished material for the project and liens.
Existing law authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to require a contractor
who performs work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
electricity to obtain performance and payment bonds if the contractor: (1) is
determined by the Board to have committed certain violations; (2) enters into a
contract that is later found to be void and unenforceable against an owner; or (3)
has five valid complaints filed against him or her with the Board within a 15-day
period. (NRS 624.270) Sections 23 and 28 make this provision applicable to a
contractor who performs work on a solar-powered affordable housing system
located on a qualified multifamily affordable housing property.

Assembly Bill No. 458–Assemblymember Watts
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to energy; authorizing the users of a solar-
powered affordable housing system to participate in net
metering; exempting the owner or operator of a solar-
powered affordable housing system from certain provisions
of law; requiring the owner or landlord of a qualified
multifamily affordable housing property to notify residents
and new tenants of certain information relating to a solar-
powered affordable housing system; making certain
provisions governing public works applicable to contracts for
construction work related to certain solar-powered affordable
housing systems; establishing requirements for a tariff or
contract relating to a solar-powered affordable housing
system; revising provisions governing the administration of
net metering; revising provisions relating to an expanded
solar access program which certain electric utilities are
required to offer; revising certain contractual requirements
for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a solar-powered
affordable housing system; imposing various requirements
and restrictions on a contractor who performs work
concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
electricity on a qualified multifamily affordable housing
property; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to
customer-generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773)
Existing law defines “net metering” to mean measuring the difference between the
electricity supplied by a utility and the electricity generated by certain customers
which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769) Sections 13 and 14 of this bill
authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing system to participate in
net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to solar-powered
affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own or
operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public
utility.” Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions
set forth in sections 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net
metering.
Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net
metering to provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-
powered affordable housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity
produced or consumed and the awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by
a solar-powered affordable housing system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish
certain requirements for any tariff or contract which relates to a solar-powered
affordable housing system. Section 9.3 of this bill requires an application to qualify
for the tariff submitted to the utility by an owner or operator of a solar-powered

affordable housing system to include certain supporting documentation which
shows that the system is part of a qualified multifamily affordable housing
property. Section 9.7 of this bill requires the owner of a solar-powered affordable
housing system, in the initial application for the tariff which the owner submits to
the utility, to inform the utility of the proper allocation of capacity and its
associated production to customer-generators of the system. Section 18 of this bill

Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an
expanded solar access program to residential customers and to certain
nonresidential customers who consume less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of
electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access program;
and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to
participate in an expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential
customers; (2) certain disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and
(3) certain residential customers who cannot install solar resources on the premises
of the customer. In implementing the expanded solar access program, an electric
utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a certain number of community-based
solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income residential customers
with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)
Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-
income residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access
program; and (2) requires customers who are supported with certain funding from
the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to comply with certain requirements. Section 17
also authorizes such a participating customer to remain continuously enrolled in the
program without having to reapply. For community-based solar resources, section
17: (1) increases the maximum nameplate capacity from not more than 1 megawatt
to not more than 5 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open bidding or requests
for proposals for the selection of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the selection of sites
that provide resiliency for the electric grid and benefits for the community; and (4)
requires construction of additional community-based solar resources in proportion
to increased participation in the expanded solar access program.
Existing law: (1) imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies
that sell and install distributed generation systems in this State; (2) prescribes
certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement; and (3) provides
that the violation of those provisions relating to distributed generation systems
constitutes a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 1 and
19-25 of this bill make these provisions applicable to solar-powered affordable
housing systems.
