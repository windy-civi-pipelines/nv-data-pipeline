EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to energy; authorizing the users of a solar-
powered affordable housing system to participate in net
metering; exempting the owner or operator of a solar-
powered affordable housing system from certain
provisions of law; establishing requirements for a tariff or
contract relating to a solar-powered affordable housing
system; revising provisions governing the administration
of net metering; revising provisions relating to an
expanded solar access program which certain electric
utilities are required to offer; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility in this State to offer net metering to
2 customer-generators operating in the service area of the utility. (NRS 704.773)
3 Existing law defines “net metering” to mean measuring the difference between the
4 electricity supplied by a utility and the electricity generated by certain customers
5 which is fed back to the utility. (NRS 704.769) Sections 13 and 14 of this bill
6 authorize the users of a solar-powered affordable housing system to participate in
7 net metering. Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms related to solar-powered
8 affordable housing systems. Section 11 of this bill excludes persons who own or
9 operate a solar-powered affordable housing system from the definition of “public
10 utility.” Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the definitions
11 set forth in sections 2-8 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing net
12 metering. Sections 15 and 16 of this bill revise existing provisions governing net
13 metering to provide for the administration of net metering with respect to solar-
14 powered affordable housing systems, including the measuring of net electricity
15 produced or consumed and the awarding of credit for excess electricity produced by
16 a solar-powered affordable housing system. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill establish
17 certain requirements for any tariff or contract which relates to a solar-powered
-

18 affordable housing system. Section 18 of this bill provides that, with certain
19 exceptions, certain provisions governing the rates charged for the provision of
20 electric service by the landlord of a manufactured home park or mobile home park
21 or owner of a company town do not apply to the owner or operator of a solar-
22 powered affordable housing system.
23 Existing law requires: (1) certain electric utilities in this State to offer an
24 expanded solar access program to residential customers and to certain
25 nonresidential customers who consume less than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of
26 electricity per month; (2) the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
27 certain regulations for the implementation of the expanded solar access program;
28 and (3) an electric utility to submit a plan for the implementation of the expanded
29 solar access program. Under existing law, the customers who are eligible to
30 participate in an expanded solar access program are: (1) low-income residential
31 customers; (2) certain disadvantaged businesses and nonprofit organizations; and
32 (3) certain residential customers who cannot install solar resources on the premises
33 of the customer. In implementing the expanded solar access program, an electric
34 utility is required to: (1) make use of at least a certain number of community-based
35 solar resources; and (2) provide participating low-income residential customers
36 with a lower rate. (NRS 704.7865)
37 Section 17 of this bill: (1) revises the criteria for eligibility so that only low-
38 income residential customers are eligible to participate in an expanded solar access
39 program; and (2) adds certain rate reductions for such customers who are supported
40 with certain funding from the Nevada Clean Energy Fund. Section 17 also
41 authorizes such a participating customer to remain continuously enrolled in the
42 program without having to reapply. For community-based solar resources, section
43 17: (1) increases the maximum nameplate capacity from not more than 1 megawatt
44 to not more than 5 megawatts; (2) requires a process for open bidding or requests
45 for proposals for the selection of sites; (3) requires prioritizing the selection of sites
46 that provide resiliency for the electric grid and benefits for the community; and (4)
47 requires construction of additional community-based solar resources in proportion
48 to increased participation in the expanded solar access program.

14 during the billing period is carried forward to the next billing period
15 as an addition to the kilowatt-hours generated by the customer-
16 generator in that billing period. If the customer-generator is billed
17 for electricity pursuant to a time-of-use rate schedule, the excess
18 electricity carried forward must be added to the same time-of-use
19 period as the time-of-use period in which it was generated unless the
20 subsequent billing period lacks a corresponding time-of-use period.
21 In that case, the excess electricity carried forward must be
22 apportioned evenly among the available time-of-use periods.
23 (3) Excess electricity may be carried forward to subsequent
24 billing periods indefinitely, but a customer-generator is not entitled
25 to receive compensation for any excess electricity that remains if:
26 (I) The net metering system ceases to operate or is

35 3. If the cost of purchasing and installing a net metering system
36 was paid for:
37 (a) In whole or in part by a utility, the electricity generated by
38 the net metering system shall be deemed to be electricity that the
39 utility generated or acquired from a renewable energy system for the
40 purposes of complying with its portfolio standard pursuant to NRS
41 704.7801 to 704.7828, inclusive.
42 (b) Entirely by a customer-generator, including, without
