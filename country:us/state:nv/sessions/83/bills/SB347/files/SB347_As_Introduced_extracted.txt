AN ACT relating to public safety; establishing procedures
governing the confiscation and return of firearms
involving persons placed on a mental health crisis hold;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an officer authorized to make arrests in this State and
2 certain providers of health care who, based on personal observation of a person,
3 have probable cause to believe that the person is in a mental health crisis, may
4 place the person on a mental health crisis hold. (NRS 433A.160) Under existing
5 law, a mental health crisis hold is the detention of a person alleged to be a person in
6 a mental health crisis for transport, assessment, evaluation, intervention and
7 treatment, which generally may last not more than 72 hours. (NRS 433A.0175,
8 433A.150)
9 This bill authorizes an officer who places a person on a mental health crisis
10 hold to immediately confiscate a firearm owned or possessed by the person and
11 requires the officer, at the time that the firearm is confiscated, to provide the person
12 with a receipt which describes the firearm and a notice which sets forth the
13 procedures governing the return of the firearm.
14 This bill also requires an administrative officer of a public or private mental
15 health facility or hospital, upon the release of a person who was placed on a mental
16 health crisis hold, to: (1) provide the person with a notice of the procedures
17 governing the return of a confiscated firearm; (2) maintain certain records related to
18 the provision of the notice; and (3) inform the law enforcement agency involved in
19 the placement of the person on the mental health crisis hold of the release of the
20 person.
21 This bill requires the law enforcement agency retaining custody of the
22 confiscated firearm, not later than 30 days after the release of the person from
23 the public or private mental health facility or hospital, to: (1) file a petition with the
24 clerk of the district court to determine whether the return of the firearm to the

25 person would result in the substantial likelihood of serious harm to the person or
26 others; and (2) provide a notice advising the person of the procedure for requesting
27 a hearing on the matter and the potential consequences of failing to request such a
28 hearing.
29 Finally, this bill provides that if a court determines that the return of a firearm
30 would result in a substantial likelihood of serious harm to the person or others or if
31 the court enters an order of default in the matter, the court may authorize the law
32 enforcement agency retaining custody of the confiscated firearm to take certain
33 actions relating to the retention, sale, destruction, trade or donation of the firearm.
