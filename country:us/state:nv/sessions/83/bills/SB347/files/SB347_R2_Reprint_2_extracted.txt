Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an officer authorized to make arrests in this State and
2 certain providers of health care who, based on personal observation of a person,
3 have probable cause to believe that the person is in a mental health crisis, may
4 place the person on a mental health crisis hold. (NRS 433A.160) Under existing
5 law, a mental health crisis hold is the detention of a person alleged to be a person in
6 a mental health crisis for transport, assessment, evaluation, intervention and
7 treatment, which generally may last not more than 72 hours. (NRS 433A.0175,
8 433A.150)
9 Existing law also authorizes an officer who has probable cause to believe that a
10 person poses a risk of causing a self-inflicted injury or a personal injury to another
11 person by possessing or purchasing a firearm to file an application for an order for
12 protection against high-risk behavior. (NRS 33.560) Under existing law, an order
13 for protection against high-risk behavior, among other things, requires the person to
14 surrender any firearm possessed or controlled by the person and prohibits the
15 person from possessing or controlling a firearm while the order is in effect.
16 (NRS 33.590)
17 This bill authorizes an officer to immediately confiscate a firearm that is on the
18 person or in the immediate vicinity of a person placed on a mental health crisis hold
19 and requires the officer, at the time that the firearm is confiscated, to provide the
20 person with a receipt which describes the firearm and a notice which sets forth the
21 procedures governing the return of the firearm.
22 This bill requires the law enforcement agency retaining custody of the
23 confiscated firearm to, upon the release of the person from treatment, return the
24 firearm to the person unless: (1) an officer of the law enforcement agency files a

25 verified application for an order for protection against high-risk behavior; or (2) the
26 person is prohibited by law from owning, possessing or having custody or control
27 of the firearm.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 433A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An officer authorized to make arrests in the State of

17 application for an order for protection against high-risk behavior
18 pursuant to NRS 33.560; or
19 (b) The person is prohibited from owning, possessing or
20 having under his or her custody or control any firearm pursuant
