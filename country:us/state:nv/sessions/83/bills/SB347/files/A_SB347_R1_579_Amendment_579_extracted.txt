Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an officer authorized to make arrests in this State and certain
2 providers of health care who, based on personal observation of a person, have probable cause
3 to believe that the person is in a mental health crisis, may place the person on a mental health
4 crisis hold. (NRS 433A.160) Under existing law, a mental health crisis hold is the detention of
5 a person alleged to be a person in a mental health crisis for transport, assessment, evaluation,
6 intervention and treatment, which generally may last not more than 72 hours. (NRS
7 433A.0175, 433A.150)
8 Existing law also authorizes an officer who has probable cause to believe that a person
9 poses a risk of causing a self-inflicted injury or a personal injury to another person by
10 possessing or purchasing a firearm to file an application for an order for protection against
11 high-risk behavior. (NRS 33.560) Under existing law, an order for protection against high-risk
12 behavior, among other things, requires the person to surrender any firearm possessed or
13 controlled by the person and prohibits the person from possessing or controlling a firearm
14 while the order is in effect. (NRS 33.590)
15 This bill authorizes an officer to immediately confiscate a firearm that is on the person
16 or in the [custody or control or] immediate vicinity of a person placed on a mental health
17 crisis hold and requires the officer, at the time that the firearm is confiscated, to provide the
18 person with a receipt which describes the firearm and a notice which sets forth the procedures
19 governing the return of the firearm.
20 This bill requires the law enforcement agency retaining custody of the confiscated firearm
21 to, upon the release of the person from treatment, return the firearm to the person unless: (1)
22 an officer of the law enforcement agency files a verified application for an order for protection
23 against high-risk behavior; or (2) the person is prohibited by law from owning, possessing or
24 having custody or control of the firearm.
