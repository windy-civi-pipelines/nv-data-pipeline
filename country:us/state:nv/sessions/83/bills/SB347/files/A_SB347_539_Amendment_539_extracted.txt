EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; establishing procedures governing the
confiscation and return of firearms involving persons placed on a
mental health crisis hold; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an officer authorized to make arrests in this State and certain
2 providers of health care who, based on personal observation of a person, have probable cause
3 to believe that the person is in a mental health crisis, may place the person on a mental health
4 crisis hold. (NRS 433A.160) Under existing law, a mental health crisis hold is the detention of
5 a person alleged to be a person in a mental health crisis for transport, assessment, evaluation,
6 intervention and treatment, which generally may last not more than 72 hours. (NRS
7 433A.0175, 433A.150)
8 Existing law also authorizes an officer who has probable cause to believe that a
9 person poses a risk of causing a self-inflicted injury or a personal injury to another
10 person by possessing or purchasing a firearm to file an application for an order for
11 protection against high-risk behavior. (NRS 33.560) Under existing law, an order for
12 protection against high-risk behavior, among other things, requires the person to
13 surrender any firearm possessed or controlled by the person and prohibits the person
14 from possessing or controlling a firearm while the order is in effect. (NRS 33.590)
15 This bill authorizes an officer [who places a person on a mental health crisis hold] to
16 immediately confiscate a firearm [owned or possessed by the] in the custody or control or
17 immediate vicinity of a person placed on a mental health crisis hold and requires the
18 officer, at the time that the firearm is confiscated, to provide the person with a receipt which
19 describes the firearm and a notice which sets forth the procedures governing the return of the
20 firearm.
21 [This bill also requires an administrative officer of a public or private mental health
22 facility or hospital, upon the release of a person who was placed on a mental health crisis
23 hold, to: (1) provide the person with a notice of the procedures governing the return of a
24 confiscated firearm; (2) maintain certain records related to the provision of the notice; and (3)
25 inform the law enforcement agency involved in the placement of the person on the mental
26 health crisis hold of the release of the person.]
27 This bill requires the law enforcement agency retaining custody of the confiscated firearm
28 [, not later than 30 days after] to, upon the release of the person from [the public or private
29 mental health facility or hospital, to: (1) file a petition with the clerk of the district court to
Senate Amendment No. 539 to Senate Bill No. 347 Page 4
30 determine whether the] treatment, return [of] the firearm to the person [would result in the
31 substantial likelihood of serious harm to the person or others; and (2) provide a notice
32 advising the person of the procedure for requesting a hearing on the matter and the potential
33 consequences of failing to request such a hearing.
34 Finally, this bill provides that if a court determines that the return of a firearm would
35 result in a substantial likelihood of serious harm to the person or others or if the court enters
36 an order of default in the matter, the court may authorize the law enforcement agency
37 retaining custody of the confiscated firearm to take certain actions relating to the retention,
38 sale, destruction, trade or donation of the firearm.] unless: (1) an officer of the law
39 enforcement agency files a verified application for an order for protection against high-
40 risk behavior; or (2) the person is prohibited by law from owning, possessing or having
41 custody or control of the firearm.
