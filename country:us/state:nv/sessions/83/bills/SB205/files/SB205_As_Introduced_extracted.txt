States Postal Service to use, the data compiled by the

address of its postal patrons to correct certain portions of
the statewide voter registration list; requiring the county
clerk to publish on the Internet website of the county clerk

2 available to correct the portions of the statewide voter registration list which are
3 relevant to the county clerk and to determine whether a registered voter’s current
4 residence is other than that indicated on the voter’s application to register to vote.
5 (NRS 293.530) Existing law further sets forth various methods for a county clerk to
6 maintain and update the statewide voter registration list, including authorization for
7 the county clerk in each county to enter into an agreement with the United States
8 Postal Service or any person authorized by it to obtain the data compiled by the
9 United States Postal Service concerning changes of addresses of its postal patrons

11 list which are relevant to the county clerk. (NRS 293.530, 293.5303, 293.5307)
