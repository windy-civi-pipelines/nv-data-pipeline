EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of a
school district to determine the percentage of certain
pupils enrolled in the school district; revising the
definition of pupils who are considered a “long-term
English learner” for the purposes of certain reporting;
revising certain factors considered in determining whether
a pupil is eligible for a good-cause exemption to the
requirement that the pupil be retained in grade 3 after not
achieving a passing score on a uniform examination in
reading; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to determine
2 the number of pupils enrolled in schools within the school district who are: (1)
3 immigrants; (2) refugees; (3) new, short-term and long-term English learners; and
4 (4) English learners who participate in various programs, courses or activities,
5 receive a high school diploma and attend an institution of higher education after
6 receiving a high school diploma. Existing law requires the board of trustees of each
7 school district to submit such information to the Department of Education in an
8 annual report and authorizes the Department to make recommendations to the board
9 of trustees of each school district to improve programs for English learners based
10 on the reports. (NRS 388.4073) Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires the board of
11 trustees of each school district to additionally determine the percentage of such
12 pupils enrolled in schools in the district; and (2) changes the definition of “long-
13 term English learner” for the purposes of this report to refer to a pupil who has been

14 classified as an English learner for more than 6 consecutive years after the pupil
15 was first identified as an English learner.
16 Effective July 1, 2028, existing law generally requires a pupil enrolled in grade
17 3 to be retained in grade 3, rather than promoted to grade 4, if the pupil does not
18 obtain a score in the subject area of reading on a uniform examination in reading
19 that meets the passing score prescribed by the State Board of Education. However,
20 existing law also authorizes a pupil to receive a good-cause exemption to allow the
21 pupil to be promoted to grade 4 without obtaining such a score if the principal of
22 the school which the pupil attends determines that the pupil is eligible for such an
23 exemption and submits a recommendation to the superintendent of schools of the
24 school district or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, which the
25 pupil attends. (NRS 392.780, 392.785) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a pupil to
26 qualify for one of the good-cause exemptions by demonstrating, through a portfolio
27 of the pupil’s work, mastery of the academic standards in reading for grade 3 rather
28 than mastery of the academic standards in reading beyond grade 3.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
