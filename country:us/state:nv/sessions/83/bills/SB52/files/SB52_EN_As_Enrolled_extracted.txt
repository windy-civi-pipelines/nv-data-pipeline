Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of a
school district to determine the percentage of certain pupils
enrolled in the school district; revising the definition of
pupils who are considered a “long-term English learner” for
the purposes of certain reporting; revising certain factors
considered in determining whether a pupil is eligible for a
good-cause exemption to the requirement that the pupil be
retained in grade 3 after not achieving a passing score on a
uniform examination in reading; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to determine
the number of pupils enrolled in schools within the school district who are: (1)
immigrants; (2) refugees; (3) new, short-term and long-term English learners; and
(4) English learners who participate in various programs, courses or activities,
receive a high school diploma and attend an institution of higher education after
receiving a high school diploma. Existing law requires the board of trustees of each
school district to submit such information to the Department of Education in an
annual report and authorizes the Department to make recommendations to the board
of trustees of each school district to improve programs for English learners based
on the reports. (NRS 388.4073) Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires the board of
trustees of each school district to additionally determine the percentage of such
pupils enrolled in schools in the district; and (2) changes the definition of “long-
term English learner” for the purposes of this report to refer to a pupil who has been
classified as an English learner for more than 6 consecutive years after the pupil
was first identified as an English learner.
Effective July 1, 2028, existing law generally requires a pupil enrolled in grade
3 to be retained in grade 3, rather than promoted to grade 4, if the pupil does not
obtain a score in the subject area of reading on a uniform examination in reading
that meets the passing score prescribed by the State Board of Education. However,
existing law also authorizes a pupil to receive a good-cause exemption to allow the
pupil to be promoted to grade 4 without obtaining such a score if the principal of
the school which the pupil attends determines that the pupil is eligible for such an
exemption and submits a recommendation to the superintendent of schools of the
school district or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, which the
pupil attends. (NRS 392.780, 392.785) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a pupil to
qualify for one of the good-cause exemptions by demonstrating, through a portfolio
of the pupil’s work, mastery of the academic standards in reading for grade 3 rather
than mastery of the academic standards in reading beyond grade 3.
