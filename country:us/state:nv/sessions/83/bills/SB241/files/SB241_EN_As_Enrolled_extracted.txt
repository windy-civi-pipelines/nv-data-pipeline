Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions limiting the
period during which a juvenile court may place a child on
probation; authorizing the juvenile court to terminate the
probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution
under certain circumstances; prescribing the procedure to be
used by the juvenile court in determining whether to suspend,
modify or revoke the probation of a child; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to place a child on probation under
certain circumstances. With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a juvenile
court from placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months for
each unlawful act for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the
supervision of the juvenile court or placed under informal supervision. (NRS
62E.708) Section 1 of this bill removes language that ties the period during which a
juvenile court may place a child on probation to each unlawful act for which the
child is adjudicated delinquent. Section 1 thereby prohibits a juvenile court from
placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months, regardless of the
number of unlawful acts for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, unless an
exception applies.
Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against a
child or a parent or guardian of a child for any amount of restitution that remains
unpaid after the time established by the juvenile court for its payment. (NRS
62B.420) Under existing law, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over a child,
parent or guardian against whom a civil judgment is entered, regardless of whether
the period of probation of the child has been terminated. (NRS 62B.420, 62E.708)

Section 2:
Section 1 authorizes the juvenile court to terminate the period of probation of a
child who has failed to make full restitution but has otherwise fulfilled the
conditions of his or her probation. If the juvenile court terminates the period of
probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution pursuant to section 1,
existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against the child
or the parent or guardian of the child for the amount due in favor of the victim.
(NRS 62B.420)
Existing law prescribes the procedure to be used by the juvenile court in
determining whether to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of a child who
violates the terms and conditions of his or her parole. Under existing law, pursuant
to this procedure, the juvenile court must: (1) hold a hearing to determine whether
to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of the child; (2) render a decision within 10
days after the conclusion of the hearing; and (3) comply with certain other
requirements. (NRS 63.770) Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to order a
child who violates the terms of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the
detention of children or county jail for not more than 30 days for the violation.
(NRS 62E.710) Section 2 of this bill establishes the procedure to be used by the
juvenile court when a child violates the conditions of his or her probation which is
similar to the procedure established for violations of parole. Section 2 thereby
requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing before ordering a child who violates
the conditions of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the detention of
children or county jail.
