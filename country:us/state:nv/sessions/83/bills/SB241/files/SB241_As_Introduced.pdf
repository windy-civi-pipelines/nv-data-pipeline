EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions limiting the
period during which a juvenile court may place a child on
probation; authorizing the juvenile court to terminate the
probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution
under certain circumstances; prescribing the procedure to
be used by the juvenile court in determining whether to
suspend, modify or revoke the probation of a child; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to place a child on probation under
2 certain circumstances. With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a juvenile
3 court from placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months for
4 each unlawful act for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the
5 supervision of the juvenile court or placed under informal supervision. (NRS
6 62E.708) Section 1 of this bill removes language that ties the period during which a
7 juvenile court may place a child on probation to each unlawful act for which the
8 child is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the supervision of the juvenile court or
9 placed under informal supervision. Section 1 thereby prohibits a juvenile court
10 from placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months, regardless
11 of the number of unlawful acts for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, placed
12 under the supervision of the juvenile court or placed under informal supervision,
13 unless an exception applies.
14 Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against a
15 child or a parent or guardian of a child for any amount of restitution that remains
16 unpaid after the time established by the juvenile court for its payment. (NRS
17 62B.420) Under existing law, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over a child,
-

– 2 –
18 parent or guardian against whom a civil judgment is entered, regardless of whether
19 the period of probation of the child has been terminated. (NRS 62B.420, 62E.708)
20 Section 1 authorizes the juvenile court to terminate the period of probation of a
21 child who has failed to make full restitution but has otherwise fulfilled the
22 conditions of his or her probation. If the juvenile court terminates the period of
23 probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution pursuant to section 1,
24 existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against the child
25 or the parent or guardian of the child for the amount due in favor of the victim.
26 (NRS 62B.420)
27 Existing law prescribes the procedure to be used by the juvenile court in
28 determining whether to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of a child who
29 violates the terms and conditions of his or her parole. Under existing law, pursuant
30 to this procedure, the juvenile court must: (1) hold a hearing to determine whether
31 to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of the child; (2) render a decision within 10
32 days after the conclusion of the hearing; and (3) comply with certain other
33 requirements. (NRS 63.770) Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to order a
34 child who violates the terms of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the
35 detention of children or county jail for not more than 30 days for the violation.
36 (NRS 62E.710) Section 2 of this bill establishes the procedure to be used by the
37 juvenile court when a child violates the conditions of his or her probation which is
38 similar to the procedure established for violations of parole. Section 2 thereby
39 requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing before ordering a child who violates
40 the conditions of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the detention of
41 children or county jail.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

5 the extension results in the child being on probation for a total
6 period of more than 36 months . [for each unlawful act for which the
7 child is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, unless the act
8 relates to a violation of the conditions of probation.]
9 4. A juvenile court may extend the probation of a child beyond
10 the period prescribed by paragraph (c) of subsection 3 if the child,
11 the parent or guardian of the child, the attorney for the child, the
12 probation officer of the child and the district attorney agree to the
13 extension.
14 5. Notice of any hearing by a juvenile court relating to the
15 extension of the probation of a child must be given to the child,
16 the parent or guardian of the child, the attorney for the child and the

34 of a child who has failed to make full restitution as ordered by the

37 amount of restitution that remains unpaid by a child or a parent or
38 guardian of a child after the termination of probation constitutes a

40 9. Notwithstanding the termination of any period of probation
41 ordered by the juvenile court, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction
42 in accordance with the provisions of NRS 62B.420.
