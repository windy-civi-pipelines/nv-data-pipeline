SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to juvenile probation.
(BDR 5-493)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions limiting the
period during which a juvenile court may place a child on
probation; authorizing the juvenile court to terminate the
probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution
under certain circumstances; prescribing the procedure to
be used by the juvenile court in determining whether to
suspend, modify or revoke the probation of a child; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to place a child on probation under
2 certain circumstances. With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a juvenile
3 court from placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months for
4 each unlawful act for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the
5 supervision of the juvenile court or placed under informal supervision. (NRS
6 62E.708) Section 1 of this bill removes language that ties the period during which a
7 juvenile court may place a child on probation to each unlawful act for which the
8 child is adjudicated delinquent. Section 1 thereby prohibits a juvenile court from
9 placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months, regardless of the
10 number of unlawful acts for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, unless an
11 exception applies.
12 Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against a
13 child or a parent or guardian of a child for any amount of restitution that remains
14 unpaid after the time established by the juvenile court for its payment. (NRS
15 62B.420) Under existing law, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over a child,
16 parent or guardian against whom a civil judgment is entered, regardless of whether
17 the period of probation of the child has been terminated. (NRS 62B.420, 62E.708)

– 2 –
18 Section 1 authorizes the juvenile court to terminate the period of probation of a
19 child who has failed to make full restitution but has otherwise fulfilled the
20 conditions of his or her probation. If the juvenile court terminates the period of
21 probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution pursuant to section 1,
22 existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against the child
23 or the parent or guardian of the child for the amount due in favor of the victim.
24 (NRS 62B.420)
25 Existing law prescribes the procedure to be used by the juvenile court in
26 determining whether to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of a child who
27 violates the terms and conditions of his or her parole. Under existing law, pursuant
28 to this procedure, the juvenile court must: (1) hold a hearing to determine whether
29 to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of the child; (2) render a decision within 10
30 days after the conclusion of the hearing; and (3) comply with certain other
31 requirements. (NRS 63.770) Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to order a
32 child who violates the terms of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the
33 detention of children or county jail for not more than 30 days for the violation.
34 (NRS 62E.710) Section 2 of this bill establishes the procedure to be used by the
35 juvenile court when a child violates the conditions of his or her probation which is
36 similar to the procedure established for violations of parole. Section 2 thereby
37 requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing before ordering a child who violates
38 the conditions of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the detention of
39 children or county jail.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

5 plan for the child developed pursuant to NRS 62E.507. Except as
6 otherwise authorized by specific statute or federal law, no single
7 extension of the probation of a child may be for a period of more
8 than 6 months.

10 the extension results in the child being on probation for a total

13 relates to a violation of the conditions of probation.]
14 4. A juvenile court may extend the probation of a child beyond
15 the period prescribed by paragraph (c) of subsection 3 if the child,
16 the parent or guardian of the child, the attorney for the child, the

28 (1) Report of the probation officer of the child relating to the
29 issue of whether the juvenile court should extend the probation of
30 the child;
31 (2) Report prepared by the department of juvenile services
32 pursuant to NRS 62E.506; and

39 of a child who has failed to make full restitution as ordered by the
40 juvenile court but has otherwise fulfilled the conditions of his or
41 her probation for the entire period of his or her probation. Any
42 amount of restitution that remains unpaid by a child or a parent or
43 guardian of a child after the termination of probation constitutes a
44 civil liability, and the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over any
-
*SB241_R1*
– 4 –
1 civil judgment issued against the child or a parent or guardian of
2 the child pursuant to NRS 62B.420.
3 9. Notwithstanding the termination of any period of probation
4 ordered by the juvenile court, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction
5 in accordance with the provisions of NRS 62B.420.
6 10. The provisions of this section do not apply to a violation
7 of the conditions of probation. The juvenile court shall hold a
8 hearing pursuant to NRS 62E.710 before suspending, modifying
9 or revoking the probation of a child.
10 Sec. 2. NRS 62E.710 is hereby amended to read as follows:

AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions limiting the
period during which a juvenile court may place a child on
probation; authorizing the juvenile court to terminate the
probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution
under certain circumstances; prescribing the procedure to
be used by the juvenile court in determining whether to
suspend, modify or revoke the probation of a child; and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to place a child on probation under
2 certain circumstances. With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a juvenile
3 court from placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months for
4 each unlawful act for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the
5 supervision of the juvenile court or placed under informal supervision. (NRS
6 62E.708) Section 1 of this bill removes language that ties the period during which a
7 juvenile court may place a child on probation to each unlawful act for which the

9 placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months, regardless of the
10 number of unlawful acts for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, unless an
11 exception applies.
12 Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against a
13 child or a parent or guardian of a child for any amount of restitution that remains
14 unpaid after the time established by the juvenile court for its payment. (NRS
15 62B.420) Under existing law, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over a child,
16 parent or guardian against whom a civil judgment is entered, regardless of whether
17 the period of probation of the child has been terminated. (NRS 62B.420, 62E.708)

18 Section 1 authorizes the juvenile court to terminate the period of probation of a
19 child who has failed to make full restitution but has otherwise fulfilled the
20 conditions of his or her probation. If the juvenile court terminates the period of
21 probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution pursuant to section 1,
22 existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against the child
23 or the parent or guardian of the child for the amount due in favor of the victim.
24 (NRS 62B.420)
25 Existing law prescribes the procedure to be used by the juvenile court in
26 determining whether to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of a child who
27 violates the terms and conditions of his or her parole. Under existing law, pursuant
28 to this procedure, the juvenile court must: (1) hold a hearing to determine whether
29 to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of the child; (2) render a decision within 10
30 days after the conclusion of the hearing; and (3) comply with certain other

32 child who violates the terms of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the
33 detention of children or county jail for not more than 30 days for the violation.
34 (NRS 62E.710) Section 2 of this bill establishes the procedure to be used by the
35 juvenile court when a child violates the conditions of his or her probation which is
36 similar to the procedure established for violations of parole. Section 2 thereby
37 requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing before ordering a child who violates
38 the conditions of his or her probation to be placed in a facility for the detention of
39 children or county jail.
