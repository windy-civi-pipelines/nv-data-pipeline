AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions limiting the period during
which a juvenile court may place a child on probation; authorizing the
juvenile court to terminate the probation of a child who has failed to
make full restitution under certain circumstances; prescribing the
procedure to be used by the juvenile court in determining whether to
suspend, modify or revoke the probation of a child; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a juvenile court to place a child on probation under certain
2 circumstances. With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a juvenile court from placing a
3 child on probation for a period of more than 18 months for each unlawful act for which the
4 child is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the supervision of the juvenile court or placed
5 under informal supervision. (NRS 62E.708) Section 1 of this bill removes language that ties
6 the period during which a juvenile court may place a child on probation to each unlawful act
7 for which the child is adjudicated delinquent . [, placed under the supervision of the juvenile
8 court or placed under informal supervision.] Section 1 thereby prohibits a juvenile court from
9 placing a child on probation for a period of more than 18 months, regardless of the number of
10 unlawful acts for which the child is adjudicated delinquent, [placed under the supervision of
11 the juvenile court or placed under informal supervision,] unless an exception applies.
12 Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against a child or a
13 parent or guardian of a child for any amount of restitution that remains unpaid after the time
14 established by the juvenile court for its payment. (NRS 62B.420) Under existing law, the
15 juvenile court retains jurisdiction over a child, parent or guardian against whom a civil
16 judgment is entered, regardless of whether the period of probation of the child has been
17 terminated. (NRS 62B.420, 62E.708) Section 1 authorizes the juvenile court to terminate the
18 period of probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution but has otherwise
19 fulfilled the conditions of his or her probation. If the juvenile court terminates the period of
20 probation of a child who has failed to make full restitution pursuant to section 1, existing law
21 authorizes the juvenile court to enter a civil judgment against the child or the parent or
22 guardian of the child for the amount due in favor of the victim. (NRS 62B.420)
23 Existing law prescribes the procedure to be used by the juvenile court in determining
24 whether to suspend, modify or revoke the parole of a child who violates the terms and

Senate Amendment No. 79 to Senate Bill No. 241 Page 4
25 conditions of his or her parole. Under existing law, pursuant to this procedure, the juvenile
26 court must: (1) hold a hearing to determine whether to suspend, modify or revoke the parole
27 of the child; (2) render a decision within 10 days after the conclusion of the hearing; and (3)
28 comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 63.770) Existing law authorizes the juvenile
29 court to order a child who violates the terms of his or her probation to be placed in a facility
30 for the detention of children or county jail for not more than 30 days for the violation. (NRS
31 62E.710) Section 2 of this bill establishes the procedure to be used by the juvenile court when
32 a child violates the conditions of his or her probation which is similar to the procedure
33 established for violations of parole. Section 2 thereby requires the juvenile court to hold a
34 hearing before ordering a child who violates the conditions of his or her probation to be placed
35 in a facility for the detention of children or county jail.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

3 with the provisions of this section.

5 juvenile services pursuant to NRS 62E.506 when determining whether to place a
6 child on probation and the period of any such probation.
7 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section or as expressly authorized by
8 specific statute or federal law:
9 (a) A juvenile court shall not place a child on probation for a period of more
10 than 18 months . [for each unlawful act for which] If the juvenile court adjudicates
11 a child [is adjudicated delinquent, placed under the supervision of the juvenile court
12 pursuant to a supervision and consent decree, or placed under informal supervision.
13 The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to a violation] delinquent for more
14 than one unlawful act at the same time, the terms of probation [or parole.] must
15 run concurrently, not consecutively, for all unlawful acts for which the child is
16 adjudicated delinquent.
17 (b) A juvenile court may order one or more extensions of the probation of a
18 child if the juvenile court finds, based on a preponderance of evidence presented at
19 a hearing on the matter, that such an extension is advisable, considering the
20 individualized case plan for the child developed pursuant to NRS 62E.507. Except
21 as otherwise authorized by specific statute or federal law, no single extension of the
22 probation of a child may be for a period of more than 6 months.
23 (c) A juvenile court may not extend the probation of any child if the extension
24 results in the child being on probation for a total period of more than 36 months .
25 [for each unlawful act for which the child is subject to the jurisdiction of the
26 juvenile court, unless the act relates to a violation of the conditions of probation.]
27 4. A juvenile court may extend the probation of a child beyond the period
28 prescribed by paragraph (c) of subsection 3 if the child, the parent or guardian of
29 the child, the attorney for the child, the probation officer of the child and the district
30 attorney agree to the extension.
31 5. Notice of any hearing by a juvenile court relating to the extension of the
32 probation of a child must be given to the child, the parent or guardian of the child,
33 the attorney for the child and the probation officer of the child.

35 of a child, the juvenile court must:

2 (1) Report of the probation officer of the child relating to the issue of

11 has failed to make full restitution as ordered by the juvenile court but has
12 otherwise fulfilled the conditions of his or her probation for the entire period of
13 his or her probation. Any amount of restitution that remains unpaid by a child or
14 a parent or guardian of a child after the termination of probation constitutes a
15 civil liability , and [is enforceable] the juvenile court retains jurisdiction over any
16 civil judgment issued against the child or a parent or guardian of the child
17 pursuant to NRS 62B.420.
18 9. Notwithstanding the termination of any period of probation ordered by the
19 juvenile court, the juvenile court retains jurisdiction in accordance with the
20 provisions of NRS 62B.420.
21 10. The provisions of this section do not apply to a violation of the
22 conditions of probation. The juvenile court shall hold a hearing pursuant to NRS
23 62E.710 before suspending, modifying or revoking the probation of a child.
24 Sec. 2. NRS 62E.710 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 62E.710 [The] 1. A petition may be filed with the juvenile court to request
26 that the probation of a child be suspended, modified or revoked for a violation of
27 the conditions of probation.

33 prepare for the hearing.

35 conclusion of the hearing.
