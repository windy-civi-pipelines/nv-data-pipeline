AN ACT relating to mental health; establishing provisions related to the discharge

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child with an
2 emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) Section 3 of this bill requires a public or
3 private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a child with an emotional
4 disturbance to establish discharge procedures which prohibit a child from being discharged to
5 a temporary facility . [unless the temporary facility is the only facility that is available to
6 receive the child for treatment.]
7 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
9 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other services to
10 certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or other division facility or
11 who are released on parole or discharged from a state facility for the detention of children; and
12 (2) whose parents or guardians are unable to accept the child back into the home after the
13 discharge or release because of a health or safety risk. Section 2.6 also requires : (1) the
14 Administrator of the Division to appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice
15 and mental health systems to the task force [. Section 2.8 of this bill establishes certain criteria
16 for the recommendations and requires] ; and (2) the task force to submit its
Assembly Amendment No. 732 to Senate Bill No. 306 Second Reprint Page 4
17 recommendations to [be submitted to] the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
18 Human Services.
19 Existing law defines [certain terms, including,] “child with an emotional disturbance” for
20 the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS
21 [433B.020-433B.100)] 433B.045) Section 6 of this bill revises the definition of “child with an
22 emotional disturbance” to provide that the term includes, without limitation, a child with a
23 severe emotional disturbance. [(NRS 433B.045)
24 Sections 7 and 9 of this bill remove and repeal certain provisions that contain a definition
25 of “agency which provides child welfare services” for the purpose of consolidating the
26 provisions into a single definition under section 2.4 of this bill. Section 5 of this bill makes a
27 conforming change to indicate that the consolidated definition of “agency which provides
28 child welfare services” applies to the provisions of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 8 of this bill
29 makes a conforming change related to the consolidated definition.]
30 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services for
31 the mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 10 of this
32 bill makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that currently
33 provide these mental health services to children.
34 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
35 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim
36 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with
37 the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category
38 D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those
39 circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law
40 provides that if a person commits a battery upon an officer, and the person knew or
41 should have known that the victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B
42 felony if the battery causes substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or
43 (2) if those circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a
44 gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the definition of
45 “officer” to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
46 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public;
47 and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or
48 other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; establishing provisions related to the discharge
of a child with an emotional disturbance from certain inpatient
psychiatric treatment facilities; establishing a task force to develop
recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing
and other services to certain children who are discharged from a
treatment facility or certain other facilities or released on parole;
revising provisions related to the designation of certain facilities of
the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of
Health and Human Services; expanding the applicability of
enhanced penalties for assault or battery against certain persons
who provide child welfare services or child protective services; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child with an
2 emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) Section 3 of this bill requires a public or
3 private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a child with an emotional
4 disturbance to establish discharge procedures which prohibit a child from being discharged to
5 a temporary facility . [unless the temporary facility is the only facility that is available to
6 receive the child for treatment.]
7 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
9 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other services to
10 certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or other division facility or
11 who are released on parole or discharged from a state facility for the detention of children; and
12 (2) whose parents or guardians are unable to accept the child back into the home after the
13 discharge or release because of a health or safety risk. Section 2.6 also requires : (1) the
14 Administrator of the Division to appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice
15 and mental health systems to the task force [. Section 2.8 of this bill establishes certain criteria
16 for the recommendations and requires] ; and (2) the task force to submit its

Assembly Amendment No. 732 to Senate Bill No. 306 Second Reprint Page 4
17 recommendations to [be submitted to] the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
18 Human Services.
19 Existing law defines [certain terms, including,] “child with an emotional disturbance” for
20 the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS
21 [433B.020-433B.100)] 433B.045) Section 6 of this bill revises the definition of “child with an
22 emotional disturbance” to provide that the term includes, without limitation, a child with a
23 severe emotional disturbance. [(NRS 433B.045)
24 Sections 7 and 9 of this bill remove and repeal certain provisions that contain a definition
25 of “agency which provides child welfare services” for the purpose of consolidating the
26 provisions into a single definition under section 2.4 of this bill. Section 5 of this bill makes a
27 conforming change to indicate that the consolidated definition of “agency which provides
28 child welfare services” applies to the provisions of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 8 of this bill
29 makes a conforming change related to the consolidated definition.]
30 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services for
31 the mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 10 of this
32 bill makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that currently
33 provide these mental health services to children.
34 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
35 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim
36 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with
37 the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category
38 D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those
39 circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law
40 provides that if a person commits a battery upon an officer, and the person knew or
41 should have known that the victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B
42 felony if the battery causes substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or
43 (2) if those circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a
44 gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the definition of
45 “officer” to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
46 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public;
47 and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or
48 other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.
