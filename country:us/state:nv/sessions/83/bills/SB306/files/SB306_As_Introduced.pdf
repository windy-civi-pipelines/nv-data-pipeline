9 facility that is authorized to receive reimbursements from Medicaid for services
10 provided to a child with an emotional disturbance to accept a child for treatment at
11 the facility unless the facility determines that it does not have the availability or
12 resources to provide adequate treatment to the child, in which case the facility must
13 identify an alternative facility from which the child could receive treatment and
14 assist with the admission of the child at the identified facility.
