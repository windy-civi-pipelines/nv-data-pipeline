AN ACT relating to mental health; [establishing provisions related to the discharge
of a child with an emotional disturbance from certain inpatient
psychiatric treatment facilities;] establishing a task force to develop
recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing
and other services to certain children who are discharged from a
treatment facility or certain other facilities or released on parole;
revising provisions related to the designation of certain facilities of the
Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
Human Services; expanding the applicability of enhanced penalties for
assault or battery against certain persons who provide child welfare
services or child protective services; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child with an
2 emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) [Section 3 of this bill requires a public or
3 private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a child with an emotional
4 disturbance to establish discharge procedures which prohibit a child from being discharged to
5 a temporary facility.]
6 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
7 Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
8 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other services to
9 certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or other division facility or
10 who are released on parole or discharged from a state facility for the detention of children; and
11 (2) whose parents or guardians are unable to accept the child back into the home after the
12 discharge or release because of a health or safety risk. Section 2.6 also requires: (1) the
13 Administrator of the Division to appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice
14 and mental health systems to the task force; and (2) the task force to submit its
15 recommendations to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
Assembly Amendment No. 975 to Senate Bill No. 306 Third Reprint Page 4
16 Existing law defines “child with an emotional disturbance” for the purposes of chapter
17 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS 433B.045) Section 6 of this bill
18 revises the definition of “child with an emotional disturbance” to provide that the term
19 includes, without limitation, a child with a severe emotional disturbance.
20 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services for the
21 mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 10 of this bill
22 makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that currently provide these
23 mental health services to children.
24 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
25 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
26 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
27 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the
28 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
29 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
30 commits a battery upon an officer, and the person knew or should have known that the victim
31 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
32 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and
33 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and
34 12 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” to include an employee of this State or a
35 political subdivision of this State whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to:
36 (1) interact with the public; and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child
37 protective services or other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; [establishing provisions related to the discharge
of a child with an emotional disturbance from certain inpatient
psychiatric treatment facilities;] establishing a task force to develop
recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing
and other services to certain children who are discharged from a
treatment facility or certain other facilities or released on parole;
revising provisions related to the designation of certain facilities of the
Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
Human Services; expanding the applicability of enhanced penalties for
assault or battery against certain persons who provide child welfare
services or child protective services; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child with an
2 emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) [Section 3 of this bill requires a public or
3 private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a child with an emotional
4 disturbance to establish discharge procedures which prohibit a child from being discharged to
5 a temporary facility.]
6 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
7 Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
8 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other services to
9 certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or other division facility or
10 who are released on parole or discharged from a state facility for the detention of children; and
11 (2) whose parents or guardians are unable to accept the child back into the home after the
12 discharge or release because of a health or safety risk. Section 2.6 also requires: (1) the
13 Administrator of the Division to appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice
14 and mental health systems to the task force; and (2) the task force to submit its
15 recommendations to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.

Assembly Amendment No. 975 to Senate Bill No. 306 Third Reprint Page 4
16 Existing law defines “child with an emotional disturbance” for the purposes of chapter
17 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS 433B.045) Section 6 of this bill
18 revises the definition of “child with an emotional disturbance” to provide that the term
19 includes, without limitation, a child with a severe emotional disturbance.
20 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services for the
21 mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 10 of this bill
22 makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that currently provide these
23 mental health services to children.
24 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
25 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
26 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
27 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the
28 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
29 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
30 commits a battery upon an officer, and the person knew or should have known that the victim
31 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
32 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and
33 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and
34 12 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” to include an employee of this State or a
35 political subdivision of this State whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to:
36 (1) interact with the public; and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child
37 protective services or other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.
