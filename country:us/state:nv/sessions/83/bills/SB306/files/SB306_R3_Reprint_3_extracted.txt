Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child
2 with an emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) Section 3 of this bill
3 requires a public or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a
4 child with an emotional disturbance to establish discharge procedures which
5 prohibit a child from being discharged to a temporary facility.
6 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of
7 the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
8 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other
9 services to certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or
-
*SB306_R3*
– 2 –
10 other division facility or who are released on parole or discharged from a state
11 facility for the detention of children; and (2) whose parents or guardians are unable
12 to accept the child back into the home after the discharge or release because of a
13 health or safety risk. Section 2.6 also requires: (1) the Administrator of the Division
14 to appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice and mental health
15 systems to the task force; and (2) the task force to submit its recommendations to
16 the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
17 Existing law defines “child with an emotional disturbance” for the purposes of
18 chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS 433B.045)
19 Section 6 of this bill revises the definition of “child with an emotional disturbance”
20 to provide that the term includes, without limitation, a child with a severe emotional
21 disturbance.
22 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services
23 for the mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section
24 10 of this bill makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that
25 currently provide these mental health services to children.
26 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
27 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
28 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
29 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
30 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
31 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
32 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
33 upon an officer, and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
34 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
35 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
36 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
37 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the definition
38 of “officer” to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this
39 State whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with
40 the public; and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective
41 services or other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; establishing provisions related to
the discharge of a child with an emotional disturbance
from certain inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities;
establishing a task force to develop recommendations for
the creation of a program that provides housing and other
services to certain children who are discharged from a

parole; revising provisions related to the designation of
certain facilities of the Division of Child and Family
Services of the Department of Health and Human
Services; expanding the applicability of enhanced
penalties for assault or battery against certain persons who

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child
2 with an emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) Section 3 of this bill
3 requires a public or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a
4 child with an emotional disturbance to establish discharge procedures which
5 prohibit a child from being discharged to a temporary facility.
6 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of
7 the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
8 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other
9 services to certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or
-
*SB306_R3*

– 2 –
10 other division facility or who are released on parole or discharged from a state
11 facility for the detention of children; and (2) whose parents or guardians are unable
12 to accept the child back into the home after the discharge or release because of a
13 health or safety risk. Section 2.6 also requires: (1) the Administrator of the Division
14 to appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice and mental health
15 systems to the task force; and (2) the task force to submit its recommendations to
16 the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
17 Existing law defines “child with an emotional disturbance” for the purposes of
18 chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS 433B.045)
19 Section 6 of this bill revises the definition of “child with an emotional disturbance”
20 to provide that the term includes, without limitation, a child with a severe emotional
21 disturbance.
22 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services
23 for the mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section
24 10 of this bill makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that
25 currently provide these mental health services to children.
26 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
27 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
28 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
29 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
30 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
31 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
32 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
33 upon an officer, and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
34 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
35 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
36 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
37 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the definition
38 of “officer” to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this
39 State whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with
40 the public; and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective
41 services or other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.
