Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of Child and Family Services
2 of the Department of Health and Human Services to perform certain duties relating to
3 the mental health of children. Among other things, the Administrator is required to
4 accept and provide services to a child who has been determined to be incompetent by a
5 juvenile court. (NRS 433B.130) Section 3.5 of this bill additionally requires the
6 Administrator to accept and provide services to a child who is subject to certain orders
7 pursuant to chapter 62E or 432B of NRS. If the order requires the child to be committed
8 to a treatment facility, section 3.5 also requires the Administrator to place the child in
9 the treatment facility not later than 30 days after receipt of the order under certain
10 circumstances.
11 Existing law authorizes the Administrator [of the Division of Child and Family Services
12 of the Department of Health and Human Services] to receive a child with an emotional
13 disturbance for treatment in certain treatment facilities if the child is a resident of this State
14 and: (1) the child is committed by a court order; or (2) a parent or legal guardian makes
15 application for treatment for the child. (NRS 433B.310) Section 4 of this bill makes various
16 changes to provide that any such child with an emotional disturbance may be admitted to a
17 treatment facility.
18 [Section 2 of this bill requires a public or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility
19 that is authorized to receive reimbursements from Medicaid for services provided to a child
20 with an emotional disturbance to accept a child for treatment at the facility unless the facility
21 determines that it does not have the availability or resources to provide adequate treatment to

22 the child, in which case the facility must identify an alternative facility from which the child
23 could receive treatment and assist with the admission of the child at the identified facility.
24 Section 2 also requires certain public or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities
25 that are authorized to receive reimbursements from Medicaid to develop a plan to provide
26 services to children with emotional disturbances under certain circumstances.]
27 Section 3 of this bill requires a public or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility
28 that admits a child with an emotional disturbance to [prepare a] establish discharge [plan]
29 procedures which must [be shared with and agreed to by] : (1) require a court to approve
30 the discharge plan of the child if each parent or legal guardian of the child [before the
31 release of the child from the facility.] does not approve of the discharge plan; (2) prohibit a
32 child from being discharged to a temporary facility; and (3) require approval by an
33 agency which provides child welfare services before receiving the child after discharge.
