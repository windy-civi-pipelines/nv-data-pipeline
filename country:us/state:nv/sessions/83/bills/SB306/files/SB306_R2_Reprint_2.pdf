thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child
2 with an emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) Section 3 of this bill
3 requires a public or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a
4 child with an emotional disturbance to establish discharge procedures which
5 prohibit a child from being discharged to a temporary facility unless the temporary
6 facility is the only facility that is available to receive the child for treatment.
7 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of
8 the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
9 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other
10 services to certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or
11 other division facility or who are released on parole or discharged from a state
12 facility for the detention of children; and (2) whose parents or guardians are unable
13 to accept the child back into the home after the discharge or release because of a
14 health or safety risk. Section 2.6 requires the Administrator of the Division to
15 appoint representatives of the child welfare, juvenile justice and mental health
16 systems to the task force. Section 2.8 of this bill establishes certain criteria for the

17 recommendations and requires the recommendations to be submitted to the Joint
18 Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
19 Existing law defines certain terms, including, “child with an emotional
20 disturbance” for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health
21 of children. (NRS 433B.020-433B.100) Section 6 of this bill revises the definition
22 of “child with an emotional disturbance” to provide that the term includes, without
23 limitation, a child with a severe emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.045)
24 Sections 7 and 9 of this bill remove and repeal certain provisions that contain a
25 definition of “agency which provides child welfare services” for the purpose of
26 consolidating the provisions into a single definition under section 2.4 of this bill.
27 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the consolidated
28 definition of “agency which provides child welfare services” applies to the
29 provisions of chapter 433B of NRS. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming
30 change related to the consolidated definition.
