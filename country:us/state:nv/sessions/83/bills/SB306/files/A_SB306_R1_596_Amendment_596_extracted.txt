AN ACT relating to mental health; [revising provisions relating to the duties of the
Administrator of the Division of Child and Family Services of the
Department of Health and Human Services;] establishing provisions
related to the discharge of a child with an emotional disturbance from
certain inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities; establishing a task
force to develop recommendations for the creation of a program
that provides housing and other services to certain children who
are discharged from a treatment facility or certain other facilities
or released on parole; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of Child and Family Services of
2 the Department of Health and Human Services to perform certain duties relating to the mental
3 health of children. Among other things, the Administrator is required to accept and provide
4 services to a child who has been determined to be incompetent by a juvenile court. (NRS
5 433B.130) Section 3.5 of this bill additionally requires the Administrator to accept and
6 provide services to a child who is subject to certain orders pursuant to chapter 62E or 432B of
7 NRS. If the order requires the child to be committed to a treatment facility, section 3.5 also
8 requires the Administrator to place the child in the treatment facility not later than 30 days
9 after receipt of the order under certain circumstances.
10 Existing law authorizes the Administrator to receive a child with an emotional
11 disturbance for treatment in certain treatment facilities if the child is a resident of this State
12 and: (1) the child is committed by a court order; or (2) a parent or legal guardian makes
13 application for treatment for the child. (NRS 433B.310) Section 4 of this bill makes various
14 changes to provide that any such child with an emotional disturbance may be admitted to a
15 treatment facility.]
16 Existing law imposes certain requirements concerning the treatment of a child with
17 an emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.290-433B.339) Section 3 of this bill requires a public
18 or private inpatient psychiatric treatment facility that admits a child with an emotional
19 disturbance to establish discharge procedures which [must: (1) require a court to approve the
Assembly Amendment No. 596 to Senate Bill No. 306 First Reprint Page 4
20 discharge plan of the child if each parent or legal guardian of the child does not approve of the
21 discharge plan; (2)] prohibit a child from being discharged to a temporary facility [; and (3)
22 require approval by an agency which provides child welfare services before receiving the
23 child after discharge.] unless the temporary facility is the only facility that is available to
24 receive the child for treatment.
25 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
26 Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
27 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other services
28 to certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or other division
29 facility or who are released on parole or discharged from a state facility for the detention
30 of children; and (2) whose parents or guardians are unable to accept the child back into
31 the home after the discharge or release because of a health or safety risk. Section 2.6
32 requires the Administrator of the Division to appoint representatives of the child
33 welfare, juvenile justice and mental health systems to the task force. Section 2.8 of this
34 bill establishes certain criteria for the recommendations and requires the
35 recommendations to be submitted to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health
36 and Human Services.
37 Existing law defines certain terms, including, “child with an emotional disturbance”
38 for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS
39 433B.020-433B.100) Section 6 of this bill revises the definition of “child with an
40 emotional disturbance” to provide that the term includes, without limitation, a child
41 with a severe emotional disturbance. (NRS 433B.045)
42 Sections 7 and 9 of this bill remove and repeal certain provisions that contain a
43 definition of “agency which provides child welfare services” for the purpose of
44 consolidating the provisions into a single definition under section 2.4 of this bill. Section
45 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the consolidated definition of
46 “agency which provides child welfare services” applies to the provisions of chapter 433B
47 of NRS. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the consolidated
48 definition.
