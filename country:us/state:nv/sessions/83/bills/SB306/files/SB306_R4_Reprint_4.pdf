3 Section 2.6 of this bill requires the Division of Child and Family Services of
4 the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a task force to develop
5 recommendations for the creation of a program that provides housing and other
6 services to certain children: (1) who are discharged from a treatment facility or
7 other division facility or who are released on parole or discharged from a state
8 facility for the detention of children; and (2) whose parents or guardians are unable

12 systems to the task force; and (2) the task force to submit its recommendations to
13 the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
14 Existing law defines “child with an emotional disturbance” for the purposes of
15 chapter 433B of NRS related to the mental health of children. (NRS 433B.045)
16 Section 6 of this bill revises the definition of “child with an emotional disturbance”
17 to provide that the term includes, without limitation, a child with a severe emotional
18 disturbance.
19 Existing law designates certain facilities of the Division which provide services
20 for the mental health of children for the purposes of chapter 433B of NRS. Section
21 10 of this bill makes various changes to designate the facilities of the Division that
22 currently provide these mental health services to children.
23 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
24 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
25 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
26 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
27 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
28 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
29 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
30 upon an officer, and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
31 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
32 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
33 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
34 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the definition
35 of “officer” to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this
36 State whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with
37 the public; and (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective
38 services or other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger.
