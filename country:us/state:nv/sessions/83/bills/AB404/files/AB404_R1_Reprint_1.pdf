AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; authorizing a person who
operates a brew pub to engage in certain activities
concerning the sale of alcoholic beverages; requiring
payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer
for delivery of certain alcoholic beverages to be made by
electronic funds transfer; requiring certain persons
manufacturing liquor to preserve certain records for
inspection and audit by the Department of Taxation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State.
2 (NRS 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or
3 more brew pubs to sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off
4 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2)
5 manufactured and sealed in packages on the premises of any of the brew pubs for
6 consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 of this bill additionally
7 authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to sell at retail any other
8 alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has obtained any
9 license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in
10 which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a
11 licensed wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic
12 beverages, including, without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the
13 premises of one or more of the brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than
14 two retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person if: (1) the
-

– 2 –
15 person has obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at
16 retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is located; (2) the
17 person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3) the
18 retail liquor store is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment;
19 and (4) the retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew
20 pub, with certain exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store
21 locations set forth in section 2, section 6 provides that a person who, on March 31,
22 2025, holds a license to operate a brew pub and any license or permit to operate
23 three retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person is
24 authorized to engage in the activities authorized by section 2 at the third location so
25 long as the license for that location is not transferred to another person or location.
26 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
27 manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
28 person operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to
29 manufacture and sell 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
30 person operates in this State provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located
31 outside of this State. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell
32 the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a wholesaler located outside of this
33 State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to persons residing in states
34 outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who operates a brew pub
35 and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to comply with
36 certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
37 and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the
38 brew pub and each retail liquor store location.
39 Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit
40 and all retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department
41 of Taxation and its agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors
42 purchased or received, specifying certain information relating to those purchases
43 and receipts. (NRS 369.520) Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such
44 recordkeeping requirements on all persons manufacturing liquor.
45 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor
46 store under certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery
47 of that liquor. (NRS 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires payment from a
48 retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of beer, wine or distilled
49 spirits to be made by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires the wholesale dealer to
50 initiate the electronic funds transfer by initiating the withdrawal of funds from the
51 bank account of the retail liquor store; (3) requires the electronic funds transfer to
52 be completed not later than the expiration of the 30th day after the date of delivery
53 of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a wholesale dealer from
54 paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any fees incurred by the
55 retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer.
