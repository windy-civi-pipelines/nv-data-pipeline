Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State.
(NRS 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or
more brew pubs to sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off
the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2)
manufactured and sealed in packages on the premises of any of the brew pubs for
consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 of this bill additionally
authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to sell at retail any other
alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has obtained any
license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in
which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a
licensed wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic
beverages, including, without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the
premises of one or more of the brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than
two retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person if: (1) the
person has obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at
retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is located; (2) the
person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3) for a
retail liquor store location for which the person obtained any license or permit
required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail on or after January 1, 2025, the retail
liquor store location is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment;
and (4) the retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew
pub, with certain exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store
locations set forth in section 2, section 6 of this bill provides that a person who, on
March 31, 2025, holds a license to operate a brew pub and any license or permit to
operate three retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person is
authorized to engage in the activities authorized by section 2 at the third location so
long as the license for that location is not transferred to another person or location.
Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
person operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to
manufacture and sell 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
person operates in this State provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located
outside of this State. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell
the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a wholesaler located outside of this
State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to persons residing in states
outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who operates a brew pub
and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to comply with
certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the
brew pub and each retail liquor store location.
Existing law provides for the licensure of persons engaged in various activities
relating to intoxicating liquor. (Chapter 369 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the
board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to
investigate complaints against a licensee, conduct hearings and recommend to the
Department of Taxation, under certain circumstances, the revocation or suspension
of a license. (NRS 369.230-369.290) Sections 3.1-3.6 of this bill, in general,
provide for the Department to also perform these functions in the same manner as a
board of county commissioners or governing body of a city and authorize the
Department to revoke or suspend a license without receiving a recommendation
from a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city.
Existing law authorizes the Department, under certain circumstances, to issue a
summary suspension of the license of a licensee if the Department finds that the
licensee is violating any of the provisions of existing law governing intoxicating
liquor. (NRS 369.280) Section 3.6 requires the Department, after issuing a
summary suspension, to hold a hearing and render a decision regarding whether to
issue a final order revoking or refusing to revoke the license of the licensee.
Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit
and all retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department
of Taxation and its agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors
purchased or received, specifying certain information relating to those purchases
and receipts. (NRS 369.520) Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such
recordkeeping requirements on all persons manufacturing liquor.
Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor
store under certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery
of that liquor. (NRS 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) with certain exceptions,
requires payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of
beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires
the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds transfer by initiating the
withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store; (3) requires the
electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the 30th
day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a
wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any
fees incurred by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Section
4 also authorizes a retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or
distilled spirits by credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, section 4 requires the
retail liquor store to notify the wholesale dealer of the election. The retail liquor
store is responsible for all costs associated with processing the credit card
transaction. Finally, section 4 requires, at the time a wholesale dealer makes a
delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to a retail liquor store: (1) the wholesale
dealer and retail liquor store to review the invoice of the delivery for accuracy; and
(2) if the invoice is accurate, the retail liquor store to sign the invoice to confirm the
accuracy of the invoice.

Assembly Bill No. 404–Assemblymembers Watts; Brown-May,
Kasama, Nguyen and Torres-Fossett
Joint Sponsor: Senator Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; authorizing a person who
operates a brew pub to engage in certain activities concerning
the sale of alcoholic beverages; revising provisions governing
the conduct of certain investigations and hearings and the
revocation and suspension of certain licenses relating to
intoxicating liquor; revising the manner in which a payment
from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for delivery of
certain alcoholic beverages must be made; requiring certain
persons manufacturing liquor to preserve certain records for
inspection and audit by the Department of Taxation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State.
(NRS 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or
more brew pubs to sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off
the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2)
manufactured and sealed in packages on the premises of any of the brew pubs for
consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 of this bill additionally
authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to sell at retail any other
alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has obtained any
license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in
which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a
licensed wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic
beverages, including, without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the
premises of one or more of the brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than
two retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person if: (1) the
person has obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at
retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is located; (2) the
person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3) for a
retail liquor store location for which the person obtained any license or permit
required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail on or after January 1, 2025, the retail
liquor store location is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment;
and (4) the retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew
pub, with certain exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store
locations set forth in section 2, section 6 of this bill provides that a person who, on
March 31, 2025, holds a license to operate a brew pub and any license or permit to
operate three retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person is
authorized to engage in the activities authorized by section 2 at the third location so
long as the license for that location is not transferred to another person or location.
Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
person operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to
manufacture and sell 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
person operates in this State provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located
outside of this State. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell
the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a wholesaler located outside of this
State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to persons residing in states
outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who operates a brew pub
and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to comply with
certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the
brew pub and each retail liquor store location.
Existing law provides for the licensure of persons engaged in various activities
relating to intoxicating liquor. (Chapter 369 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the
board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to
investigate complaints against a licensee, conduct hearings and recommend to the
Department of Taxation, under certain circumstances, the revocation or suspension
of a license. (NRS 369.230-369.290) Sections 3.1-3.6 of this bill, in general,
provide for the Department to also perform these functions in the same manner as a
board of county commissioners or governing body of a city and authorize the
Department to revoke or suspend a license without receiving a recommendation
from a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city.
Existing law authorizes the Department, under certain circumstances, to issue a
summary suspension of the license of a licensee if the Department finds that the
licensee is violating any of the provisions of existing law governing intoxicating
liquor. (NRS 369.280) Section 3.6 requires the Department, after issuing a
summary suspension, to hold a hearing and render a decision regarding whether to
issue a final order revoking or refusing to revoke the license of the licensee.
Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit
and all retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department
of Taxation and its agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors
purchased or received, specifying certain information relating to those purchases
and receipts. (NRS 369.520) Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such
recordkeeping requirements on all persons manufacturing liquor.
Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor
store under certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery
of that liquor. (NRS 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) with certain exceptions,
requires payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of
beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires
the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds transfer by initiating the
withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store; (3) requires the
electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the 30th
day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a
wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any
fees incurred by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Section
4 also authorizes a retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or
distilled spirits by credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, section 4 requires the
retail liquor store to notify the wholesale dealer of the election. The retail liquor
store is responsible for all costs associated with processing the credit card
transaction. Finally, section 4 requires, at the time a wholesale dealer makes a
delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to a retail liquor store: (1) the wholesale
dealer and retail liquor store to review the invoice of the delivery for accuracy; and
(2) if the invoice is accurate, the retail liquor store to sign the invoice to confirm the
accuracy of the invoice.
