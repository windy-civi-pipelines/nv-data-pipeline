Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State. (NRS
2 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to
3 sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off the premises of any of the
4 brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2) manufactured and sealed in packages on
5 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230)
6 Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to
7 sell at retail any other alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has
8 obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction
9 in which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed
10 wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic beverages, including,
11 without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the premises of one or more of the
12 brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than two retail liquor store locations under the
13 common control of the person if: (1) the person has obtained any license or permit required to
14 sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is
15 located; (2) the person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3)
16 for a retail liquor store location for which the person obtained any license or permit
17 required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail on or after January 1, 2025, the retail liquor
Assembly Amendment No. 859 to Assembly Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 4
18 store location is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment; and (4) the
19 retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew pub, with certain
20 exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store locations set forth in section
21 2, section 6 of this bill provides that a person who, on March 31, 2025, holds a license to
22 operate a brew pub and any license or permit to operate three retail liquor store locations
23 under the common control of the person is authorized to engage in the activities authorized by
24 section 2 at the third location so long as the license for that location is not transferred to
25 another person or location.
26 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
27 manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the person
28 operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to manufacture and sell
29 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the person operates in this State
30 provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located outside of this State. (NRS 597.230)
31 Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a
32 wholesaler located outside of this State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to
33 persons residing in states outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who
34 operates a brew pub and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to
35 comply with certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
36 and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the brew pub
37 and each retail liquor store location.
38 Existing law provides for the licensure of persons engaged in various activities
39 relating to intoxicating liquor. (Chapter 369 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the board
40 of county commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to investigate
41 complaints against a licensee, conduct hearings and recommend to the Department of
42 Taxation, under certain circumstances, the revocation or suspension of a license. (NRS
43 369.230-369.290) Sections 3.1-3.6 of this bill, in general, provide for the Department to
44 also perform these functions in the same manner as a board of county commissioners or
45 governing body of a city and authorize the Department to revoke or suspend a license
46 without receiving a recommendation from a board of county commissioners or
47 governing body of a city.
48 Existing law authorizes the Department, under certain circumstances, to issue a
49 summary suspension of the license of a licensee if the Department finds that the licensee
50 is violating any of the provisions of existing law governing intoxicating liquor. (NRS
51 369.280) Section 3.6 requires the Department, after issuing a summary suspension, to
52 hold a hearing and render a decision regarding whether to issue a final order revoking
53 or refusing to revoke the license of the licensee.
54 Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit and all
55 retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department of Taxation and its
56 agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors purchased or received,
57 specifying certain information relating to those purchases and receipts. (NRS 369.520)
58 Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such recordkeeping requirements on all persons
59 manufacturing liquor.
60 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor store under
61 certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery of that liquor. (NRS
62 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) with certain exceptions, requires payment from a retail
63 liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made
64 by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds
65 transfer by initiating the withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store;
66 (3) requires the electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the
67 30th day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a
68 wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any fees incurred
69 by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Section 4 also authorizes a
70 retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits by
71 credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, section 4 requires the retail liquor store to
72 notify the wholesale dealer of the election. The retail liquor store is responsible for all
73 costs associated with processing the credit card transaction. Finally, section 4 requires,
74 at the time a wholesale dealer makes a delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to a retail
75 liquor store: (1) the wholesale dealer and retail liquor store to review the invoice of the
Assembly Amendment No. 859 to Assembly Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 5
76 delivery for accuracy; and (2) if the invoice is accurate, the retail liquor store to sign the
77 invoice to confirm the accuracy of the invoice.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; authorizing a person who operates a brew
pub to engage in certain activities concerning the sale of alcoholic
beverages; revising provisions governing the conduct of certain
investigations and hearings and the revocation and suspension of
certain licenses relating to intoxicating liquor; [requiring] revising
the manner in which a payment from a retail liquor store to a
wholesale dealer for delivery of certain alcoholic beverages [to] must
be made ; [by electronic funds transfer;] requiring certain persons
manufacturing liquor to preserve certain records for inspection and
audit by the Department of Taxation; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State. (NRS
2 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to
3 sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off the premises of any of the
4 brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2) manufactured and sealed in packages on
5 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230)
6 Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to
7 sell at retail any other alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has
8 obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction
9 in which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed
10 wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic beverages, including,
11 without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the premises of one or more of the
12 brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than two retail liquor store locations under the
13 common control of the person if: (1) the person has obtained any license or permit required to
14 sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is
15 located; (2) the person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3)
16 for a retail liquor store location for which the person obtained any license or permit
17 required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail on or after January 1, 2025, the retail liquor

Assembly Amendment No. 859 to Assembly Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 4
18 store location is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment; and (4) the
19 retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew pub, with certain
20 exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store locations set forth in section
21 2, section 6 of this bill provides that a person who, on March 31, 2025, holds a license to
22 operate a brew pub and any license or permit to operate three retail liquor store locations
23 under the common control of the person is authorized to engage in the activities authorized by
24 section 2 at the third location so long as the license for that location is not transferred to
25 another person or location.
26 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
27 manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the person
28 operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to manufacture and sell
29 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the person operates in this State
30 provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located outside of this State. (NRS 597.230)
31 Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a
32 wholesaler located outside of this State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to
33 persons residing in states outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who
34 operates a brew pub and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to
35 comply with certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
36 and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the brew pub
37 and each retail liquor store location.
38 Existing law provides for the licensure of persons engaged in various activities
39 relating to intoxicating liquor. (Chapter 369 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the board
40 of county commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to investigate
41 complaints against a licensee, conduct hearings and recommend to the Department of
42 Taxation, under certain circumstances, the revocation or suspension of a license. (NRS
43 369.230-369.290) Sections 3.1-3.6 of this bill, in general, provide for the Department to
44 also perform these functions in the same manner as a board of county commissioners or
45 governing body of a city and authorize the Department to revoke or suspend a license
46 without receiving a recommendation from a board of county commissioners or
47 governing body of a city.
48 Existing law authorizes the Department, under certain circumstances, to issue a
49 summary suspension of the license of a licensee if the Department finds that the licensee
50 is violating any of the provisions of existing law governing intoxicating liquor. (NRS
51 369.280) Section 3.6 requires the Department, after issuing a summary suspension, to
52 hold a hearing and render a decision regarding whether to issue a final order revoking
53 or refusing to revoke the license of the licensee.
54 Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit and all
55 retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department of Taxation and its
56 agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors purchased or received,
57 specifying certain information relating to those purchases and receipts. (NRS 369.520)
58 Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such recordkeeping requirements on all persons
59 manufacturing liquor.
60 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor store under
61 certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery of that liquor. (NRS
62 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) with certain exceptions, requires payment from a retail
63 liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made
64 by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds
65 transfer by initiating the withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store;
66 (3) requires the electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the
67 30th day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a
68 wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any fees incurred
69 by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Section 4 also authorizes a
70 retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits by
71 credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, section 4 requires the retail liquor store to
72 notify the wholesale dealer of the election. The retail liquor store is responsible for all
73 costs associated with processing the credit card transaction. Finally, section 4 requires,
74 at the time a wholesale dealer makes a delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to a retail
75 liquor store: (1) the wholesale dealer and retail liquor store to review the invoice of the

Assembly Amendment No. 859 to Assembly Bill No. 404 First Reprint Page 5
76 delivery for accuracy; and (2) if the invoice is accurate, the retail liquor store to sign the
77 invoice to confirm the accuracy of the invoice.
