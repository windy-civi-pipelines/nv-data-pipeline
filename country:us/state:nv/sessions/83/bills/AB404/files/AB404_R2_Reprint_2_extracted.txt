Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State.
2 (NRS 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or
3 more brew pubs to sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off
4 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2)
5 manufactured and sealed in packages on the premises of any of the brew pubs for
6 consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 of this bill additionally
7 authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to sell at retail any other
8 alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has obtained any
9 license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in
10 which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a
11 licensed wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic
-
*AB404_R2*
– 2 –
12 beverages, including, without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the
13 premises of one or more of the brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than
14 two retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person if: (1) the
15 person has obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at
16 retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is located; (2) the
17 person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3) for a
18 retail liquor store location for which the person obtained any license or permit
19 required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail on or after January 1, 2025, the retail
20 liquor store location is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment;
21 and (4) the retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew
22 pub, with certain exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store
23 locations set forth in section 2, section 6 of this bill provides that a person who, on
24 March 31, 2025, holds a license to operate a brew pub and any license or permit to
25 operate three retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person is
26 authorized to engage in the activities authorized by section 2 at the third location so
27 long as the license for that location is not transferred to another person or location.
28 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
29 manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
30 person operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to
31 manufacture and sell 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
32 person operates in this State provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located
33 outside of this State. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell
34 the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a wholesaler located outside of this
35 State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to persons residing in states
36 outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who operates a brew pub
37 and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to comply with
38 certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
39 and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the
40 brew pub and each retail liquor store location.
41 Existing law provides for the licensure of persons engaged in various activities
42 relating to intoxicating liquor. (Chapter 369 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the
43 board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to
44 investigate complaints against a licensee, conduct hearings and recommend to the
45 Department of Taxation, under certain circumstances, the revocation or suspension
46 of a license. (NRS 369.230-369.290) Sections 3.1-3.6 of this bill, in general,
47 provide for the Department to also perform these functions in the same manner as a
48 board of county commissioners or governing body of a city and authorize the
49 Department to revoke or suspend a license without receiving a recommendation
50 from a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city.
51 Existing law authorizes the Department, under certain circumstances, to issue a
52 summary suspension of the license of a licensee if the Department finds that the
53 licensee is violating any of the provisions of existing law governing intoxicating
54 liquor. (NRS 369.280) Section 3.6 requires the Department, after issuing a
55 summary suspension, to hold a hearing and render a decision regarding whether to
56 issue a final order revoking or refusing to revoke the license of the licensee.
57 Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit
58 and all retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department
59 of Taxation and its agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors
60 purchased or received, specifying certain information relating to those purchases
61 and receipts. (NRS 369.520) Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such
62 recordkeeping requirements on all persons manufacturing liquor.
63 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor
64 store under certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery
65 of that liquor. (NRS 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) with certain exceptions,
66 requires payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of
-
*AB404_R2*
– 3 –
67 beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires
68 the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds transfer by initiating the
69 withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store; (3) requires the
70 electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the 30th
71 day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a
72 wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any
73 fees incurred by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Section
74 4 also authorizes a retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or
75 distilled spirits by credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, section 4 requires the
76 retail liquor store to notify the wholesale dealer of the election. The retail liquor
77 store is responsible for all costs associated with processing the credit card
78 transaction. Finally, section 4 requires, at the time a wholesale dealer makes a
79 delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to a retail liquor store: (1) the wholesale
80 dealer and retail liquor store to review the invoice of the delivery for accuracy; and
81 (2) if the invoice is accurate, the retail liquor store to sign the invoice to confirm the
82 accuracy of the invoice.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to alcoholic beverages.
(BDR 52-651)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; authorizing a person who
operates a brew pub to engage in certain activities
concerning the sale of alcoholic beverages; revising
provisions governing the conduct of certain investigations
and hearings and the revocation and suspension of certain
licenses relating to intoxicating liquor; revising the
manner in which a payment from a retail liquor store to a
wholesale dealer for delivery of certain alcoholic
beverages must be made; requiring certain persons
manufacturing liquor to preserve certain records for
inspection and audit by the Department of Taxation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State.
2 (NRS 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or
3 more brew pubs to sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off
4 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2)
5 manufactured and sealed in packages on the premises of any of the brew pubs for
6 consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 of this bill additionally
7 authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to sell at retail any other
8 alcoholic beverages if the person who operates such a brew pub has obtained any
9 license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in
10 which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a
11 licensed wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to sell alcoholic
-
*AB404_R2*

– 2 –
12 beverages, including, without limitation, malt beverages manufactured on or off the
13 premises of one or more of the brew pubs at, with certain exceptions, not more than
14 two retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person if: (1) the
15 person has obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at
16 retail in the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is located; (2) the
17 person purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3) for a
18 retail liquor store location for which the person obtained any license or permit
19 required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail on or after January 1, 2025, the retail
20 liquor store location is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment;
21 and (4) the retail liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew
22 pub, with certain exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store
23 locations set forth in section 2, section 6 of this bill provides that a person who, on
24 March 31, 2025, holds a license to operate a brew pub and any license or permit to
25 operate three retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person is
26 authorized to engage in the activities authorized by section 2 at the third location so
27 long as the license for that location is not transferred to another person or location.
28 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
29 manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
30 person operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes the person to
31 manufacture and sell 20,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
32 person operates in this State provided such barrels are sold to a wholesaler located
33 outside of this State. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 instead authorizes the person to sell
34 the 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to a wholesaler located outside of this
35 State or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to persons residing in states
36 outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who operates a brew pub
37 and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations to comply with
38 certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the recordkeeping
39 and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with respect to the
40 brew pub and each retail liquor store location.
41 Existing law provides for the licensure of persons engaged in various activities
42 relating to intoxicating liquor. (Chapter 369 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the
43 board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to
44 investigate complaints against a licensee, conduct hearings and recommend to the
45 Department of Taxation, under certain circumstances, the revocation or suspension
46 of a license. (NRS 369.230-369.290) Sections 3.1-3.6 of this bill, in general,
47 provide for the Department to also perform these functions in the same manner as a
48 board of county commissioners or governing body of a city and authorize the
49 Department to revoke or suspend a license without receiving a recommendation
50 from a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city.
51 Existing law authorizes the Department, under certain circumstances, to issue a
52 summary suspension of the license of a licensee if the Department finds that the
53 licensee is violating any of the provisions of existing law governing intoxicating
54 liquor. (NRS 369.280) Section 3.6 requires the Department, after issuing a
55 summary suspension, to hold a hearing and render a decision regarding whether to
56 issue a final order revoking or refusing to revoke the license of the licensee.
57 Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit
58 and all retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department
59 of Taxation and its agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors
60 purchased or received, specifying certain information relating to those purchases
61 and receipts. (NRS 369.520) Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such
62 recordkeeping requirements on all persons manufacturing liquor.
63 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor
64 store under certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery
65 of that liquor. (NRS 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) with certain exceptions,
66 requires payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of
-
*AB404_R2*

– 3 –
67 beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires
68 the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds transfer by initiating the
69 withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store; (3) requires the
70 electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the 30th
71 day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a
72 wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any
73 fees incurred by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Section
74 4 also authorizes a retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or
75 distilled spirits by credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, section 4 requires the
76 retail liquor store to notify the wholesale dealer of the election. The retail liquor
77 store is responsible for all costs associated with processing the credit card
78 transaction. Finally, section 4 requires, at the time a wholesale dealer makes a
79 delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to a retail liquor store: (1) the wholesale
80 dealer and retail liquor store to review the invoice of the delivery for accuracy; and
81 (2) if the invoice is accurate, the retail liquor store to sign the invoice to confirm the
82 accuracy of the invoice.
