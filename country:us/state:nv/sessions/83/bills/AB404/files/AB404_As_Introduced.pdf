Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State.
2 (NRS 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or
3 more brew pubs to sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off
4 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2)
5 manufactured and sealed in packages on the premises of any of the brew pubs for
6 consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230) Section 2 of this bill additionally
7 authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to sell at retail malt
8 beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off the premises of any of the brew pubs
9 for consumption at not more than three other locations operated by the person; and
10 (2) manufactured on the premises of any of the brew pubs and which are sealed in
11 packages at not more than three other locations operated by the person for
12 consumption off the premises. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to transport
13 malt beverages to and store malt beverages at any other location operated by the
14 person for the purpose of conducting such sales.
15 Existing law authorizes a person who operates a brew pub to transport malt
16 beverages to a licensed retailer, other than a person who operates a brew pub, for

17 the purpose of selling the malt beverages at a special event in this State. (NRS
18 597.230) Section 2 authorizes a person who operates a brew pub to transport malt
19 beverages to another person who operates a brew pub for the purpose of selling the
20 malt beverages at a special event in this State.
21 Existing law defines a special event as an event that lasts not longer than 1
22 calendar day and occurs at a farmers’ market or at an event designated as a county
23 fair. (NRS 597.200) Section 1 of this bill revises that definition to instead define a
24 special event as an event that lasts not longer than 3 calendar days and for which a
25 permit has been issued by the local government where the event is conducted.
26 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from offering, keeping
27 or possessing for sale, furnishing or selling, or soliciting the purchase or sale of any
28 liquor in this State, or transporting or importing or causing to be transported or
29 imported any liquor in or into this State for delivery, storage, use or sale unless the
30 person complies with the relevant provisions of law, holds the appropriate license,
31 permit or certificate and meets certain other requirements. Existing law provides
32 certain exceptions from that prohibition, including, among others, for a person who
33 enters this State with 1 gallon or less of alcoholic beverage per month from another
34 state for his or her own household or personal use. (NRS 369.490) Section 3 of this
35 bill revises that exception to instead exempt a person who causes to be shipped in
36 or into this State 1 gallon or less of alcoholic beverage per month for his or her own
37 household or personal use.
