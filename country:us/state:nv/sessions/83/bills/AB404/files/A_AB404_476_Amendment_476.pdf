AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; [revising the definition of “special event”
for the purposes of certain provisions governing brew pubs;]
authorizing a person who operates a brew pub to engage in certain
activities concerning the [transport, storage and] sale of [malt]
alcoholic beverages; [revising provisions governing the possession,
sale and transportation of liquor;] requiring payment from a retail
liquor store to a wholesale dealer for delivery of certain alcoholic
beverages to be made by electronic funds transfer; requiring
certain persons manufacturing liquor to preserve certain records
for inspection and audit by the Department of Taxation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and operation of brew pubs in this State. (NRS
2 369.180, 597.230) Existing law authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to
3 sell at retail malt beverages that are: (1) manufactured on or off the premises of any of the
4 brew pubs for consumption on the premises; and (2) manufactured and sealed in packages on
5 the premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption off the premises. (NRS 597.230)
6 Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a person who operates one or more brew pubs to
7 sell at retail [malt] any other alcoholic beverages [that are: (1) manufactured on or off the
8 premises of any of the brew pubs for consumption at not more than three other locations
9 operated by the person; and (2) manufactured on the premises of any of the brew pubs and
10 which are sealed in packages at not more than three other locations operated by the person for
11 consumption off the premises.] if the person who operates such a brew pub has obtained
12 any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in the jurisdiction in
13 which the brew pub is located and purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed
14 wholesaler. Section 2 also authorizes such a person to [transport] sell alcoholic beverages,
15 including, without limitation, malt beverages [to and store malt beverages] manufactured
16 on or off the premises of one or more of the brew pubs at [any other location operated by
17 the person for the purpose of conducting such sales.] , with certain exceptions, not more

Assembly Amendment No. 476 to Assembly Bill No. 404 Page 4
18 than two retail liquor store locations under the common control of the person if: (1) the
19 person has obtained any license or permit required to sell alcoholic beverages at retail in
20 the jurisdiction in which the retail liquor store location is located; (2) the person
21 purchases all such alcoholic beverages from a licensed wholesaler; (3) the retail liquor
22 store is not located closer than 1,000 feet to a gaming establishment; and (4) the retail
23 liquor store location is located within the same county as the brew pub, with certain
24 exceptions. As an exception to the limit of two retail liquor store locations set forth in
25 section 2, section 6 provides that a person who, on March 31, 2025, holds a license to
26 operate a brew pub and any license or permit to operate three retail liquor store
27 locations under the common control of the person is authorized to engage in the
28 activities authorized by section 2 at the third location so long as the license for that
29 location is not transferred to another person or location.
30 Existing law : (1) prohibits a person who operates one or more brew pubs from
31 manufacturing more than 40,000 barrels of malt beverages for all the brew pubs the
32 person operates in this State in a calendar year; and (2) authorizes [a] the person [who
33 operates a brew pub] to [transport] manufacture and sell 20,000 barrels of malt beverages
34 for all the brew pubs the person operates in this State provided such barrels are sold to a
35 [licensed retailer, other than a person who operates a brew pub, for the purpose of selling the
36 malt beverages at a special event in] wholesaler located outside of this State. (NRS 597.230)
37 Section 2 instead authorizes [a] the person [who operates a brew pub] to [transport] sell the
38 20,000 barrels of malt beverages either to [another person who operates a brew pub for the
39 purpose of selling the malt beverages at a special event in] a wholesaler located outside of
40 this State [.
41 Existing law defines a special event as an event that lasts not longer than 1 calendar day
42 and occurs at a farmers’ market or at an event designated as a county fair. (NRS 597.200)
43 Section 1 of this bill revises that definition to instead define a special event as an event that
44 lasts not longer than 3 calendar days and for which a permit has been issued by the local
45 government where the event is conducted.
46 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from offering, keeping or
47 possessing for sale, furnishing or selling, or soliciting the purchase or sale of any liquor in this
48 State, or transporting or importing or causing to be transported or imported any liquor in or
49 into this State for delivery, storage, use or sale unless the person complies with the relevant
50 provisions of law, holds the appropriate license, permit or certificate and meets certain other
51 requirements. Existing law provides certain exceptions from that prohibition, including,
52 among others, for a person who enters this State with 1 gallon or less of alcoholic beverage
53 per month from another state for his or her own household or personal use. (NRS 369.490)
54 Section 3 of this bill revises that exception to instead exempt a person who causes to be
55 shipped in or into this State 1 gallon or less of alcoholic beverage per month for his or her
56 own household or personal use.] or, where allowable pursuant to applicable law, to
57 persons residing in states outside of this State. Finally, section 2 requires a person who
58 operates a brew pub and one or more commonly controlled retail liquor store locations
59 to comply with certain requirements of the Department of Taxation relating to the
60 recordkeeping and reporting of manufacturing, purchases and receipts of liquor with
61 respect to the brew pub and each retail liquor store location.
62 Existing law requires all persons obtaining liquor under any license or permit and
63 all retail liquor dealers to preserve for inspection and audit by the Department of
64 Taxation and its agents, for a period of 4 years, all invoices and lists of liquors purchased
65 or received, specifying certain information relating to those purchases and receipts.
66 (NRS 369.520) Section 5 of this bill additionally imposes such recordkeeping
67 requirements on all persons manufacturing liquor.
68 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor store
69 under certain circumstances relating to the timing of payments for the delivery of that
70 liquor. (NRS 369.485) Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires payment from a retail liquor
71 store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of beer, wine or distilled spirits to be made by
72 electronic funds transfer; (2) requires the wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds
73 transfer by initiating the withdrawal of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor
74 store; (3) requires the electronic funds transfer to be completed not later than the
75 expiration of the 30th day after the date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits;
76 and (4) prohibits a wholesale dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or

Assembly Amendment No. 476 to Assembly Bill No. 404 Page 5
77 indirectly, any fees incurred by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds
78 transfer.
