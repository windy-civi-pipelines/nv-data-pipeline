AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
submission of data and metrics on the performance and
progress of pupils; revising provisions governing the
automated system of accountability information for
Nevada; requiring the Commission on Innovation and
Excellence in Education to review and make
recommendations concerning reports on pupil

for such reports and collaborate with the Department of
Education to create a centralized repository of such
reports; revising requirements for publishing a list of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to: (1) establish
2 certain metrics of performance for public schools for each grade; and (2) on or
3 before October 1 of each year, report data relating to each metric to the Governor,
4 the State Board of Education and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
5 transmission to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education. (NRS
6 385A.080) In addition, existing law requires: (1) the Commission on School
-
*AB389_R1*
– 2 –
7 Funding to review the academic progress made by pupils in each public school
8 since the implementation of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan and use certain
9 metrics in performing that review; and (2) each school district and charter school to
10 submit to the Commission a quarterly report of data and metrics collected by the
11 school district or charter school to identify areas of improvement in academic
12 performance and the progress of pupils. (NRS 387.12463) Section 5 of this bill
13 removes the requirement for each school district and charter school to submit to the
14 Commission a quarterly report of such data and metrics and, instead, requires the
15 Commission to conduct an annual review of data and metrics to identify how
16 funding from the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan is being used to improve the
17 academic performance and progress of pupils. Under section 5: (1) the annual
18 review may include, without limitation, a review of data and metrics submitted to
19 the Commission by school districts and charter schools and data and metrics
20 previously reported to the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department
21 of Education; and (2) data and metrics previously reported by school districts and
22 charter schools to the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department are
23 not required to also be submitted to the Commission. Finally, section 1 of this bill
24 similarly requires that, to the greatest extent possible, the Superintendent of Public
25 Instruction use information previously submitted to the Superintendent or the
26 Department to prepare reports of data concerning metrics of performance for public
27 schools and to avoid duplicative requests for information.
28 Existing law requires the Department to establish and maintain an automated
29 system of accountability information for Nevada that has the capacity to provide
30 and report certain information concerning pupils in this State. (NRS 385A.800) To
31 carry out the automated system of accountability, the Superintendent of Public
32 Instruction is required to prescribe a uniform program throughout this State for the
33 collection, maintenance and transfer of data, which must include standardized
34 software, and each school district is required to adopt and maintain that uniform
35 program, including, without limitation, by providing electronic data concerning
36 pupils as required by the Superintendent. (NRS 385A.810, 385A.820) Sections 2
37 and 3 of this bill clarify that this uniform program must include the collection,
38 validation and maintenance of electronic records concerning pupils and the transfer
39 of data to the Department from electronic records maintained by each school
40 district, sponsor of a charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
41 pupils in this State. Section 3 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
42 deduct money from certain apportionments from the State Education Fund
43 otherwise owed to a school district, charter school or university school for
44 profoundly gifted pupils to compensate the Department for costs to collect, validate
45 and maintain electronic records concerning pupils and financial accountability
46 information as necessary to report on pupil achievement and financial
47 accountability on behalf of the school district, charter school or university school
48 for profoundly gifted pupils.
49 Existing law requires the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
50 Education to develop a statewide vision and implementation plan to improve the
51 public education system in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 4 of this bill
52 additionally requires the Commission to: (1) review the reporting, tracking,
53 monitoring, analyzing and dissemination of data relating to pupil achievement to
54 identify and recommend the elimination of reporting requirements that are
55 redundant or do not effectively provide measurable and informative data with
56 which to assess and improve educational programs and priorities in this State; and
57 (2) present any recommendations made by the Commission to the Joint Interim
58 Standing Committee on Education and annually transmit such recommendations to
59 the Governor and the Legislature. Section 4 also requires the Commission to: (1)
60 collaborate with the Department of Education to gather input on the reporting,
61 tracking, monitoring, analyzing and dissemination of data relating to pupil
-

62 achievement and financial accountability; (2) collaborate with the Department to
63 establish a centralized repository of all reports of data relating to pupil achievement
64 and financial accountability and make the repository easily accessible on the
65 Internet website of the Department; and (3) develop a framework for the reporting
66 of data relating to pupil achievement and financial accountability that ensures that
67 data reported to the Department identifies areas of proficiency and growth of pupils
68 in this State, identifies gaps in achievement among groups of pupils in this State
69 and provides clear, actionable data to enable the development of policies and
70 practices to improve educational outcomes in this State.
71 Section 6 this bill: (1) repeals the requirement for the board of trustees of a
72 county school district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school
73 district in a newspaper that meets certain requirements; and (2) instead requires the
74 board of trustees of a county school district to publish the quarterly expenditure
75 report on the Internet website of the county school district. (NRS 387.320)
76 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
77 from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
78 388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
79 to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
80 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
81 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
82 school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
83 year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
84 Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 7 of
85 this bill provides that: (1) the prohibition against exceeding the prescribed ratio of
86 pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes is measured for the entire school year
87 rather than each school quarter of a school year; and (2) a school district is required
88 to request a variance only if the ratio measured for one or more elementary schools
89 for the entire school year exceeds the prescribed ratio. Section 9 of this bill requires
90 annual reports, rather than quarterly reports, regarding the average daily enrollment
91 of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels.
92 Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove references to such
93 quarterly reports.
94 Existing law requires the governing body of each local government to: (1)
95 submit a fiscal report of the local government to the Department of Taxation in
96 accordance with the requirements prescribed by the Committee on Local
97 Government Finance; and (2) publish a summary of the fiscal report in a newspaper
98 that meets certain requirements. Under existing regulations, the summary of the
99 fiscal report published in a newspaper is: (1) required to contain certain information
100 concerning the revenues and expenditures of the general fund of the local
101 government and any proprietary fund of the local government; and (2) authorized to
102 contain such information for any other fund of the local government. Section 10 of
103 this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of a county school
104 district to prepare and publish a summary of the fiscal report of the county school
105 district.
106 Section 11 of this bill repeals the requirement for the Department, in
107 consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal
108 Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, to: (1) recommend a
109 minimum amount of money to be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on
110 textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware
111 by school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted
112 pupils; and (2) publish a report concerning school districts, charter schools and
113 university schools for profoundly gifted pupils that did not spend the recommended
114 minimum amount. (NRS 387.206, 387.2062)

software and instructional hardware.

Section 3:
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the
Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office
of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative
Counsel Bureau, shall determine a recommended minimum amount
of money to be expended during each fiscal year of a biennium for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and
university schools for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be
determined by increasing the amount that was established for the
Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the change in
enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for
which the amount is being established, plus any inflationary
adjustment approved by the Legislature after Fiscal Year
2004-2005.

Section 4:
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of
the Office of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall develop or revise, as applicable, a
formula for determining the minimum amount of money that each
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware. The sum of all of the minimum amounts
determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1.
The formula must be used only to develop expenditure
recommendations and must not be used to alter the yearly
apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.

Section 5:
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the
Department shall provide written notice to each school district,
charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils on
or before August 15 of each odd-numbered year that sets forth the
recommended minimum combined amount of money that the school
district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
pupils may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies,
-
*AB389_R1*
– 18 –
instructional software and instructional hardware for each fiscal year
of a biennium.

Section 6:
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with
recommended minimum expenditure.

Section 7:
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall
determine whether each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils has expended, during the
immediately preceding fiscal year, the recommended minimum
amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the
Department shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant
to NRS 388C.250.

Section 8:
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the
Department determines that a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, has not
expended the recommended minimum amount of money set forth in
the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report
on an Internet website maintained by the Department which
identifies the difference between the actual combined expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware and the minimum recommended combined
expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 387.206.

Section 9:
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter
school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than
the enrollment included in the projections used in the biennial
budget of the school district submitted pursuant to NRS 387.303, the
budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS 388A.345
or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the
recommended expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware pursuant to NRS

Section 10:
387.206 must be reduced proportionately.

for such reports and collaborate with the Department of
Education to create a centralized repository of such
reports; revising requirements for publishing a list of
expenditures of county school districts; revising
provisions governing the ratios of pupils to licensed
teachers; removing the requirement for a school district to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to: (1) establish
2 certain metrics of performance for public schools for each grade; and (2) on or
3 before October 1 of each year, report data relating to each metric to the Governor,
4 the State Board of Education and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
5 transmission to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education. (NRS
6 385A.080) In addition, existing law requires: (1) the Commission on School
-
*AB389_R1*

– 2 –
7 Funding to review the academic progress made by pupils in each public school
8 since the implementation of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan and use certain
9 metrics in performing that review; and (2) each school district and charter school to
10 submit to the Commission a quarterly report of data and metrics collected by the
11 school district or charter school to identify areas of improvement in academic
12 performance and the progress of pupils. (NRS 387.12463) Section 5 of this bill
13 removes the requirement for each school district and charter school to submit to the
14 Commission a quarterly report of such data and metrics and, instead, requires the
15 Commission to conduct an annual review of data and metrics to identify how
16 funding from the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan is being used to improve the
17 academic performance and progress of pupils. Under section 5: (1) the annual
18 review may include, without limitation, a review of data and metrics submitted to
19 the Commission by school districts and charter schools and data and metrics
20 previously reported to the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department
21 of Education; and (2) data and metrics previously reported by school districts and
22 charter schools to the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department are
23 not required to also be submitted to the Commission. Finally, section 1 of this bill
24 similarly requires that, to the greatest extent possible, the Superintendent of Public
25 Instruction use information previously submitted to the Superintendent or the
26 Department to prepare reports of data concerning metrics of performance for public
27 schools and to avoid duplicative requests for information.
28 Existing law requires the Department to establish and maintain an automated
29 system of accountability information for Nevada that has the capacity to provide
30 and report certain information concerning pupils in this State. (NRS 385A.800) To
31 carry out the automated system of accountability, the Superintendent of Public
32 Instruction is required to prescribe a uniform program throughout this State for the
33 collection, maintenance and transfer of data, which must include standardized
34 software, and each school district is required to adopt and maintain that uniform
35 program, including, without limitation, by providing electronic data concerning
36 pupils as required by the Superintendent. (NRS 385A.810, 385A.820) Sections 2
37 and 3 of this bill clarify that this uniform program must include the collection,
38 validation and maintenance of electronic records concerning pupils and the transfer
39 of data to the Department from electronic records maintained by each school
40 district, sponsor of a charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
41 pupils in this State. Section 3 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
42 deduct money from certain apportionments from the State Education Fund
43 otherwise owed to a school district, charter school or university school for
44 profoundly gifted pupils to compensate the Department for costs to collect, validate
45 and maintain electronic records concerning pupils and financial accountability
46 information as necessary to report on pupil achievement and financial
47 accountability on behalf of the school district, charter school or university school
48 for profoundly gifted pupils.
49 Existing law requires the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
50 Education to develop a statewide vision and implementation plan to improve the
51 public education system in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 4 of this bill
52 additionally requires the Commission to: (1) review the reporting, tracking,
53 monitoring, analyzing and dissemination of data relating to pupil achievement to
54 identify and recommend the elimination of reporting requirements that are
55 redundant or do not effectively provide measurable and informative data with
56 which to assess and improve educational programs and priorities in this State; and
57 (2) present any recommendations made by the Commission to the Joint Interim
58 Standing Committee on Education and annually transmit such recommendations to
59 the Governor and the Legislature. Section 4 also requires the Commission to: (1)
60 collaborate with the Department of Education to gather input on the reporting,
61 tracking, monitoring, analyzing and dissemination of data relating to pupil
-
*AB389_R1*

– 3 –
62 achievement and financial accountability; (2) collaborate with the Department to
63 establish a centralized repository of all reports of data relating to pupil achievement
64 and financial accountability and make the repository easily accessible on the
65 Internet website of the Department; and (3) develop a framework for the reporting
66 of data relating to pupil achievement and financial accountability that ensures that
67 data reported to the Department identifies areas of proficiency and growth of pupils
68 in this State, identifies gaps in achievement among groups of pupils in this State
69 and provides clear, actionable data to enable the development of policies and
70 practices to improve educational outcomes in this State.
71 Section 6 this bill: (1) repeals the requirement for the board of trustees of a
72 county school district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school
73 district in a newspaper that meets certain requirements; and (2) instead requires the
74 board of trustees of a county school district to publish the quarterly expenditure
75 report on the Internet website of the county school district. (NRS 387.320)
76 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
77 from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
78 388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
79 to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
80 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
81 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
82 school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
83 year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
84 Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 7 of
85 this bill provides that: (1) the prohibition against exceeding the prescribed ratio of
86 pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes is measured for the entire school year
87 rather than each school quarter of a school year; and (2) a school district is required
88 to request a variance only if the ratio measured for one or more elementary schools
89 for the entire school year exceeds the prescribed ratio. Section 9 of this bill requires
90 annual reports, rather than quarterly reports, regarding the average daily enrollment
91 of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels.
92 Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove references to such
93 quarterly reports.
94 Existing law requires the governing body of each local government to: (1)
95 submit a fiscal report of the local government to the Department of Taxation in
96 accordance with the requirements prescribed by the Committee on Local
97 Government Finance; and (2) publish a summary of the fiscal report in a newspaper
98 that meets certain requirements. Under existing regulations, the summary of the
99 fiscal report published in a newspaper is: (1) required to contain certain information
100 concerning the revenues and expenditures of the general fund of the local
101 government and any proprietary fund of the local government; and (2) authorized to
102 contain such information for any other fund of the local government. Section 10 of
103 this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of a county school
104 district to prepare and publish a summary of the fiscal report of the county school
105 district.
106 Section 11 of this bill repeals the requirement for the Department, in
107 consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal
108 Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, to: (1) recommend a
109 minimum amount of money to be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on
110 textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware
111 by school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted
112 pupils; and (2) publish a report concerning school districts, charter schools and
113 university schools for profoundly gifted pupils that did not spend the recommended
114 minimum amount. (NRS 387.206, 387.2062)

8 reduction of pupil-teacher ratios.
9 5. The State Board shall, on [a quarterly] an annual basis,
10 submit a report to the Interim Finance Committee on each variance

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school
districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly
gifted pupils for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional
software and instructional hardware.
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the
Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office
of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative
Counsel Bureau, shall determine a recommended minimum amount
of money to be expended during each fiscal year of a biennium for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and
university schools for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be
determined by increasing the amount that was established for the
Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the change in
enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for
which the amount is being established, plus any inflationary
adjustment approved by the Legislature after Fiscal Year
2004-2005.
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of
the Office of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall develop or revise, as applicable, a
formula for determining the minimum amount of money that each
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware. The sum of all of the minimum amounts
determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1.
The formula must be used only to develop expenditure
recommendations and must not be used to alter the yearly
apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the
Department shall provide written notice to each school district,
charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils on
or before August 15 of each odd-numbered year that sets forth the
recommended minimum combined amount of money that the school
district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
pupils may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies,
-
*AB389_R1*

– 18 –
instructional software and instructional hardware for each fiscal year
of a biennium.
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with
recommended minimum expenditure.
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall
determine whether each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils has expended, during the
immediately preceding fiscal year, the recommended minimum
amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the
Department shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant
to NRS 388C.250.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the
Department determines that a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, has not
expended the recommended minimum amount of money set forth in
the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report
on an Internet website maintained by the Department which
identifies the difference between the actual combined expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware and the minimum recommended combined
expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 387.206.
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter
school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than
the enrollment included in the projections used in the biennial
budget of the school district submitted pursuant to NRS 387.303, the
budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS 388A.345
or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the
recommended expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware pursuant to NRS
387.206 must be reduced proportionately.
