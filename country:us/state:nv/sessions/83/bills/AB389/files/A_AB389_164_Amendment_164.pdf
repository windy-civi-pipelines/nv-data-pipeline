AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the submission of
data and metrics on the performance and progress of pupils; revising
provisions governing the automated system of accountability
information for Nevada; requiring the Commission on [School
Funding] Innovation and Excellence in Education to review and
make recommendations concerning reports on pupil achievement and
the financial accountability of school districts; requiring the
Commission to create a framework for such reports and collaborate
with the Department of Education to create a centralized repository of
such reports; revising requirements for publishing a list of expenditures
of county school districts; revising provisions governing the ratios of
pupils to licensed teachers; removing the requirement for a school
district to prepare a summary of certain fiscal reports; repealing the
requirement for the Department to recommend a minimum amount to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to: (1) establish certain
2 metrics of performance for public schools for each grade; and (2) on or before October 1 of
3 each year, report data relating to each metric to the Governor, the State Board of Education
4 and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Joint Interim
5 Standing Committee on Education. (NRS 385A.080) In addition, existing law requires: (1) the
6 Commission on School Funding to review the academic progress made by pupils in each
7 public school since the implementation of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan and use certain
8 metrics in performing that review; and (2) each school district and charter school to submit to
9 the Commission a quarterly report of data and metrics collected by the school district or
10 charter school to identify areas of improvement in academic performance and the progress of
11 pupils. (NRS 387.12463) Section 5 of this bill removes the requirement for each school
12 district and charter school to submit to the Commission a quarterly report of such data and
13 metrics and, instead, requires the Commission to conduct an annual review of data and metrics
14 to identify how funding from the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan is being used to improve the
15 academic performance and progress of pupils. Under section 5: (1) the annual review may
16 include, without limitation, a review of data and metrics submitted to the Commission by

Assembly Amendment No. 164 to Assembly Bill No. 389 Page 4
17 school districts and charter schools and data and metrics previously reported to the
18 Superintendent of Public Instruction or the Department of Education; and (2) data and metrics
19 previously reported by school districts and charter schools to the Superintendent of Public
20 Instruction or the Department are not required to also be submitted to the Commission.
21 Finally, section 1 of this bill similarly requires that, to the greatest extent possible, the
22 Superintendent of Public Instruction use information previously submitted to the
23 Superintendent or the Department to prepare reports of data concerning metrics of
24 performance for public schools and to avoid duplicative requests for information.
25 Existing law requires the Department to establish and maintain an automated system of
26 accountability information for Nevada that has the capacity to provide and report certain
27 information concerning pupils in this State. (NRS 385A.800) To carry out the automated
28 system of accountability, the Superintendent of Public Instruction is required to prescribe a
29 uniform program throughout this State for the collection, maintenance and transfer of data,
30 which must include standardized software, and each school district is required to adopt and
31 maintain that uniform program, including, without limitation, by providing electronic data
32 concerning pupils as required by the Superintendent. (NRS 385A.810, 385A.820) Sections 2
33 and 3 of this bill clarify that this uniform program must include the collection, validation and
34 maintenance of electronic records concerning pupils and the transfer of data to the Department
35 from electronic records maintained by each school district, sponsor of a charter school and
36 university school for profoundly gifted pupils in this State. Section 3 authorizes the
37 Superintendent of Public Instruction to deduct money from certain apportionments
38 from the State Education Fund otherwise owed to a school district, charter school or
39 university school for profoundly gifted pupils to compensate the Department for costs to
40 collect, validate and maintain electronic records concerning pupils and financial
41 accountability information as necessary to report on pupil achievement and financial
42 accountability on behalf of the school district, charter school or university school for
43 profoundly gifted pupils.
44 Existing law requires the Commission on [School Funding to review the academic
45 progress made by pupils in each public school since the implementation of the Pupil-Centered
46 Funding Plan and make recommendations to the Department, school districts and charter
47 schools to improve the reporting, tracking, monitoring, analyzing and dissemination of data
48 relating to pupil achievement and financial accountability.] Innovation and Excellence in
49 Education to develop a statewide vision and implementation plan to improve the public
50 education system in this State. (NRS [387.12463)] 385.920) Section 4 of this bill
51 additionally requires the Commission to: (1) review the reporting, tracking, monitoring,
52 analyzing and dissemination of data relating to pupil achievement to identify and recommend
53 the elimination of reporting requirements that are redundant or do not effectively provide
54 [meaningful information] measurable and informative data with which to assess and
55 [develop] improve educational programs and priorities in this State; and (2) [include in the]
56 present any recommendations made by the Commission to the [Governor and the Legislature
57 under existing law recommendations for the elimination of such reporting requirements or the
58 amending of reporting requirements to enhance the effectiveness and alignment of the
59 reporting with the educational programs and priorities of this State. (NRS 387.12463)] Joint
60 Interim Standing Committee on Education and annually transmit such
61 recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature. Section 4 also requires the
62 Commission to: (1) collaborate with the Department of Education to gather input on the
63 reporting, tracking, monitoring, analyzing and dissemination of data relating to pupil
64 achievement and financial accountability; (2) collaborate with the Department to
65 establish a centralized repository of all reports of data relating to pupil achievement and
66 financial accountability and make the repository easily accessible on the Internet website of
67 the Department; and [(2)] (3) develop a framework for the reporting of data relating to pupil
68 achievement and financial accountability that ensures that data reported to the Department
69 identifies areas of proficiency and growth of pupils in this State, identifies gaps in
70 achievement among groups of pupils in this State and provides clear, actionable data to enable
71 the development of policies and practices to improve educational outcomes in this State.
72 Section 6 this bill: (1) repeals the requirement for the board of trustees of a county school
73 district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that
74 meets certain requirements; and (2) instead requires the board of trustees of a county school

Assembly Amendment No. 164 to Assembly Bill No. 389 Page 5
75 district to publish the quarterly expenditure report on the Internet website of the county school
76 district. (NRS 387.320)
77 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
78 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
79 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
80 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
81 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
82 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
83 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
84 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
85 Section 7 of this bill provides that: (1) the prohibition against exceeding the prescribed ratio
86 of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes is measured for the entire school year rather
87 than each school quarter of a school year; and (2) a school district is required to request a
88 variance only if the ratio measured for one or more elementary schools for the entire school
89 year exceeds the prescribed ratio. Section 9 of this bill requires annual reports, rather than
90 quarterly reports, regarding the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per
91 licensed teacher for certain grade levels. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to
92 remove references to such quarterly reports.
93 Existing law requires the governing body of each local government to: (1) submit a fiscal
94 report of the local government to the Department of Taxation in accordance with the
95 requirements prescribed by the Committee on Local Government Finance; and (2) publish a
96 summary of the fiscal report in a newspaper that meets certain requirements. Under existing
97 regulations, the summary of the fiscal report published in a newspaper is: (1) required to
98 contain certain information concerning the revenues and expenditures of the general fund of
99 the local government and any proprietary fund of the local government; and (2) authorized to
100 contain such information for any other fund of the local government. Section 10 of this bill
101 eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of a county school district to prepare and
102 publish a summary of the fiscal report of the county school district.
103 Section 11 of this bill repeals the requirement for the Department, in consultation with
104 the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the
105 Legislative Counsel Bureau, to: (1) recommend a minimum amount of money to be spent
106 during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional
107 software and instructional hardware by school districts, charter schools and university schools
108 for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report concerning school districts, charter
109 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils that did not spend the
110 recommended minimum amount. (NRS 387.206, 387.2062)

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school districts, charter
schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils for textbooks,
instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware.
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the Department, in
consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal
Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall determine a
recommended minimum amount of money to be expended during each fiscal year
of a biennium for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be determined by increasing the
amount that was established for the Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the
change in enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for which
the amount is being established, plus any inflationary adjustment approved by the
Legislature after Fiscal Year 2004-2005.
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of
Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall
develop or revise, as applicable, a formula for determining the minimum amount of
money that each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for textbooks, instructional
supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware. The sum of all of the
minimum amounts determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. The formula
must be used only to develop expenditure recommendations and must not be used
to alter the yearly apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the Department
shall provide written notice to each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils on or before August 15 of each odd-numbered
year that sets forth the recommended minimum combined amount of money that the
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils
may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware for each fiscal year of a biennium.
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with recommended
minimum expenditure.
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall determine
whether each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils has expended, during the immediately preceding fiscal year, the
recommended minimum amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the Department
shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS
388C.250.

Assembly Amendment No. 164 to Assembly Bill No. 389 Page 16
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the Department determines
that a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
pupils, as applicable, has not expended the recommended minimum amount of
money set forth in the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report on an
Internet website maintained by the Department which identifies the difference
between the actual combined expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware and the minimum recommended
combined expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3 of
NRS 387.206.
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than the enrollment included in
the projections used in the biennial budget of the school district submitted pursuant
to NRS 387.303, the budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS
388A.345 or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the recommended expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional
hardware pursuant to NRS 387.206 must be reduced proportionately.
