EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing various requirements
relating to providers of vision insurance and providers of
vision care; revising provisions relating to certain
contracts between a provider of vision insurance and a
provider of vision care; prohibiting certain conduct of a
provider of vision insurance or provider of vision care
which would constitute an unfair or deceptive trade
practice in the business of insurance; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices in the business of
2 insurance. (NRS 686A.010-686A.310) Existing law prohibits an insurer from
3 entering into a contract with a provider of vision care that conditions any rate of
4 reimbursement for vision care on the provider of vision care prescribing certain
5 ophthalmic devices or materials or increases the rate of reimbursement if the
6 provider of vision care prescribes such ophthalmic devices or materials. Existing
7 law also prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a provider of vision
8 care that: (1) authorizes the insurer to set or limit the amount that the provider of
9 vision care may charge for vision care that is not reimbursed under the contract; or
10 (2) requires the provider of vision care to use a specific laboratory as the
11 manufacturer of ophthalmic devices or materials provided to a covered person.
12 Finally, existing law requires a provider of vision care to disclose to any covered
13 person an ownership or pecuniary interest of the provider in a supplier of
14 ophthalmic devices or materials before the covered person authorizes the provider
15 to obtain covered eyewear materials from such a supplier. (NRS 686A.135)
16 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to investigate a violation of
-

– 2 –
17 and enforce those provisions as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. (NRS
18 686A.020, 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.183)
19 Sections 2, 5-7, 9, 11, 13.5, 14, 16, 17, 28, 30, 34.5 and 37 of this bill revise
20 provisions of existing law governing vision care and set forth various definitions,
21 additional requirements and restrictions governing providers of vision insurance.
22 Section 13.5 defines “provider of vision insurance” to mean a person, including,
23 without limitation, an insurer, who creates, promotes, sells, provides, operates,
24 advertises or administers a vision benefit plan or vision benefit discount plan.
25 Section 16 defines “vision benefit plan” to mean a policy, contract, certificate or
26 agreement offered by a provider of vision insurance to provide for, deliver payment
27 for, arrange for the payment of, pay for or reimburse any of the costs of vision care.
28 Section 16 specifies that the term includes a standalone vision benefit plan or a
29 health benefit plan that provides coverage for vision care. Section 14 defines
30 “vision benefit discount plan” to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement
31 offered by a provider of vision insurance to an enrollee that solely provides for a
32 discount for covered services or covered materials.
33 Because an insurer that provides a vision benefit plan constitutes a provider of
34 vision insurance, section 37 revises the provisions of existing law setting forth
35 certain prohibitions on insurers with respect to vision care to replace references to
36 an insurer with references to a provider of vision insurance.
37 Section 30 prohibits a provider of vision insurance that offers more than one
38 vision benefit plan or vision benefit discount plan from conditioning the
39 participation of a provider of vision care in one plan on his or her participation in
40 any of the other plans of the provider of vision insurance.
41 Section 34.5 provides that a vision benefit plan, a vision benefit discount plan
42 or a contract between a provider of vision insurance and a provider of vision care
43 that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, has the
44 legal effect of including the provisions required by sections 2-34.5 and 37.
45 Section 28 prohibits certain actions of a provider of vision insurance relating to
46 certain business practices and billing practices.
47 Sections 35, 36 and 38-43 of this bill make provisions of existing law which
48 are generally applicable to certain unfair or deceptive trade practices in the business
49 of insurance specifically applicable to the provisions of sections 2-34.5. Sections
50 43.5-47 of this bill provide that certain entities that provide coverage for vision
51 care, including local governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, are
52 subject to the provisions of sections 2-34.5.

4 Sec. 44. NRS 695C.300 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 695C.300 1. No health maintenance organization or
6 representative thereof may cause or knowingly permit the use of
7 advertising which is untrue or misleading, solicitation which is
8 untrue or misleading or any form of evidence of coverage which is
9 deceptive. For purposes of this chapter:
10 (a) A statement or item of information shall be deemed to be
11 untrue if it does not conform to fact in any respect which is or may
12 be significant to an enrollee of, or person considering enrollment in,
13 a health care plan.
14 (b) A statement or item of information shall be deemed to be
15 misleading, whether or not it may be literally untrue if, in the total
16 context in which such statement is made or such item of information
17 is communicated, such statement or item of information may be
18 reasonably understood by a reasonable person not possessing special
19 knowledge regarding health care coverage, as indicating any benefit
20 or advantage or the absence of any exclusion, limitation or
21 disadvantage of possible significance to an enrollee of, or person
22 considering enrollment in, a health care plan if such benefit or
23 advantage or absence of limitation, exclusion or disadvantage does
24 not in fact exist.
25 (c) An evidence of coverage shall be deemed to be deceptive if
26 the evidence of coverage taken as a whole, and with consideration
27 given to typography and format as well as language, shall be such as
28 to cause a reasonable person not possessing special knowledge
29 regarding health care plans and evidences of coverage therefor to
30 expect benefits, services, charges or other advantages which the
31 evidence of coverage does not provide or which the health care plan
32 issuing such evidence of coverage does not regularly make available
33 for enrollees covered under such evidence of coverage.
34 2. NRS 686A.010 to 686A.310, inclusive, and sections 2 to
35 34.5, inclusive, of this act shall be construed to apply to health
36 maintenance organizations, health care plans and evidences of
37 coverage except to the extent that the nature of health maintenance
38 organizations, health care plans and evidences of coverage render
39 the sections therein clearly inappropriate.
40 3. An enrollee may not be cancelled or not renewed except for
41 the failure to pay the charge for such coverage or for cause as
42 determined in the master contract.
43 4. No health maintenance organization, unless licensed as an
44 insurer, may use in its name, contracts, or literature any of the words
45 “insurance,” “casualty,” “surety,” “mutual” or any other words
-

1 descriptive of the insurance, casualty or surety business or
2 deceptively similar to the name or description of any insurance or
