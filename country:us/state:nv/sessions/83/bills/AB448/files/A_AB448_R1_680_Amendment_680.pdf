EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing various requirements relating to
providers of vision [benefit managers] insurance and providers of
vision care; revising provisions relating to certain contracts between
[an insurer] a provider of vision insurance and a provider of vision
care; prohibiting certain conduct of a provider of vision [benefit
manager] insurance or provider of vision care which would constitute
an unfair or deceptive trade practice in the business of insurance;
[authorizing a provider of vision care to bring a civil action against a
vision benefit manager under certain circumstances;] and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices in the business of insurance. (NRS
2 686A.010-686A.310) Existing law prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a
3 provider of vision care that conditions any rate of reimbursement for vision care on the
4 provider of vision care prescribing certain ophthalmic devices or materials or increases the
5 rate of reimbursement if the provider of vision care prescribes such ophthalmic devices or
6 materials. Existing law also prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a provider
7 of vision care that: (1) authorizes the insurer to set or limit the amount that the provider of
8 vision care may charge for vision care that is not reimbursed under the contract; or (2)
9 requires the provider of vision care to use a specific laboratory as the manufacturer of
10 ophthalmic devices or materials provided to a covered person. Finally, existing law requires a
11 provider of vision care to disclose to any covered person an ownership or pecuniary interest of
12 the provider in a supplier of ophthalmic devices or materials before the covered person
13 authorizes the provider to obtain covered eyewear materials from such a supplier. (NRS
14 686A.135) Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to investigate a violation
15 of and enforce those provisions as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. (NRS 686A.020,
16 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.183)
17 Sections 2 [-25, 27-34] , 5-7, 9, 11, 13.5, 14, 16, 17, 28, 30, 34.5 and 37 of this bill revise
18 provisions of existing law governing vision care and set forth various definitions, additional
19 requirements and restrictions governing providers of vision [benefit managers.] insurance.

31 Because an insurer that provides a vision benefit plan constitutes a provider of vision
32 [benefit manager,] insurance, section 37 revises the provisions of existing law setting forth

34 with references to a provider of vision [benefit manager. Section 37 additionally prohibits a
35 vision benefit manager from: (1) requiring a provider of vision care to use a specific source or
36 supplier for certain materials, including ophthalmic devices; and (2) paying reimbursement to
37 a provider of vision care which is not reasonable.
38 Section 18 prohibits a vision benefit manager from limiting the reimbursement or choice
39 of a provider of vision care for services or materials which are not covered by a plan. Sections
40 19, 20, 25 and] insurance.

42 prohibits a provider of vision [benefit manager and] insurance that offers more than one
43 vision benefit plan or vision benefit discount plan from conditioning the participation of
44 a provider of vision care [.] in one plan on his or her participation in any of the other
45 plans of the provider of vision insurance.
46 Section [21 prohibits a vision benefit manager from falsely representing the number of
47 participating providers of vision care or the benefits that compose a plan. Section 22 prohibits
48 a vision benefit manager from engaging in certain marketing or advertising activities. Section
49 23 prohibits a vision benefit manager from retroactively reversing a reimbursement to a
50 provider of vision care if the provider relied in good faith on certain information at the time of
51 service. Section 24 authorizes a provider of vision care to offer a cash price option for certain
52 services and materials under certain circumstances. Section 27 establishes procedures for
53 amending or terminating] 34.5 provides that a vision benefit plan, a vision benefit discount
54 plan or a contract between a provider of vision [benefit manager] insurance and a provider
55 of vision care [.

59 manager] insurance relating to certain business practices [,] and billing practices . [, audit
60 practices and receiving personal or confidential information of an enrollee. Section 34
61 authorizes a provider of vision care who is adversely affected by certain violations by a vision
62 benefit manager to bring a civil action to recover his or her actual damages, punitive damages
63 and other equitable relief. Section 33 makes the provisions of this bill which are applicable to
64 a vision benefit manager equally applicable to any affiliate or subcontractor that a vision
65 benefit manager uses or enters into a contract with for certain activities. Section 33
66 additionally makes the provisions of this bill which are applicable to contracts between a
67 provider of vision care and a vision benefit manager equally applicable to certain other
68 agreements.]
69 Sections 35, 36 and 38-43 of this bill make provisions of existing law which are
70 generally applicable to certain unfair or deceptive trade practices in the business of insurance
71 specifically applicable to the provisions of sections [2-25 and 27-34.] 2-34.5. Sections [44-
72 47] 43.5-47 of this bill provide that certain entities that provide coverage for vision care,
73 including local governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, are subject to the
74 provisions of sections [2 -25 and 27-34.] 2-34.5.
75 [Sections 3-17 define certain words and terms for the purposes of this bill.]
