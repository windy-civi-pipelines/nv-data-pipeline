EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing various requirements
relating to vision benefit managers and providers of vision
care; revising provisions relating to certain contracts
between an insurer and a provider of vision care;
prohibiting certain conduct of a vision benefit manager or
provider of vision care which would constitute an unfair
or deceptive trade practice in the business of insurance;
authorizing a provider of vision care to bring a civil action
against a vision benefit manager under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices in the business of
2 insurance. (NRS 686A.010-686A.310) Existing law prohibits an insurer from
3 entering into a contract with a provider of vision care that conditions any rate of
4 reimbursement for vision care on the provider of vision care prescribing certain
5 ophthalmic devices or materials or increases the rate of reimbursement if the
6 provider of vision care prescribes such ophthalmic devices or materials. Existing
7 law also prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a provider of vision
8 care that: (1) authorizes the insurer to set or limit the amount that the provider of
9 vision care may charge for vision care that is not reimbursed under the contract; or
10 (2) requires the provider of vision care to use a specific laboratory as the
11 manufacturer of ophthalmic devices or materials provided to a covered person.
12 Finally, existing law requires a provider of vision care to disclose to any covered
13 person an ownership or pecuniary interest of the provider in a supplier of
14 ophthalmic devices or materials before the covered person authorizes the provider
-
*AB448_R1*
– 2 –
15 to obtain covered eyewear materials from such a supplier. (NRS 686A.135)
16 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to investigate a violation of
17 and enforce those provisions as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. (NRS
18 686A.020, 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.183)
19 Sections 2-25, 27-34 and 37 of this bill revise provisions of existing law
20 governing vision care and set forth various additional requirements and restrictions
21 governing vision benefit managers. Section 15 defines “vision benefit manager” to
22 mean a person, including, without limitation, an insurer, third-party administrator
23 or subcontractor, that creates, promotes, sells, provides, operates, advertises or
24 administers a vision benefit plan or vision benefit discount plan. Section 16 defines
25 “vision benefit plan” to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement offered by
26 a vision benefit manager to provide for, deliver payment for, arrange for the
27 payment of, pay for or reimburse any of the costs of vision care. Section 16
28 specifies that the term includes a standalone vision benefit plan or a health benefit
29 plan that provides coverage for vision care. Section 14 defines “vision benefit
30 discount plan” to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement offered by a
31 vision benefit manager to an enrollee that solely provides for a discount for covered
32 services or covered materials.
33 Because an insurer that provides a vision benefit plan constitutes a vision
34 benefit manager, section 37 revises the provisions of existing law setting forth
35 certain prohibitions on insurers with respect to vision care to replace references to
36 an insurer with references to a vision benefit manager. Section 37 additionally
37 prohibits a vision benefit manager from: (1) requiring a provider of vision care to
38 use a specific source or supplier for certain materials, including ophthalmic
39 devices; and (2) paying reimbursement to a provider of vision care which is not
40 reasonable.
41 Section 18 prohibits a vision benefit manager from limiting the reimbursement
42 or choice of a provider of vision care for services or materials which are not
43 covered by a plan. Sections 19, 20, 25 and 30-32 prohibit certain provisions in a
44 contract or agreement between a vision benefit manager and a provider of vision
45 care.
46 Section 21 prohibits a vision benefit manager from falsely representing the
47 number of participating providers of vision care or the benefits that compose a plan.
48 Section 22 prohibits a vision benefit manager from engaging in certain marketing
49 or advertising activities. Section 23 prohibits a vision benefit manager from
50 retroactively reversing a reimbursement to a provider of vision care if the provider
51 relied in good faith on certain information at the time of service. Section 24
52 authorizes a provider of vision care to offer a cash price option for certain services
53 and materials under certain circumstances. Section 27 establishes procedures for
54 amending or terminating a contract between a vision benefit manager and a
55 provider of vision care.
56 Sections 28 and 29 prohibit certain actions of a vision benefit manager relating
57 to certain business practices, billing practices, audit practices and receiving
58 personal or confidential information of an enrollee. Section 34 authorizes a
59 provider of vision care who is adversely affected by certain violations by a vision
60 benefit manager to bring a civil action to recover his or her actual damages,
61 punitive damages and other equitable relief. Section 33 makes the provisions of this
62 bill which are applicable to a vision benefit manager equally applicable to any
63 affiliate or subcontractor that a vision benefit manager uses or enters into a contract
64 with for certain activities. Section 33 additionally makes the provisions of this bill
65 which are applicable to contracts between a provider of vision care and a vision
66 benefit manager equally applicable to certain other agreements.
67 Sections 35, 36 and 38-43 of this bill make provisions of existing law which
68 are generally applicable to certain unfair or deceptive trade practices in the business
69 of insurance specifically applicable to the provisions of sections 2-25 and 27-34.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 448
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 448–ASSEMBLYMEMBER KOENIG
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance for vision
care. (BDR 57-983)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 46)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing various requirements
relating to vision benefit managers and providers of vision
care; revising provisions relating to certain contracts
between an insurer and a provider of vision care;
prohibiting certain conduct of a vision benefit manager or
provider of vision care which would constitute an unfair
or deceptive trade practice in the business of insurance;
authorizing a provider of vision care to bring a civil action
against a vision benefit manager under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices in the business of
2 insurance. (NRS 686A.010-686A.310) Existing law prohibits an insurer from
3 entering into a contract with a provider of vision care that conditions any rate of
4 reimbursement for vision care on the provider of vision care prescribing certain
5 ophthalmic devices or materials or increases the rate of reimbursement if the
6 provider of vision care prescribes such ophthalmic devices or materials. Existing
7 law also prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a provider of vision
8 care that: (1) authorizes the insurer to set or limit the amount that the provider of
9 vision care may charge for vision care that is not reimbursed under the contract; or
10 (2) requires the provider of vision care to use a specific laboratory as the
11 manufacturer of ophthalmic devices or materials provided to a covered person.
12 Finally, existing law requires a provider of vision care to disclose to any covered
13 person an ownership or pecuniary interest of the provider in a supplier of
14 ophthalmic devices or materials before the covered person authorizes the provider
-
*AB448_R1*

– 2 –
15 to obtain covered eyewear materials from such a supplier. (NRS 686A.135)
16 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to investigate a violation of
17 and enforce those provisions as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. (NRS
18 686A.020, 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.183)
19 Sections 2-25, 27-34 and 37 of this bill revise provisions of existing law
20 governing vision care and set forth various additional requirements and restrictions
21 governing vision benefit managers. Section 15 defines “vision benefit manager” to
22 mean a person, including, without limitation, an insurer, third-party administrator
23 or subcontractor, that creates, promotes, sells, provides, operates, advertises or
24 administers a vision benefit plan or vision benefit discount plan. Section 16 defines
25 “vision benefit plan” to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement offered by
26 a vision benefit manager to provide for, deliver payment for, arrange for the
27 payment of, pay for or reimburse any of the costs of vision care. Section 16
28 specifies that the term includes a standalone vision benefit plan or a health benefit
29 plan that provides coverage for vision care. Section 14 defines “vision benefit
30 discount plan” to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement offered by a
31 vision benefit manager to an enrollee that solely provides for a discount for covered
32 services or covered materials.
33 Because an insurer that provides a vision benefit plan constitutes a vision
34 benefit manager, section 37 revises the provisions of existing law setting forth
35 certain prohibitions on insurers with respect to vision care to replace references to
36 an insurer with references to a vision benefit manager. Section 37 additionally
37 prohibits a vision benefit manager from: (1) requiring a provider of vision care to
38 use a specific source or supplier for certain materials, including ophthalmic
39 devices; and (2) paying reimbursement to a provider of vision care which is not
40 reasonable.
41 Section 18 prohibits a vision benefit manager from limiting the reimbursement
42 or choice of a provider of vision care for services or materials which are not
43 covered by a plan. Sections 19, 20, 25 and 30-32 prohibit certain provisions in a
44 contract or agreement between a vision benefit manager and a provider of vision
45 care.
46 Section 21 prohibits a vision benefit manager from falsely representing the
47 number of participating providers of vision care or the benefits that compose a plan.
48 Section 22 prohibits a vision benefit manager from engaging in certain marketing
49 or advertising activities. Section 23 prohibits a vision benefit manager from
50 retroactively reversing a reimbursement to a provider of vision care if the provider
51 relied in good faith on certain information at the time of service. Section 24
52 authorizes a provider of vision care to offer a cash price option for certain services
53 and materials under certain circumstances. Section 27 establishes procedures for
54 amending or terminating a contract between a vision benefit manager and a
55 provider of vision care.
56 Sections 28 and 29 prohibit certain actions of a vision benefit manager relating
57 to certain business practices, billing practices, audit practices and receiving
58 personal or confidential information of an enrollee. Section 34 authorizes a
59 provider of vision care who is adversely affected by certain violations by a vision
60 benefit manager to bring a civil action to recover his or her actual damages,
61 punitive damages and other equitable relief. Section 33 makes the provisions of this
62 bill which are applicable to a vision benefit manager equally applicable to any
63 affiliate or subcontractor that a vision benefit manager uses or enters into a contract
64 with for certain activities. Section 33 additionally makes the provisions of this bill
65 which are applicable to contracts between a provider of vision care and a vision
66 benefit manager equally applicable to certain other agreements.
67 Sections 35, 36 and 38-43 of this bill make provisions of existing law which
68 are generally applicable to certain unfair or deceptive trade practices in the business
69 of insurance specifically applicable to the provisions of sections 2-25 and 27-34.

70 Sections 44-47 of this bill provide that certain entities that provide coverage for
71 vision care, including local governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits

2 695C.300 1. No health maintenance organization or

4 advertising which is untrue or misleading, solicitation which is
5 untrue or misleading or any form of evidence of coverage which is
6 deceptive. For purposes of this chapter:
7 (a) A statement or item of information shall be deemed to be
8 untrue if it does not conform to fact in any respect which is or may
9 be significant to an enrollee of, or person considering enrollment in,
10 a health care plan.
11 (b) A statement or item of information shall be deemed to be
12 misleading, whether or not it may be literally untrue if, in the total
13 context in which such statement is made or such item of information
14 is communicated, such statement or item of information may be
15 reasonably understood by a reasonable person not possessing special
16 knowledge regarding health care coverage, as indicating any benefit
17 or advantage or the absence of any exclusion, limitation or
18 disadvantage of possible significance to an enrollee of, or person
19 considering enrollment in, a health care plan if such benefit or
20 advantage or absence of limitation, exclusion or disadvantage does
21 not in fact exist.
22 (c) An evidence of coverage shall be deemed to be deceptive if
23 the evidence of coverage taken as a whole, and with consideration
24 given to typography and format as well as language, shall be such as
25 to cause a reasonable person not possessing special knowledge
26 regarding health care plans and evidences of coverage therefor to
27 expect benefits, services, charges or other advantages which the
28 evidence of coverage does not provide or which the health care plan
29 issuing such evidence of coverage does not regularly make available
30 for enrollees covered under such evidence of coverage.
31 2. NRS 686A.010 to 686A.310, inclusive, and sections 2 to 34,

45 surety corporation doing business in this State.
