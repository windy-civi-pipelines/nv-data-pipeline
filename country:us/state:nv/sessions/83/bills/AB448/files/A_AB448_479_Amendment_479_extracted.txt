EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing various requirements relating to vision
benefit managers and providers of vision care; revising provisions
relating to certain contracts between an insurer and a provider of vision
care; prohibiting certain conduct of a vision benefit manager or
provider of vision care which would constitute an unfair or deceptive
trade practice in the business of insurance; authorizing a provider of
vision care to bring a civil action against a vision benefit manager
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices in the business of insurance. (NRS
2 686A.010-686A.310) Existing law prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a
3 provider of vision care that conditions any rate of reimbursement for vision care on the
4 provider of vision care prescribing certain ophthalmic devices or materials or increases the
5 rate of reimbursement if the provider of vision care prescribes such ophthalmic devices or
6 materials. Existing law also prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a provider
7 of vision care that: (1) authorizes the insurer to set or limit the amount that the provider of
8 vision care may charge for vision care that is not reimbursed under the contract; or (2)
9 requires the provider of vision care to use a specific laboratory as the manufacturer of
10 ophthalmic devices or materials provided to a covered person. Finally, existing law requires a
11 provider of vision care to disclose to any covered person an ownership or pecuniary interest of
12 the provider in a supplier of ophthalmic devices or materials before the covered person
13 authorizes the provider to obtain covered eyewear materials from such a supplier. (NRS
14 686A.135) Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to investigate a violation
15 of and enforce those provisions as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. (NRS 686A.020,
16 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.183)
17 Sections [2-34] 2-25, 27-34 and 37 of this bill revise provisions of existing law
18 governing vision care and set forth various additional requirements and restrictions governing
19 vision benefit managers. Section 15 defines “vision benefit manager” to mean a person,
20 including, without limitation, an insurer, third-party administrator or subcontractor, that
Assembly Amendment No. 479 to Assembly Bill No. 448 Page 4
21 creates, promotes, sells, provides, operates, advertises or administers a vision benefit plan or
22 vision benefit discount plan. Section 16 defines “vision benefit plan” to mean a policy,
23 contract, certificate or agreement offered by a vision benefit manager to provide for, deliver
24 payment for, arrange for the payment of, pay for or reimburse any of the costs of vision care.
25 Section 16 specifies that the term includes a standalone vision benefit plan or a health benefit
26 plan that provides coverage for vision care. Section 14 defines “vision benefit discount plan”
27 to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement offered by a vision benefit manager to an
28 enrollee that solely provides for a discount for covered services or covered materials.
29 Because an insurer that provides a vision benefit plan constitutes a vision benefit
30 manager, section 37 revises the provisions of existing law setting forth certain prohibitions on
31 insurers with respect to vision care to replace references to an insurer with references to a
32 vision benefit manager. Section 37 additionally prohibits a vision benefit manager from: (1)
33 requiring a provider of vision care to use a specific source or supplier for certain materials,
34 including ophthalmic devices; and (2) paying reimbursement to a provider of vision care
35 which is not reasonable . [and not substantially similar to rates for reimbursement under
36 Medicare.]
37 Section 18 prohibits a vision benefit manager from limiting the reimbursement or choice
38 of a provider of vision care for services or materials which are not covered by a plan. Sections
39 19, 20, 25 and 30-32 prohibit certain provisions in a contract or agreement between a vision
40 benefit manager and a provider of vision care.
41 Section 21 prohibits a vision benefit manager from falsely representing the number of
42 participating providers of vision care or the benefits that compose a plan. Section 22 prohibits
43 a vision benefit manager from engaging in certain marketing or advertising activities. Section
44 23 prohibits a vision benefit manager from retroactively reversing a reimbursement to a
45 provider of vision care if the provider relied in good faith on certain information at the time of
46 service. Section 24 authorizes a provider of vision care to offer a cash price option for certain
47 services and materials under certain circumstances. [Section 26 requires a vision benefit
48 manager, under certain circumstances, to provide the same reimbursement to an optometrist
49 for certain services or materials as if the services or materials were provided by a physician.]
50 Section 27 establishes procedures for amending or terminating a contract between a vision
51 benefit manager and a provider of vision care.
52 Sections 28 and 29 prohibit certain actions of a vision benefit manager relating to certain
53 business practices, billing practices, audit practices and receiving personal or confidential
54 information of an enrollee. Section 34 authorizes a provider of vision care who is adversely
55 affected by certain violations by a vision benefit manager to bring a civil action to recover his
56 or her actual damages, punitive damages and other equitable relief. Section 33 makes the
57 provisions of this bill which are applicable to a vision benefit manager equally applicable to
58 any affiliate or subcontractor that a vision benefit manager uses or enters into a contract with
59 for certain activities. Section 33 additionally makes the provisions of this bill which are
60 applicable to contracts between a provider of vision care and a vision benefit manager equally
61 applicable to certain other agreements.
62 Sections 35, 36 and 38-43 of this bill make provisions of existing law which are
63 generally applicable to certain unfair or deceptive trade practices in the business of insurance
64 specifically applicable to the provisions of sections [2-34.] 2-25 and 27-34. Sections 44-47 of
65 this bill provide that certain entities that provide coverage for vision care, including local
66 governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, are subject to the provisions of
67 sections [2-34.] 2-25 and 27-34.
68 Sections 3-17 define certain words and terms for the purposes of this bill.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing various requirements relating to vision
benefit managers and providers of vision care; revising provisions
relating to certain contracts between an insurer and a provider of vision
care; prohibiting certain conduct of a vision benefit manager or
provider of vision care which would constitute an unfair or deceptive
trade practice in the business of insurance; authorizing a provider of
vision care to bring a civil action against a vision benefit manager
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits certain unfair trade practices in the business of insurance. (NRS
2 686A.010-686A.310) Existing law prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a
3 provider of vision care that conditions any rate of reimbursement for vision care on the
4 provider of vision care prescribing certain ophthalmic devices or materials or increases the
5 rate of reimbursement if the provider of vision care prescribes such ophthalmic devices or
6 materials. Existing law also prohibits an insurer from entering into a contract with a provider
7 of vision care that: (1) authorizes the insurer to set or limit the amount that the provider of
8 vision care may charge for vision care that is not reimbursed under the contract; or (2)
9 requires the provider of vision care to use a specific laboratory as the manufacturer of
10 ophthalmic devices or materials provided to a covered person. Finally, existing law requires a
11 provider of vision care to disclose to any covered person an ownership or pecuniary interest of
12 the provider in a supplier of ophthalmic devices or materials before the covered person
13 authorizes the provider to obtain covered eyewear materials from such a supplier. (NRS
14 686A.135) Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to investigate a violation
15 of and enforce those provisions as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. (NRS 686A.020,
16 686A.160, 686A.170, 686A.183)
17 Sections [2-34] 2-25, 27-34 and 37 of this bill revise provisions of existing law
18 governing vision care and set forth various additional requirements and restrictions governing
19 vision benefit managers. Section 15 defines “vision benefit manager” to mean a person,
20 including, without limitation, an insurer, third-party administrator or subcontractor, that

Assembly Amendment No. 479 to Assembly Bill No. 448 Page 4
21 creates, promotes, sells, provides, operates, advertises or administers a vision benefit plan or
22 vision benefit discount plan. Section 16 defines “vision benefit plan” to mean a policy,
23 contract, certificate or agreement offered by a vision benefit manager to provide for, deliver
24 payment for, arrange for the payment of, pay for or reimburse any of the costs of vision care.
25 Section 16 specifies that the term includes a standalone vision benefit plan or a health benefit
26 plan that provides coverage for vision care. Section 14 defines “vision benefit discount plan”
27 to mean a policy, contract, certificate or agreement offered by a vision benefit manager to an
28 enrollee that solely provides for a discount for covered services or covered materials.
29 Because an insurer that provides a vision benefit plan constitutes a vision benefit
30 manager, section 37 revises the provisions of existing law setting forth certain prohibitions on
31 insurers with respect to vision care to replace references to an insurer with references to a
32 vision benefit manager. Section 37 additionally prohibits a vision benefit manager from: (1)
33 requiring a provider of vision care to use a specific source or supplier for certain materials,
34 including ophthalmic devices; and (2) paying reimbursement to a provider of vision care
35 which is not reasonable . [and not substantially similar to rates for reimbursement under
36 Medicare.]
37 Section 18 prohibits a vision benefit manager from limiting the reimbursement or choice
38 of a provider of vision care for services or materials which are not covered by a plan. Sections
39 19, 20, 25 and 30-32 prohibit certain provisions in a contract or agreement between a vision
40 benefit manager and a provider of vision care.
41 Section 21 prohibits a vision benefit manager from falsely representing the number of
42 participating providers of vision care or the benefits that compose a plan. Section 22 prohibits
43 a vision benefit manager from engaging in certain marketing or advertising activities. Section
44 23 prohibits a vision benefit manager from retroactively reversing a reimbursement to a
45 provider of vision care if the provider relied in good faith on certain information at the time of
46 service. Section 24 authorizes a provider of vision care to offer a cash price option for certain
47 services and materials under certain circumstances. [Section 26 requires a vision benefit
48 manager, under certain circumstances, to provide the same reimbursement to an optometrist
49 for certain services or materials as if the services or materials were provided by a physician.]
50 Section 27 establishes procedures for amending or terminating a contract between a vision
51 benefit manager and a provider of vision care.
52 Sections 28 and 29 prohibit certain actions of a vision benefit manager relating to certain
53 business practices, billing practices, audit practices and receiving personal or confidential
54 information of an enrollee. Section 34 authorizes a provider of vision care who is adversely
55 affected by certain violations by a vision benefit manager to bring a civil action to recover his
56 or her actual damages, punitive damages and other equitable relief. Section 33 makes the
57 provisions of this bill which are applicable to a vision benefit manager equally applicable to
58 any affiliate or subcontractor that a vision benefit manager uses or enters into a contract with
59 for certain activities. Section 33 additionally makes the provisions of this bill which are
60 applicable to contracts between a provider of vision care and a vision benefit manager equally
61 applicable to certain other agreements.
62 Sections 35, 36 and 38-43 of this bill make provisions of existing law which are
63 generally applicable to certain unfair or deceptive trade practices in the business of insurance
64 specifically applicable to the provisions of sections [2-34.] 2-25 and 27-34. Sections 44-47 of
65 this bill provide that certain entities that provide coverage for vision care, including local
66 governments and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, are subject to the provisions of
67 sections [2-34.] 2-25 and 27-34.
68 Sections 3-17 define certain words and terms for the purposes of this bill.

52 care plan if such benefit or advantage or absence of limitation, exclusion or
53 disadvantage does not in fact exist.

Assembly Amendment No. 479 to Assembly Bill No. 448 Page 16
1 (c) An evidence of coverage shall be deemed to be deceptive if the evidence of
2 coverage taken as a whole, and with consideration given to typography and format
3 as well as language, shall be such as to cause a reasonable person not possessing
4 special knowledge regarding health care plans and evidences of coverage therefor
5 to expect benefits, services, charges or other advantages which the evidence of
6 coverage does not provide or which the health care plan issuing such evidence of
7 coverage does not regularly make available for enrollees covered under such
8 evidence of coverage.
9 2. NRS 686A.010 to 686A.310, inclusive, and sections 2 to 34, inclusive, of
10 this act shall be construed to apply to health maintenance organizations, health care

9 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the insurance.
10 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance, or any
