AN ACT relating to purchasing; requiring certain public entities to post certain
information relating to purchasing on their Internet websites; [creating
the Nevada Diverse Business Advisory Council; prescribing the
powers and duties of the Council;] revising the duties of the
Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing; abolishing the
Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark County;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the purchasing of
2 supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments. (Chapter 332 of NRS) The
3 State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the Purchasing Division of the Department of
4 Administration, governs the purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by
5 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
6 (Chapter 333 of NRS) Sections [1] 1.2 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
7 government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
8 prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of supplies,
9 materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local government or for state
10 agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a person may request notice of
11 solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts for such purchases.
12 Existing law requires the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing to study
13 practices in governmental purchasing and laws relating thereto and make
14 recommendations with respect to those laws to the next regular session of the
15 Legislature. (NRS 332.215) Section 1.8 of this bill provides instead that the Commission
16 is required to: (1) review practices in governmental purchasing; and (2) make
17 recommendations to improve efficiency and equity in governmental purchasing
18 contracts.
19 Section 1.4 of this bill requires the Commission to: (1) recommend policies,
20 programs and procedures to encourage and promote purchasing from local businesses
Senate Amendment No. 516 to Senate Bill No. 71 Page 4
21 by local governments in this State; (2) create a supplier training program to educate
22 local businesses on the public procurement process; and (3) create a support and
23 outreach program that includes, without limitation, networking events and mentorship
24 opportunities for local businesses.
25 Section 1.6 of this bill requires each local government in a county that has a voting
26 member on the Commission to prepare and deliver an annual written report to the
27 Commission regarding their employees, purchasing expenditures and activities
28 undertaken relating to specified businesses during a fiscal year.
29 Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark
30 County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies, programs and procedures
31 to encourage and promote the use of local businesses owned and operated by disadvantaged
32 persons, particularly in the area of contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark
33 County. (Sections 15 and 20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at
34 pages 268 and 269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development
35 Advisory Council for Clark County . [, and sections 4-11 of this bill create the Nevada
36 Diverse Business Advisory Council, which has similar duties but a broader membership than
37 the former Council for Clark County. Section 8 prescribes the voting membership of the new
38 Council, including: (1) a representative of each county whose population is 100,000 or more
39 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties); (2) representatives from within each such county of
40 cities whose population is 7,000 or more (currently Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas,
41 Mesquite, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks), school districts, county fair and recreation
42 boards, law enforcement agencies, library districts, health districts, aviation agencies, regional
43 transportation commissions and water, wastewater and flood control agencies; (3)
44 representatives of associations of counties and cities; (4) representatives of institutions of the
45 Nevada System of Higher Education; and (5) the Administrator of the Purchasing Division.
46 Section 8 also authorizes the participation of other public and private entities as nonvoting
47 members. Sections 9 and 10 provide for the officers, meetings and expenses of the new
48 Council. Section 11: (1) sets forth the duties of the new Council, including recommending
49 policies, programs and procedures in the area of purchasing by public agencies to encourage
50 and promote the use of businesses primarily owned and operated by a person who is a member
51 of a racial or ethnic minority, female or a veteran or has a physical disability, or who identifies
52 as LGBTQ; and (2) requires the submission of certain biennial reports by member entities and
53 the Council.]
54 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the abolishment of the
55 Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark County and the [creation]
56 expansion of the [Nevada Diverse Business Advisory Council.] duties of the Commission to
57 Study Governmental Purchasing.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE [(§§ 10, 11)] ( § 1.6)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to purchasing; requiring certain public entities to post certain
information relating to purchasing on their Internet websites; [creating
the Nevada Diverse Business Advisory Council; prescribing the
powers and duties of the Council;] revising the duties of the
Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing; abolishing the
Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark County;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the purchasing of
2 supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments. (Chapter 332 of NRS) The
3 State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the Purchasing Division of the Department of
4 Administration, governs the purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by
5 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
6 (Chapter 333 of NRS) Sections [1] 1.2 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
7 government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
8 prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of supplies,
9 materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local government or for state
10 agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a person may request notice of
11 solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts for such purchases.
12 Existing law requires the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing to study
13 practices in governmental purchasing and laws relating thereto and make
14 recommendations with respect to those laws to the next regular session of the
15 Legislature. (NRS 332.215) Section 1.8 of this bill provides instead that the Commission
16 is required to: (1) review practices in governmental purchasing; and (2) make
17 recommendations to improve efficiency and equity in governmental purchasing
18 contracts.
19 Section 1.4 of this bill requires the Commission to: (1) recommend policies,
20 programs and procedures to encourage and promote purchasing from local businesses

Senate Amendment No. 516 to Senate Bill No. 71 Page 4
21 by local governments in this State; (2) create a supplier training program to educate
22 local businesses on the public procurement process; and (3) create a support and
23 outreach program that includes, without limitation, networking events and mentorship
24 opportunities for local businesses.
25 Section 1.6 of this bill requires each local government in a county that has a voting
26 member on the Commission to prepare and deliver an annual written report to the
27 Commission regarding their employees, purchasing expenditures and activities
28 undertaken relating to specified businesses during a fiscal year.
29 Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark
30 County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies, programs and procedures
31 to encourage and promote the use of local businesses owned and operated by disadvantaged
32 persons, particularly in the area of contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark
33 County. (Sections 15 and 20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at
34 pages 268 and 269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development
35 Advisory Council for Clark County . [, and sections 4-11 of this bill create the Nevada
36 Diverse Business Advisory Council, which has similar duties but a broader membership than
37 the former Council for Clark County. Section 8 prescribes the voting membership of the new
38 Council, including: (1) a representative of each county whose population is 100,000 or more
39 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties); (2) representatives from within each such county of
40 cities whose population is 7,000 or more (currently Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas,
41 Mesquite, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks), school districts, county fair and recreation
42 boards, law enforcement agencies, library districts, health districts, aviation agencies, regional
43 transportation commissions and water, wastewater and flood control agencies; (3)
44 representatives of associations of counties and cities; (4) representatives of institutions of the
45 Nevada System of Higher Education; and (5) the Administrator of the Purchasing Division.
46 Section 8 also authorizes the participation of other public and private entities as nonvoting
47 members. Sections 9 and 10 provide for the officers, meetings and expenses of the new
48 Council. Section 11: (1) sets forth the duties of the new Council, including recommending
49 policies, programs and procedures in the area of purchasing by public agencies to encourage
50 and promote the use of businesses primarily owned and operated by a person who is a member
51 of a racial or ethnic minority, female or a veteran or has a physical disability, or who identifies
52 as LGBTQ; and (2) requires the submission of certain biennial reports by member entities and
53 the Council.]
54 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the abolishment of the
55 Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark County and the [creation]
56 expansion of the [Nevada Diverse Business Advisory Council.] duties of the Commission to
57 Study Governmental Purchasing.
