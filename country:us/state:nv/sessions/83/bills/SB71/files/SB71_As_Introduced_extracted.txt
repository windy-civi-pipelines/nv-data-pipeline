Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the
2 purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments.
3 (Chapter 332 of NRS) The State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the
4 Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration, governs the purchasing
5 of supplies, materials, equipment and services by agencies of the Executive
6 Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions. (Chapter 333 of
7 NRS) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
8 government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
9 prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of
10 supplies, materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local
11 government or for state agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a
12 person may request notice of solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts
13 for such purchases.
14 Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for
15 Clark County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies,
-
*SB71*
– 2 –
16 programs and procedures to encourage and promote the use of local businesses
17 owned and operated by disadvantaged persons, particularly in the area of
18 contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark County. (Sections 15 and
19 20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at pages 268 and
20 269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development Advisory
21 Council for Clark County, and sections 4-11 of this bill create the Nevada Diverse
22 Business Advisory Council, which has similar duties but a broader membership
23 than the former Council for Clark County. Section 8 prescribes the voting
24 membership of the new Council, including: (1) a representative of each county
25 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties); (2)
26 representatives from within each such county of cities whose population is 7,000 or
27 more (currently Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite, North Las Vegas,
28 Reno and Sparks), school districts, county fair and recreation boards, law
29 enforcement agencies, library districts, health districts, aviation agencies, regional
30 transportation commissions and water, wastewater and flood control agencies; (3)
31 representatives of associations of counties and cities; (4) representatives of
32 institutions of the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (5) the Administrator
33 of the Purchasing Division. Section 8 also authorizes the participation of other
34 public and private entities as nonvoting members. Sections 9 and 10 provide for
35 the officers, meetings and expenses of the new Council. Section 11: (1) sets forth
36 the duties of the new Council, including recommending policies, programs and
37 procedures in the area of purchasing by public agencies to encourage and promote
38 the use of businesses primarily owned and operated by a person who is a member
39 of a racial or ethnic minority, female or a veteran or has a physical disability, or
40 who identifies as LGBTQ; and (2) requires the submission of certain biennial
41 reports by member entities and the Council. Section 12 of this bill makes a
42 conforming change as a result of the abolishment of the Regional Business
43 Development Advisory Council for Clark County and the creation of the Nevada
44 Diverse Business Advisory Council.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the
2 purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments.
3 (Chapter 332 of NRS) The State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the
4 Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration, governs the purchasing
5 of supplies, materials, equipment and services by agencies of the Executive
6 Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions. (Chapter 333 of
7 NRS) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
8 government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
9 prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of
10 supplies, materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local
11 government or for state agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a
12 person may request notice of solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts
13 for such purchases.
14 Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for
15 Clark County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies,
-

– 2 –
16 programs and procedures to encourage and promote the use of local businesses
17 owned and operated by disadvantaged persons, particularly in the area of
18 contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark County. (Sections 15 and
19 20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at pages 268 and
20 269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development Advisory
21 Council for Clark County, and sections 4-11 of this bill create the Nevada Diverse
22 Business Advisory Council, which has similar duties but a broader membership
23 than the former Council for Clark County. Section 8 prescribes the voting
24 membership of the new Council, including: (1) a representative of each county
25 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties); (2)
26 representatives from within each such county of cities whose population is 7,000 or
27 more (currently Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite, North Las Vegas,
28 Reno and Sparks), school districts, county fair and recreation boards, law
29 enforcement agencies, library districts, health districts, aviation agencies, regional
30 transportation commissions and water, wastewater and flood control agencies; (3)
31 representatives of associations of counties and cities; (4) representatives of
32 institutions of the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (5) the Administrator
33 of the Purchasing Division. Section 8 also authorizes the participation of other
34 public and private entities as nonvoting members. Sections 9 and 10 provide for
35 the officers, meetings and expenses of the new Council. Section 11: (1) sets forth
36 the duties of the new Council, including recommending policies, programs and
37 procedures in the area of purchasing by public agencies to encourage and promote
38 the use of businesses primarily owned and operated by a person who is a member
39 of a racial or ethnic minority, female or a veteran or has a physical disability, or
40 who identifies as LGBTQ; and (2) requires the submission of certain biennial
41 reports by member entities and the Council. Section 12 of this bill makes a
42 conforming change as a result of the abolishment of the Regional Business
43 Development Advisory Council for Clark County and the creation of the Nevada
44 Diverse Business Advisory Council.
