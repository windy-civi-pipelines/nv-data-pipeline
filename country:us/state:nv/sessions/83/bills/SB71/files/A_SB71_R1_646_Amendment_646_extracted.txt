_______________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to [purchasing.] governmental
administration. (BDR 27-366)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1.6)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [purchasing;] governmental administration; requiring certain
public entities to post certain information relating to purchasing on
their Internet websites; revising the duties of the Commission to Study
Governmental Purchasing; abolishing the Regional Business
Development Advisory Council for Clark County; eliminating a
requirement that institutions of the Nevada System of Higher
Education provide certain mentoring to certain businesses
participating in the NV Grow Program; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the purchasing of
2 supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments. (Chapter 332 of NRS) The
3 State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the Purchasing Division of the Department of
4 Administration, governs the purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by
5 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
6 (Chapter 333 of NRS) Sections 1.2 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
7 government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
8 prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of supplies,
9 materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local government or for state
10 agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a person may request notice of
11 solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts for such purchases.
12 Existing law requires the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing to study
13 practices in governmental purchasing and laws relating thereto and make recommendations
14 with respect to those laws to the next regular session of the Legislature. (NRS 332.215)
15 Section 1.8 of this bill provides instead that the Commission is required to: (1) review
16 practices in governmental purchasing; and (2) make recommendations to improve efficiency
17 and equity in governmental purchasing contracts.
Assembly Amendment No. 646 to Senate Bill No. 71 First Reprint Page 4
18 Section 1.4 of this bill requires the Commission to: (1) recommend policies, programs
19 and procedures to encourage and promote purchasing from local businesses by local
20 governments in this State; (2) create a supplier training program to educate local businesses on
21 the public procurement process; and (3) create a support and outreach program that includes,
22 without limitation, networking events and mentorship opportunities for local businesses.
23 Section 1.6 of this bill requires each local government in a county that has a voting
24 member on the Commission to prepare and deliver an annual written report to the
25 Commission regarding their employees, purchasing expenditures and activities undertaken
26 relating to specified businesses during a fiscal year.
27 Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark
28 County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies, programs and procedures
29 to encourage and promote the use of local businesses owned and operated by disadvantaged
30 persons, particularly in the area of contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark
31 County. (Sections 15 and 20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at
32 pages 268 and 269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development
33 Advisory Council for Clark County.
34 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the abolishment of the
35 Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark County and the expansion of the
36 duties of the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing.
37 Existing law requires Centers, which is defined to mean all institutions of the
38 Nevada System of Higher Education, to mentor businesses participating in the NV Grow
39 Program as to the optimum use of certain data relative to the making of business
40 decisions. (Section 3 of the NV Grow Act, chapter 459, Statutes of Nevada 2015, as last
41 amended by chapter 570, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 3668) Section 12 eliminates
42 this requirement.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [purchasing;] governmental administration; requiring certain
public entities to post certain information relating to purchasing on
their Internet websites; revising the duties of the Commission to Study
Governmental Purchasing; abolishing the Regional Business
Development Advisory Council for Clark County; eliminating a
requirement that institutions of the Nevada System of Higher
Education provide certain mentoring to certain businesses
participating in the NV Grow Program; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the purchasing of
2 supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments. (Chapter 332 of NRS) The
3 State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the Purchasing Division of the Department of
4 Administration, governs the purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by
5 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
6 (Chapter 333 of NRS) Sections 1.2 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
7 government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
8 prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of supplies,
9 materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local government or for state
10 agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a person may request notice of
11 solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts for such purchases.
12 Existing law requires the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing to study
13 practices in governmental purchasing and laws relating thereto and make recommendations
14 with respect to those laws to the next regular session of the Legislature. (NRS 332.215)
15 Section 1.8 of this bill provides instead that the Commission is required to: (1) review
16 practices in governmental purchasing; and (2) make recommendations to improve efficiency
17 and equity in governmental purchasing contracts.

Assembly Amendment No. 646 to Senate Bill No. 71 First Reprint Page 4
18 Section 1.4 of this bill requires the Commission to: (1) recommend policies, programs
19 and procedures to encourage and promote purchasing from local businesses by local
20 governments in this State; (2) create a supplier training program to educate local businesses on
21 the public procurement process; and (3) create a support and outreach program that includes,
22 without limitation, networking events and mentorship opportunities for local businesses.
23 Section 1.6 of this bill requires each local government in a county that has a voting
24 member on the Commission to prepare and deliver an annual written report to the
25 Commission regarding their employees, purchasing expenditures and activities undertaken
26 relating to specified businesses during a fiscal year.
27 Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark
28 County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies, programs and procedures
29 to encourage and promote the use of local businesses owned and operated by disadvantaged
30 persons, particularly in the area of contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark
31 County. (Sections 15 and 20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at
32 pages 268 and 269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development
33 Advisory Council for Clark County.
34 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the abolishment of the
35 Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark County and the expansion of the
36 duties of the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing.
37 Existing law requires Centers, which is defined to mean all institutions of the
38 Nevada System of Higher Education, to mentor businesses participating in the NV Grow
39 Program as to the optimum use of certain data relative to the making of business
40 decisions. (Section 3 of the NV Grow Act, chapter 459, Statutes of Nevada 2015, as last
41 amended by chapter 570, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 3668) Section 12 eliminates
42 this requirement.
