Council for Clark County; eliminating a requirement that

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
With certain exceptions, the Local Government Purchasing Act governs the
purchasing of supplies, materials, equipment and services by local governments.
(Chapter 332 of NRS) The State Purchasing Act, which is administered by the
Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration, governs the purchasing
of supplies, materials, equipment and services by agencies of the Executive
Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions. (Chapter 333 of
NRS) Sections 1.2 and 2 of this bill require the governing body of a local
government and the Administrator of the Purchasing Division, respectively, to post
prominently on their Internet websites: (1) information relating to the types of
supplies, materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local
government or for state agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a
person may request notice of solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts
for such purchases.
Existing law requires the Commission to Study Governmental Purchasing to
study practices in governmental purchasing and laws relating thereto and make
recommendations with respect to those laws to the next regular session of the
Legislature. (NRS 332.215) Section 1.8 of this bill provides instead that the
Commission is required to: (1) review practices in governmental purchasing; and
(2) make recommendations to improve efficiency and equity in governmental
purchasing contracts.
Section 1.4 of this bill requires the Commission to: (1) recommend policies,
programs and procedures to encourage and promote purchasing from local
businesses by local governments in this State; (2) create a supplier training program
to educate local businesses on the public procurement process; and (3) create a
support and outreach program that includes, without limitation, networking events
and mentorship opportunities for local businesses.
Section 1.6 of this bill requires each local government in a county that has a
voting member on the Commission to prepare and deliver an annual written report
to the Commission regarding their employees, purchasing expenditures and
activities undertaken relating to specified businesses during a fiscal year.
Existing law creates the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for
Clark County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies,
programs and procedures to encourage and promote the use of local businesses
owned and operated by disadvantaged persons, particularly in the area of
contracting and procurement by public agencies in Clark County. (Sections 15 and
20 of chapter 7, Statutes of Nevada 2003, 20th Special Session, at pages 268 and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
269) Section 15 of this bill abolishes the Regional Business Development Advisory
Council for Clark County.
Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the
abolishment of the Regional Business Development Advisory Council for Clark
County and the expansion of the duties of the Commission to Study Governmental
Purchasing.
Existing law requires Centers, which is defined to mean all institutions of the
Nevada System of Higher Education, to mentor businesses participating in the NV
Grow Program as to the optimum use of certain data relative to the making of
business decisions. (Section 3 of the NV Grow Act, chapter 459, Statutes of
Nevada 2015, as last amended by chapter 570, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page
3668) Section 12 eliminates this requirement.
