10 supplies, materials, equipment and services which are purchased by the local
11 government or for state agencies, as applicable; and (2) procedures by which a
12 person may request notice of solicitations or other methods of obtaining contracts

32 Clark County and requires the Council to propose and implement policies,
33 programs and procedures to encourage and promote the use of local businesses
34 owned and operated by disadvantaged persons, particularly in the area of
