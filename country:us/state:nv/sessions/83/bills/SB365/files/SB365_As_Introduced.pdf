AN ACT relating to attorneys; prohibiting an attorney who

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits an attorney who represents a plaintiff in a civil action
2 against a provider of health care for professional negligence from contracting for or
3 collecting a fee contingent on the amount of recovery in excess of 35 percent of the
4 amount recovered. Existing law defines “recovered” as the net sum recovered by
5 the plaintiff after any disbursements or costs in connection with the prosecution or
6 settlement of the claim and provides that costs of medical care incurred by the
7 plaintiff and general and administrative expenses incurred by the office of the
8 attorney are not deductible disbursements or costs. (NRS 7.095) Existing law also
9 limits the amount of a fee payable to all retained attorneys or law firms representing
10 certain state agencies under a contingent fee contract to 25 percent of the amount
11 recovered, exclusive of any costs and expenses provided for by the contract and
12 actually incurred by the retained attorneys or law firms. (NRS 228.1116)
13 This bill prohibits an attorney who represents a plaintiff in a civil action, other
14 than actions against a provider of health care for professional negligence or matters
15 contracted for by an attorney or law firm representing certain state agencies, from
16 contracting for or collecting a fee contingent on the amount of recovery in excess of
17 20 percent of the amount recovered. For such purposes, this bill defines
18 “recovered” as the net sum recovered by the plaintiff after deducting any
19 disbursements or costs in connection with the prosecution or settlement of the
20 claim.
