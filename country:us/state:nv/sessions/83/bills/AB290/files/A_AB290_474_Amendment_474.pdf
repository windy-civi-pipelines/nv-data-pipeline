the Commissioner of Insurance to compile certain reports; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
2 insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain circumstances. If an insurer
3 requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure for
4 obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
5 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
6 687B.225) This bill establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior
7 authorization for health and dental care by health insurers, including [Medicaid, the Children’s
8 Health Insurance Program and] insurance for public employees [.] as well as specific
9 requirements relating to prior authorization under Medicaid and the Children’s Health
10 Insurance Program (CHIP).
11 Specifically, sections 19 and 34 of this bill require that a procedure for obtaining prior
12 authorization includes: (1) a list of the [specific goods] items and services for which the
13 insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by the insurer to
14 evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 19 and 34 also require an insurer to publish
15 its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its Internet website . [and update that

Assembly Amendment No. 474 to Assembly Bill No. 290 Page 4
16 website as necessary to account for any changes in the procedure.] Sections 19 and 34
17 prohibit an insurer from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the
18 failure to obtain prior authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior
19 authorization in effect on the date that the care was provided did not require prior
20 authorization for that care.
21 [Sections] Section 12.5 of this bill requires insurers, other than those covering
22 recipients of Medicaid and CHIP, which employ or utilize an artificial intelligence
23 system or automated decision tool to process requests for prior authorization to transmit
24 a notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s use of the system or tool to
25 process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes certain aspects of the system
26 or tool. Section 12.5 also prohibits an insurer from using an artificial intelligence system
27 or automated decision tool to made an adverse determination on a request for prior
28 authorization, or to terminate, reduce or modify a previously approved request for prior
29 authorization, unless that action is independently reviewed by a physician or dentist, as
30 applicable, who possesses certain qualifications.
31 Section 19 [and 35 of this bill revise the period for insurers to take action on a request for

36 urgent; or (2) [twenty-four] 48 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent.
37 Section 35 of this bill requires entities providing coverage under Medicaid or CHIP,
38 including Medicaid managed care organizations, to approve, make an adverse

41 services, within 7 days after receiving the request. Sections 13 and 36 of this bill require
42 any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be made by [a licensed

44 Sections] certain authorized providers of health care. Section 13 [and 36 require] requires
45 an insurer [, in] , other than those covering recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to, in certain
46 circumstances, [to] allow the provider of health care who requested the prior authorization , or
47 certain colleagues of the provider, to discuss the issues involved in the request with the
48 physician or dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the request. Sections 13
49 and 36 require an insurer, upon making an adverse determination on a request for prior
50 authorization, to transmit certain information to the insured to whom the request pertains,
51 including information relating to the right of the insured to appeal the adverse determination.
52 [Sections] Section 13 [and 36 further require:] requires: (1) an insurer , other than those
53 covering recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to establish a process for appeals that provides for
54 the timely resolution of appeals submitted by insureds; and (2) a decision upholding an

56 dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or dentist who evaluates
57 initial requests for prior authorization.

59 determinations pertaining to recipients of Medicaid and CHIP.
60 Section 14 [and 37] of this bill: (1) [provide] provides that a request for prior

64 other medical or dental care; and (2) [require] requires such an insurer, for the first 90 days
65 of the coverage period for a new insured, to honor a request for prior authorization that has
66 been approved by the previous insurer of the new insured, under certain circumstances.
67 [Sections 14 and] Section 37 [prohibit an insurer from denying or imposing additional limits
68 on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if the care at issue
69 in the request is provided within 90 business days after the date on which the insurer receives
70 the request and certain other requirements are met.] of this bill provides that a request for

75 an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer earlier than the end of the business day
76 following the date of admission or the date on which the emergency services are provided.

85 violates any provision of section [13-15,] 12.5-15 or 19 [or 34-38] with respect to a particular
86 request for prior authorization, that the request is deemed approved. Sections 16 and 39 [also]
87 of this bill clarify that nothing in any provision of section [13-15,] 12.5-15, 19 or 34-38
88 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that the insurer does not cover, regardless
89 of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to persons to whom the insured is not obligated to
90 provide coverage.
91 [Sections] Section 17 [and 40] of this bill [require] requires an insurer , other than an

96 publish an annual report of certain information relating to requests for prior authorization
97 processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.] Section 17 additionally
98 requires the Commissioner to biennially transmit to the Legislature the data collected
99 from insurers for the biennium and a report summarizing the data. Sections 40 and 41

113 not required to comply with sections 2-19. Section 42 of this bill requires the policies and
114 procedures for coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 26-41.
115 Section 47.5 of this bill repeals provisions establishing certain requirements relating to

8 2. If a health carrier requires an insured or his or her provider of health
9 care to notify the health carrier that the insured has been admitted to a hospital
10 to receive emergency services or has received emergency services, the health
11 carrier shall not require an insured or a provider of health care to transmit such
12 a notice earlier than the end of the business day immediately following the day
13 after the date on which the insured was admitted or the emergency services were
14 provided, as applicable.
15 [3. A health carrier shall not deny coverage for emergency services covered
16 by the health carrier that are medically necessary. Emergency services are

18 admitted to receive emergency services, the insured’s provider of health care
19 transmits to the health carrier a certification, in writing, that the condition of the
20 insured required emergency services. The health carrier may rebut that
21 presumption by establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the
22 emergency services were not medically necessary.

24 services are medically necessary without regard to whether a provider of health
25 care that provided or billed for those services participates in the network of the
