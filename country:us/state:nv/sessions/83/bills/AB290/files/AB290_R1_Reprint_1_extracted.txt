(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; requiring an
insurer to publish certain information relating to requests
for prior authorization on the Internet; requiring an insurer
and the Commissioner of Insurance to compile certain
reports; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
-
*AB290_R1*
– 2 –
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 health and dental care by health insurers, including insurance for public employees
9 as well as specific requirements relating to prior authorization under Medicaid and
10 the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
11 Specifically, sections 19 and 34 of this bill require that a procedure for
12 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the items and services for which
13 the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by
14 the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 19 and 34 also
15 require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its
16 Internet website. Sections 19 and 34 prohibit an insurer from denying a claim for
17 payment for medical or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior
18 authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior authorization in effect
19 on the date that the care was provided did not require prior authorization for that
20 care.
21 Section 12.5 of this bill requires insurers, other than those covering recipients
22 of Medicaid and CHIP, which employ or utilize an artificial intelligence system or
23 automated decision tool to process requests for prior authorization to transmit a
24 notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s use of the system or tool to
25 process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes certain aspects of the
26 system or tool. Section 12.5 also prohibits an insurer from using an artificial
27 intelligence system or automated decision tool to make an adverse determination on
28 a request for prior authorization, or to terminate, reduce or modify a previously
29 approved request for prior authorization, unless that action is independently
30 reviewed by a physician or dentist, as applicable, who possesses certain
31 qualifications.
32 Section 19 requires an insurer, other than an insurer covering recipients of
33 Medicaid or CHIP, to approve or make an adverse determination on a request for
34 prior authorization, or request additional, medically relevant information within: (1)
35 7 days after receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or
36 (2) 48 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Section 35 of this
37 bill requires entities providing coverage under Medicaid or CHIP, including
38 Medicaid managed care organizations, to approve, make an adverse determination
39 on or request additional, medically relevant information for any request for prior
40 authorization, except for requests for prescription drugs and certain other services,
41 within 7 days after receiving the request. Sections 13 and 36 of this bill require any
42 adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be made by certain
43 authorized providers of health care. Section 13 requires an insurer, other than those
44 covering recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to, in certain circumstances, allow the
45 provider of health care who requested the prior authorization, or certain colleagues
46 of the provider, to discuss the issues involved in the request with the physician or
47 dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the request. Sections 13
48 and 36 require an insurer, upon making an adverse determination on a request for
49 prior authorization, to transmit certain information to the insured to whom the
50 request pertains, including information relating to the right of the insured to appeal
51 the adverse determination. Section 13 requires: (1) an insurer, other than those
52 covering recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to establish a process for appeals that
53 provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by insureds; and (2) a
54 decision upholding an adverse determination on an appeal submitted by an insured
55 to be made by a physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required
56 of a physician or dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
57 Section 36 establishes certain other requirements for appeals of adverse
58 determinations pertaining to recipients of Medicaid and CHIP.
59 Section 14 of this bill: (1) provides that a request for prior authorization that
60 has been approved by an insurer, other than an insurer covering recipients of
61 Medicaid or CHIP, remains valid for 12 months, if the approval is for a continuous
-
*AB290_R1*
– 3 –
62 course of care relating to a chronic or long-term condition, or 6 months for other
63 medical or dental care; and (2) requires such an insurer, for the first 90 days of the
64 coverage period for a new insured, to honor a request for prior authorization that
65 has been approved by the previous insurer of the new insured, under certain
66 circumstances. Section 37 of this bill provides that a request for prior authorization
67 approved for recipients of Medicaid and CHIP remains valid for 12 months after
68 approval, unless federal law provides for a different amount of time.
69 Sections 15 and 38 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
70 authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 15 and 38 also prohibit an
71 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
72 earlier than the end of the business day following the date of admission or the date
73 on which the emergency services are provided. Additionally, section 38: (1)
74 prohibits an insurer covering recipients of Medicaid and CHIP from denying
75 coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2) establishes a
76 presumption of such medical necessity under certain conditions.
77 Sections 3-12 and 27-32 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
78 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 26
79 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Section 16 of this bill
80 provide that if an insurer, other than an insurer covering recipients of Medicaid or
81 CHIP, violates any provision of section 12.5-15 or 19 with respect to a particular
82 request for prior authorization, that the request is deemed approved. Sections 16
83 and 39 of this bill clarify that nothing in any provision of section 12.5-15, 19 or
84 34-38 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that the insurer does not
85 cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to persons to whom the
86 insured is not obligated to provide coverage.
87 Section 17 of this bill requires an insurer, other than an insurer covering
88 recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to annually publish on its Internet website and
89 submit to the Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to requests
90 for prior authorization that have been processed by the insurer during the
91 immediately preceding year. Section 17 additionally requires the Commissioner to
92 biennially transmit to the Legislature the data collected from insurers for the
93 biennium and a report summarizing the data. Sections 40 and 41 of this bill impose
94 similar reporting requirements on entities providing coverage for recipients and
95 CHIP relating to requests for prior authorization received by those entities.
96 Section 20 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
97 service corporation to comply with sections 2-17. Section 21 of this bill requires
98 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
99 provisions of sections 26-41 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
100 governing Medicaid. Sections 22, 23 and 44 of this bill require plans of self-
101 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
102 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
103 with the requirements of sections 2-19 of this bill to the extent applicable. Sections
104 12.2 and 34 of this bill provide that a managed care organization that provides
105 services to recipients of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program is
106 subject to the requirements of sections 26-41, and is not required to comply with
107 sections 2-19. Section 42 of this bill requires the policies and procedures for
108 coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 26-41.
109 Section 47.5 of this bill repeals provisions establishing certain requirements
110 relating to prior authorization for dental care which sections 2-19 make redundant.

40 sharing obligation for the relevant medical or dental care.
41 4. A health carrier that has approved a request for prior
42 authorization shall not deny or refuse to promptly pay a claim for
43 the approved medical or dental care unless the health carrier
44 determines that the insured or provider of health care procured
45 the prior authorization by fraud or material misrepresentation.

1 5. Within the first 90 days of the coverage period for an
2 insured, a health carrier shall honor a request for prior
3 authorization that has been approved by a health carrier or other

8 contract or policy of insurance;

33 require an insured or a provider of health care to transmit such a
34 notice earlier than the end of the business day immediately
35 following the day after the date on which the insured was admitted
36 or the emergency services were provided, as applicable.

40 approved.

1 2. Upon rendering an adverse determination on a request for
2 prior authorization, the Department or a Medicaid managed care
3 entity, as applicable, shall immediately transmit to the recipient to
4 whom the request pertains a written notice that contains:
5 (a) A specific description of all reasons that the Department or
6 Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, made the adverse
7 determination;
8 (b) A description of any documentation that the Department or
9 Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, requested from the
10 recipient or a provider of health care of the recipient and did not
11 receive or deemed insufficient, if the failure to receive sufficient
12 documentation contributed to the adverse determination;
13 (c) A statement that the recipient has the right to appeal the
14 adverse determination;
15 (d) Instructions, written in clear language that is
16 understandable to an ordinary layperson, describing how the

18 process for appeals established pursuant to subsection 3; and
19 (e) A description of any documentation that may be necessary
20 or pertinent to a potential appeal.
21 3. The Department shall establish a process that allows a
22 recipient to appeal an adverse determination on a request for prior
23 authorization. The Department may elect to utilize the procedures
24 for hearings established for appeals of denials of claims of
25 benefits under Medicaid pursuant to NRS 422.275 to 422.280,
26 inclusive, to satisfy that requirement. If the Department utilizes
27 such procedures for that purpose, the Department shall, upon the
28 request of a hearing officer, make available to the hearing officer
29 a licensed medical professional, which may include the Medical
30 Director for Medicaid, as available, to provide clinical input and
31 expertise which may be necessary to evaluate the appeal of an
32 adverse determination.
33 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 3, a Medicaid
34 managed care entity may establish a separate process that allows a
35 recipient to appeal an adverse determination on a request for prior
36 authorization. If the Medicaid managed care entity does not
37 reverse the adverse determination after the exhaustion of that
38 process, the recipient my appeal to the Department pursuant to
39 subsection 3.
40 Sec. 37. 1. If the Department or a Medicaid managed care
41 entity approves a request for prior authorization, the approval
42 remains valid until 12 months after the date on which the request
43 is approved or, if federal law establishes a different amount of
44 time for which a request for prior authorization is required to
45 remain valid, the amount of time established by the federal law.

1 2. The Department or a Medicaid managed care entity shall
2 not revoke or impose an additional limit, condition or restriction
3 on a request for prior authorization that the Department or
4 Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, has previously
5 approved unless:
6 (a) The care at issue in the request was not provided to the
7 recipient within 90 business days after the Department or
8 Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, received the request;
9 (b) The Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as
10 applicable, determines that a recipient or a provider of health care
11 procured the approval by fraud or material misrepresentation; or
12 (c) The Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as
13 applicable, determines that the care at issue in the request was not
14 covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program,
15 as applicable, at the time the care was provided.
16 3. If the Department or a Medicaid managed care entity has
17 approved a request for prior authorization, the Department or
18 Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, shall not deny or
19 refuse to promptly pay a clean claim for the approved medical
20 or dental care unless:
21 (a) The claim is not timely submitted;
22 (b) The claim is not submitted in accordance with the
23 requirements of the Department or the Federal Government; or
24 (c) The Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as
25 applicable, determines that the recipient or provider of health care
26 procured the prior authorization by fraud or material
27 misrepresentation.
28 4. If the Department or a Medicaid managed care entity does
29 not deny a clean claim for approved medical or dental care
30 pursuant to subsection 3, the Department or Medicaid managed
31 care entity, as applicable, shall pay the claim at the same rate that
32 the Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, is
33 contractually obligated to or would ordinarily pay a provider of
34 health care for providing the specific type of care that was
35 approved and provided to the recipient.
36 5. As used in this section, “clean claim” has the meaning
37 ascribed to it in 42 C.F.R. § 447.45.
38 Sec. 38. 1. The Department or a Medicaid managed care
39 entity, with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health
40 Insurance Program, shall not require prior authorization for
41 covered emergency services, including, where applicable,
42 transportation by ambulance to a hospital or other medical
43 facility.
44 2. If the Department or a Medicaid managed care entity
45 requires a recipient or his or her provider of health care to notify
-
*AB290_R1*
– 23 –
1 the Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable,
2 that the recipient has been admitted to a hospital to receive
3 emergency services or has received emergency services, the
4 Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, shall
5 not require a recipient or a provider of health care to transmit
6 such a notice earlier than the end of the business day immediately
7 following the day after the date on which the recipient was
8 admitted or the emergency services were provided, as applicable.
9 3. The Department or a Medicaid managed care entity shall
10 not deny coverage for emergency services covered by Medicaid or
11 the Children’s Health Insurance Program that are medically
12 necessary. Emergency services are presumed to be medically
13 necessary if, within 72 hours after a recipient is admitted to
14 receive emergency services, the recipient’s provider of health care
15 transmits to the Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as
16 applicable, a certification, in writing, that the condition of the
17 recipient required emergency services. The Department or
18 Medicaid managed care entity may rebut that presumption by
19 establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the emergency
20 services were not medically necessary.
21 4. As used in this section, “emergency services” means health
22 care services that are provided by a provider of health care to
23 screen and to stabilize a recipient after the sudden onset of a
24 medical condition that manifests itself by symptoms of such
25 sufficient severity that a prudent person would believe that the
26 absence of immediate medical attention could result in:
27 (a) Serious jeopardy to the health of the recipient;
28 (b) Serious jeopardy to the health of a fetus of the recipient;
29 (c) Serious impairment of a bodily function of the recipient; or
30 (d) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of the
31 recipient.
32 Sec. 39. Nothing in sections 34 to 38, inclusive, of this act
33 shall be construed to require the Department or a Medicaid
34 managed care entity to provide coverage:
35 1. For medical or dental care that, regardless of whether such
36 care is medically necessary, would not be a covered benefit under
37 the terms and conditions of Medicaid or the Children’s Health
38 Insurance Program, as applicable; or
39 2. To a person who is not a recipient or is not otherwise
40 eligible to receive coverage under Medicaid or the Children’s
41 Health Insurance Program, as applicable, on the date on which
42 medical or dental care is provided to the person.
43 Sec. 40. 1. On or before March 1 of each calendar year, the
44 Department and each Medicaid managed care entity shall publish
45 on an Internet website maintained by the Department or Medicaid

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to prior authorization for
medical or dental care under health insurance plans.
(BDR 57-861)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 22)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; requiring an
insurer to publish certain information relating to requests
for prior authorization on the Internet; requiring an insurer
and the Commissioner of Insurance to compile certain
reports; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
-
*AB290_R1*

– 2 –
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 health and dental care by health insurers, including insurance for public employees
9 as well as specific requirements relating to prior authorization under Medicaid and
10 the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
11 Specifically, sections 19 and 34 of this bill require that a procedure for
12 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the items and services for which
13 the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by
14 the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 19 and 34 also
15 require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its
16 Internet website. Sections 19 and 34 prohibit an insurer from denying a claim for
17 payment for medical or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior
18 authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior authorization in effect
19 on the date that the care was provided did not require prior authorization for that
20 care.
21 Section 12.5 of this bill requires insurers, other than those covering recipients
22 of Medicaid and CHIP, which employ or utilize an artificial intelligence system or
23 automated decision tool to process requests for prior authorization to transmit a
24 notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s use of the system or tool to
25 process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes certain aspects of the
26 system or tool. Section 12.5 also prohibits an insurer from using an artificial
27 intelligence system or automated decision tool to make an adverse determination on
28 a request for prior authorization, or to terminate, reduce or modify a previously
29 approved request for prior authorization, unless that action is independently
30 reviewed by a physician or dentist, as applicable, who possesses certain
31 qualifications.
32 Section 19 requires an insurer, other than an insurer covering recipients of
33 Medicaid or CHIP, to approve or make an adverse determination on a request for
34 prior authorization, or request additional, medically relevant information within: (1)
35 7 days after receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or
36 (2) 48 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Section 35 of this
37 bill requires entities providing coverage under Medicaid or CHIP, including
38 Medicaid managed care organizations, to approve, make an adverse determination
39 on or request additional, medically relevant information for any request for prior
40 authorization, except for requests for prescription drugs and certain other services,
41 within 7 days after receiving the request. Sections 13 and 36 of this bill require any
42 adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be made by certain
43 authorized providers of health care. Section 13 requires an insurer, other than those
44 covering recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to, in certain circumstances, allow the
45 provider of health care who requested the prior authorization, or certain colleagues
46 of the provider, to discuss the issues involved in the request with the physician or
47 dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the request. Sections 13
48 and 36 require an insurer, upon making an adverse determination on a request for
49 prior authorization, to transmit certain information to the insured to whom the
50 request pertains, including information relating to the right of the insured to appeal
51 the adverse determination. Section 13 requires: (1) an insurer, other than those
52 covering recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to establish a process for appeals that
53 provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by insureds; and (2) a
54 decision upholding an adverse determination on an appeal submitted by an insured
55 to be made by a physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required
56 of a physician or dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
57 Section 36 establishes certain other requirements for appeals of adverse
58 determinations pertaining to recipients of Medicaid and CHIP.
59 Section 14 of this bill: (1) provides that a request for prior authorization that
60 has been approved by an insurer, other than an insurer covering recipients of
61 Medicaid or CHIP, remains valid for 12 months, if the approval is for a continuous
-
*AB290_R1*

– 3 –
62 course of care relating to a chronic or long-term condition, or 6 months for other
63 medical or dental care; and (2) requires such an insurer, for the first 90 days of the
64 coverage period for a new insured, to honor a request for prior authorization that
65 has been approved by the previous insurer of the new insured, under certain
66 circumstances. Section 37 of this bill provides that a request for prior authorization
67 approved for recipients of Medicaid and CHIP remains valid for 12 months after
68 approval, unless federal law provides for a different amount of time.
69 Sections 15 and 38 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
70 authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 15 and 38 also prohibit an
71 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
72 earlier than the end of the business day following the date of admission or the date
73 on which the emergency services are provided. Additionally, section 38: (1)
74 prohibits an insurer covering recipients of Medicaid and CHIP from denying
75 coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2) establishes a
76 presumption of such medical necessity under certain conditions.
77 Sections 3-12 and 27-32 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
78 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 26
79 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Section 16 of this bill
80 provide that if an insurer, other than an insurer covering recipients of Medicaid or
81 CHIP, violates any provision of section 12.5-15 or 19 with respect to a particular
82 request for prior authorization, that the request is deemed approved. Sections 16
83 and 39 of this bill clarify that nothing in any provision of section 12.5-15, 19 or
84 34-38 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that the insurer does not
85 cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to persons to whom the
86 insured is not obligated to provide coverage.
87 Section 17 of this bill requires an insurer, other than an insurer covering
88 recipients of Medicaid or CHIP, to annually publish on its Internet website and
89 submit to the Commissioner of Insurance certain information relating to requests
90 for prior authorization that have been processed by the insurer during the
91 immediately preceding year. Section 17 additionally requires the Commissioner to
92 biennially transmit to the Legislature the data collected from insurers for the
93 biennium and a report summarizing the data. Sections 40 and 41 of this bill impose
94 similar reporting requirements on entities providing coverage for recipients and
95 CHIP relating to requests for prior authorization received by those entities.
96 Section 20 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
97 service corporation to comply with sections 2-17. Section 21 of this bill requires
98 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
99 provisions of sections 26-41 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
100 governing Medicaid. Sections 22, 23 and 44 of this bill require plans of self-
101 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
102 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
103 with the requirements of sections 2-19 of this bill to the extent applicable. Sections
104 12.2 and 34 of this bill provide that a managed care organization that provides
105 services to recipients of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program is
106 subject to the requirements of sections 26-41, and is not required to comply with
107 sections 2-19. Section 42 of this bill requires the policies and procedures for
108 coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 26-41.
109 Section 47.5 of this bill repeals provisions establishing certain requirements
110 relating to prior authorization for dental care which sections 2-19 make redundant.

7 adequately managed without receiving such care.
8 2. Does not include emergency services.
9 Sec. 12.2. NRS 687B.225 and sections 2 to 17, inclusive, of

11 procured the approval by fraud or material misrepresentation; or

32 the Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as applicable, is

34 health care for providing the specific type of care that was
35 approved and provided to the recipient.

14 receive emergency services, the recipient’s provider of health care
15 transmits to the Department or Medicaid managed care entity, as

22 care services that are provided by a provider of health care to
23 screen and to stabilize a recipient after the sudden onset of a

36 care is medically necessary, would not be a covered benefit under
37 the terms and conditions of Medicaid or the Children’s Health
38 Insurance Program, as applicable; or
39 2. To a person who is not a recipient or is not otherwise
40 eligible to receive coverage under Medicaid or the Children’s
