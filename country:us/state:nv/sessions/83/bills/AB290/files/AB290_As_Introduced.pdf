~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; requiring an
insurer to publish certain information relating to requests
for prior authorization on the Internet; requiring an insurer
and the Commissioner of Insurance to compile certain
reports; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 health and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health
9 Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.

10 Specifically, sections 19 and 34 of this bill require that a procedure for
11 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services
12 for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review
13 criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 19
14 and 34 also require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
15 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to
16 account for any changes in the procedure. Sections 19 and 34 prohibit an insurer
17 from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the failure
18 to obtain prior authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior
19 authorization in effect on the date that the care was provided did not require prior
20 authorization for that care.
21 Sections 19 and 35 of this bill revise the period for insurers to take action on a
22 request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer to approve or make an
23 adverse determination on such a request, or request additional, medically relevant
24 information within: (1) five days after receiving the request, for medical or dental
25 care that is not urgent; or (2) twenty-four hours after receiving the request, for care
26 that is urgent. Sections 13 and 36 of this bill require any adverse determination on
27 a request for prior authorization to be made by a licensed physician or, for a request
28 relating to dental care, a dentist, who has certain qualifications. Sections 13 and 36
29 require an insurer, in certain circumstances, to allow the provider of health care
30 who requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request
31 with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the
32 request. Sections 13 and 36 require an insurer, upon making an adverse
33 determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to
34 the insured to whom the request pertains, including information relating to the right
35 of the insured to appeal the adverse determination. Sections 13 and 36 further
36 require: (1) an insurer to establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely
37 resolution of appeals submitted by insureds; and (2) a decision upholding an
38 adverse determination on an appeal submitted by an insured to be made by a
39 physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or
40 dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
41 Sections 14 and 37 of this bill: (1) provide that a request for prior authorization
42 that has been approved by the insurer remains valid for 12 months; and (2) require
43 an insurer, for the first 90 days of the coverage period for a new insured, to honor a
44 request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the
45 new insured, under certain circumstances. Sections 14 and 37 prohibit an insurer
46 from denying or imposing additional limits on a request for prior authorization that
47 the insurer has previously approved if the care at issue in the request is provided
48 within 90 business days after the date on which the insurer receives the request and
49 certain other requirements are met.
50 Sections 15 and 38 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
51 authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 15 and 38 also prohibit an
52 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
53 earlier than the end of the business day following the date of admission or the date
54 on which the emergency services are provided. Finally, sections 15 and 38: (1)
55 prohibit an insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary
56 emergency services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under
57 certain conditions.
58 Sections 3-12 and 27-33 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
59 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 26
60 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 16 and 39 of
61 this bill provide that if an insurer violates any provision of section 13-15, 19 or 34-
62 38 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the request is
63 deemed approved. Sections 16 and 39 also clarify that nothing in any provision of
64 section 13-15, 19 or 34-38 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that
-
*AB290*

– 3 –
65 the insurer does not cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to
66 persons to whom the insured is not obligated to provide coverage.
67 Sections 17 and 40 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its
68 Internet website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that
69 have been processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
70 Sections 18 and 41 of this bill additionally require an insurer to publish an annual
71 report of certain information relating to requests for prior authorization processed
72 by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
73 Section 20 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
74 service corporation to comply with sections 2-18. Section 21 of this bill requires
75 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
76 provisions of sections 25-41 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
77 governing Medicaid. Sections 22, 23 and 44 of this bill require plans of self-
78 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
79 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
80 with the requirements of sections 2-19 of this bill to the extent applicable. Section
81 25 provides that a managed care organization that provides services to recipients of
82 Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program is not subject to sections 26-
83 41, but must comply with sections 2-19. Section 42 of this bill requires the policies
84 and procedures for coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with
85 sections 26-41.

16 care is medically necessary, would not be a covered benefit under
17 the terms and conditions of the contract or policy of insurance;

22 of a contract or policy of insurance, has no coverage under the
23 contract or policy on the date on which medical or dental care is
24 provided to the insured.

26 health carrier shall publish on an Internet website maintained by

3 date on which the request is approved.
4 2. The Department shall not revoke or impose an additional

6 that the Department has previously approved unless:
7 (a) The care at issue in the request was not provided to the
8 recipient within 90 business days after the Department received
9 the request;
10 (b) The Department determines that a recipient or a provider
11 of health care procured the approval by fraud or material
12 misrepresentation; or
13 (c) The Department determines that the care at issue in the
14 request was not covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health
15 Insurance Program, as applicable, at the time the care was
16 provided.
17 3. If the Department has approved a request for prior
18 authorization, the Department shall not deny or refuse to promptly
19 pay a claim for the approved medical or dental care unless the
20 Department determines that the recipient or provider of health
21 care procured the prior authorization by fraud or material
22 misrepresentation. The claim must be paid at the same rate that
23 the Department is contractually obligated to or would ordinarily
24 pay a provider of health care for providing the specific type of care
25 that was approved and provided to the recipient.
26 4. Within the first 90 days that a recipient is enrolled in
27 Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as
28 applicable, the Department shall honor a request for prior

33 preceding the first day of the enrollment of the recipient; and

42 the Children’s Health Insurance Program, shall not require prior
43 authorization for covered emergency services, including, where

1 2. If the Department requires a recipient or his or her
2 provider of health care to notify the Department that the recipient
3 has been admitted to a hospital to receive emergency services or

8 emergency services were provided, as applicable.
9 3. The Department shall not deny coverage for emergency
10 services covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
11 Program that are medically necessary. Emergency services are
12 presumed to be medically necessary if, within 72 hours after a
13 recipient is admitted to receive emergency services, the recipient’s
14 provider of health care transmits to the Department a certification,
15 in writing, that the condition of the recipient required emergency
16 services. The Department may rebut that presumption by
17 establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the emergency
18 services were not medically necessary.

20 inclusive, of this act with respect to a particular request for prior

26 the terms and conditions of Medicaid or the Children’s Health
27 Insurance Program, as applicable; or
28 (b) To a person who is not a recipient or is not otherwise
29 eligible to receive coverage under Medicaid or the Children’s
30 Health Insurance Program, as applicable, on the date on which
31 medical or dental care is provided to the person.

33 Department shall publish on an Internet website maintained by
34 the Department in an easily accessible format the following
