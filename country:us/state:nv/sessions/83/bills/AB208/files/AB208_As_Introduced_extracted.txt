FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental entities; restricting the manner in
which a governmental entity or a government-funded
entity may use certain products; providing certain
exceptions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a governmental entity or a
2 government-funded entity from using a product that is or has ever been protected by a
3 patent granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or is subject to
4 review by certain federal agencies in a manner: (1) that is contrary to the terms of use
5 of that product established by the current or most recent holder of the patent for the
6 product or the manufacturer or distributor of the product; (2) that is inconsistent with
7 any written instructions, limitations or directed uses included with the product; or (3)
8 that exceeds the scope of the approved usage of the product, if a federal agency has
9 approved the product for specific uses.
10 However, this bill authorizes a governmental entity or government-funded entity
11 to use a product in such a manner if the governmental entity or government-funded
12 entity, as applicable, transmits a written notice of the intended use to the patent holder
13 and the manufacturer or distributor of the product, if different from the patent holder,
14 that: (1) identifies the specific product at issue; and (2) describes the specific manner
15 in which the entity plans to use the product. This bill authorizes the patent holder or
16 the manufacturer or distributor of a product to object to the use of the product in such
17 a manner by transmitting a written notice of the objection to the governmental entity
18 or government-funded entity. Once the governmental entity or government-funded
19 entity receives a notice of objection from the patent holder, manufacturer or
20 distributor, this bill requires the governmental entity or government-funded entity, as
21 applicable, to cease and desist from using the product in the manner to which the
22 patent holder, manufacturer or distributor objects.
