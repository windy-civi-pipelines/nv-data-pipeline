AN ACT relating to governmental entities; restricting the manner in
which certain governmental entities or government-
funded entities may use certain products; providing
certain exceptions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a governmental entity or a
2 government-funded entity that operates, administers or contracts with a mental
3 health facility or place of confinement from using a product that is or has ever been
4 protected by a patent granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or is
5 subject to review by certain federal agencies in a manner: (1) that is contrary to the
6 terms of use of that product established by the current or most recent holder of the
7 patent for the product or the manufacturer or distributor of the product; (2) that is
8 inconsistent with any written instructions, limitations or directed uses included with
9 the product; or (3) that exceeds the scope of the approved usage of the product, if a
10 federal agency has approved the product for specific uses. This bill also prohibits
11 such a governmental entity or government-funded entity from providing or
12 dispensing such a product for use in such a manner.
13 However, this bill authorizes a covered entity to use, provide or dispense a
14 product in such a manner if the covered entity transmits a written notice of the
15 intended use to the patent holder and the manufacturer or distributor of the product,
16 if different from the patent holder, that: (1) identifies the specific product at issue;
17 and (2) describes the specific manner in which the entity plans to use, provide or
18 dispense the product. This bill authorizes the patent holder or the manufacturer or
19 distributor of a product to object to the use, provision or dispensing of the product
20 in such a manner by transmitting a written notice of the objection to the covered
21 entity. Once the covered entity receives a notice of objection from the patent
22 holder, manufacturer or distributor, this bill requires the covered entity to cease and
23 desist from using, providing or dispensing the product in the manner to which the
-

24 patent holder, manufacturer or distributor objects. This bill further authorizes a
25 covered entity to provide or dispense a patented or reviewed product to a resident
26 of a mental health facility or place of confinement to be used in a non-conforming
27 manner without providing notice to the patent holder, manufacturer and distributor
28 of the product if the resident to whom the product is provided or dispensed provides
29 informed consent with respect to the use and receipt of the product.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 237 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as authorized by this section, a covered entity shall
4 not use a federally reviewed product or provide or dispense a
5 federally reviewed product to a resident for use, regardless of how
6 the product was obtained, in a manner that:
7 (a) Is contrary to the terms of use established for the federally
8 reviewed product by the patent holder, manufacturer or
9 distributor;
10 (b) Is inconsistent with any written directions, instructions,
11 limitations or intended usages for the federally reviewed product
12 that:
13 (1) Accompany the product;
14 (2) Are printed on the product; or
15 (3) Are printed on any label or packaging for the product;
16 or
17 (c) Is not one of the approved uses or purposes of the federally
18 reviewed product, if the product is approved for specific uses or
19 purposes by an agency of the Federal Government.
20 2. Except as otherwise provided by subsection 5, a covered
21 entity may use, provide or dispense a federally reviewed product in
22 a manner described in subsection 1 if:
23 (a) The covered entity transmits a written notice to the patent
24 holder and the manufacturer and distributor of the federally
25 reviewed product, if different from the patent holder, that:
26 (1) Sufficiently identifies the federally reviewed product
27 that the covered entity seeks to use, provide or dispense; and
28 (2) Describes the specific manner in or purposes for which
29 the covered entity plans to use, provide or dispense the federally

31 (b) At least 30 days have elapsed after the transmission of the

– 3 –
1 3. If a patent holder or a manufacturer or distributor of a
2 federally reviewed product has reason to believe that a covered
3 entity is using, providing or dispensing or plans to use, provide or
4 dispense a federally reviewed product in a manner described in
5 subsection 1, based on a notice received pursuant to subsection 2
6 or for any other reason, the patent holder, manufacturer or
7 distributor may object to such use by transmitting a written notice
8 to the covered entity that:
9 (a) Identifies the federally reviewed product at issue;
10 (b) Specifically describes the manner of use of the federally
11 reviewed product to which the patent holder, manufacturer or
12 distributor, as applicable, objects;
13 (c) Explains the reasons that the patent holder, manufacturer
14 or distributor believes such manner of use of the federally
15 reviewed product violates subsection 1; and
16 (d) Requests that the covered entity cease and desist from
17 using, providing or dispensing the federally reviewed product in
18 the manner described in paragraph (b).
19 4. A patent holder or a manufacturer or distributor of a
20 federally reviewed product may withdraw an objection made
21 pursuant to subsection 3 by transmitting a written notice to the
22 covered entity to which the patent holder, manufacturer or
23 distributor, as applicable, transmitted the objection pursuant to
24 subsection 3. The notice must identify:
25 (a) The federally reviewed product at issue; and
26 (b) The manner of use of the federally reviewed product
27 described in paragraph (b) of subsection 3 to which the patent
28 holder, manufacturer or distributor, as applicable, no longer

31 subsection 6, upon receiving a written notice described in
32 subsection 3 from a patent holder or the manufacturer or
33 distributor of a federally reviewed product, a covered entity shall
34 immediately cease and desist from using, providing or dispensing
35 the federally reviewed product in the manner described in the
36 notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3. A covered entity
37 may use, provide or dispense the federally reviewed product in
38 such a manner if the covered entity subsequently receives a written
39 notice withdrawing any objection for that particular manner of
40 use pursuant to subsection 4 from all patent holders,
41 manufacturers and distributors that have objected to that
42 particular manner of use pursuant to subsection 3.
43 6. A covered entity may provide or dispense a federally
44 reviewed product to a resident to be used in a manner described in
