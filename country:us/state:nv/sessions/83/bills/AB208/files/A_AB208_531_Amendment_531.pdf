EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental entities; restricting the manner in which [a]
certain governmental [entity] entities or [a] government-funded
[entity] entities may use certain products; providing certain
exceptions; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a governmental entity or a government-funded
2 entity that operates, administers or contracts with a mental health facility or place of
3 confinement from using a product that is or has ever been protected by a patent granted by the
4 United States Patent and Trademark Office or is subject to review by certain federal agencies in a
5 manner: (1) that is contrary to the terms of use of that product established by the current or most
6 recent holder of the patent for the product or the manufacturer or distributor of the product; (2)
7 that is inconsistent with any written instructions, limitations or directed uses included with the
8 product; or (3) that exceeds the scope of the approved usage of the product, if a federal agency
9 has approved the product for specific uses. This bill also prohibits such a governmental
10 entity or government-funded entity from providing or dispensing such a product for use
11 in such a manner.
12 However, this bill authorizes a [governmental entity or government-funded] covered entity
13 to use , provide or dispense a product in such a manner if the [governmental entity or
14 government-funded entity, as applicable,] covered entity transmits a written notice of the
15 intended use to the patent holder and the manufacturer or distributor of the product, if different
16 from the patent holder, that: (1) identifies the specific product at issue; and (2) describes the
17 specific manner in which the entity plans to use , provide or dispense the product. This bill
18 authorizes the patent holder or the manufacturer or distributor of a product to object to the use ,
19 provision or dispensing of the product in such a manner by transmitting a written notice of the
20 objection to the [governmental entity or government-funded] covered entity. Once the
21 [governmental entity or government-funded] covered entity receives a notice of objection from
22 the patent holder, manufacturer or distributor, this bill requires the [governmental entity or
23 government-funded entity, as applicable,] covered entity to cease and desist from using ,
24 providing or dispensing the product in the manner to which the patent holder, manufacturer or
25 distributor objects. This bill further authorizes a covered entity to provide or dispense a
26 patented or reviewed product to a resident of a mental health facility or place of
27 confinement to be used in a non-conforming manner without providing notice to the
28 patent holder, manufacturer and distributor of the product if the resident to whom the
29 product is provided or dispensed provides informed consent with respect to the use and
30 receipt of the product.
