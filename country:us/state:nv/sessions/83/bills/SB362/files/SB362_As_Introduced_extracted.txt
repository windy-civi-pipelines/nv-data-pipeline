Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various provisions governing the licensing and control
2 of gaming in this State. (Chapter 463 of NRS) Existing regulations require each
3 person who is licensed to conduct restricted or nonrestricted gaming and who
4 engages in the issuance of credit, check cashing or the direct mail marketing of
5 gaming opportunities to implement a program related to allowing patrons to self-
6 limit access to such credit, check cashing or direct mail marketing. (Nev. Gaming
7 Comm’n Regs. § 5.170) Section 2 of this bill codifies in statute the requirement for
8 the Commission to adopt regulations to implement such a program and expands the
9 program to include communications through direct marketing by mail, telephone,
10 text message or electronic mail.
11 Existing law provides for the issuance of restricted and nonrestricted licenses to
12 conduct gaming and defines a “nonrestricted license” as, among other things, a
13 state gaming license for, or an operation consisting of, 16 or more slot machines.
14 (NRS 463.0177) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the Commission to adopt
15 regulations and establish the necessary fees for a license to operate a tavern gaming
16 establishment; (2) sets forth the requirements for a tavern gaming establishment;
17 and (3) authorizes a tavern gaming establishment to, among other things, operate 25
18 or fewer gaming devices. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to
-
*SB362*
– 2 –
19 exclude a license for the operation of a tavern gaming establishment from the
20 definition of “nonrestricted license” for purposes of the provisions governing the
21 licensing and control of gaming.
22 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make an
23 investigation and initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Commission if the
24 Board is satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found
25 suitable or found preliminarily suitable or was previously approved for an activity
26 for which Commission approval was required or permitted should have its license,
27 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability limited,
28 conditioned, suspended, revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
29 retains the jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission after a person or entity
30 who is licensed, registered, found suitable or preliminarily found suitable is no
31 longer engaged in the activity or position for which Commission approval was
32 required; and (2) provides that the surrender or attempted surrender of a license,
33 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability is not
34 effective until accepted by the Board. Existing law also provides that a voluntary
35 surrender of a license by a licensee does not become effective until accepted in the
36 manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the Commission. (NRS 463.270)
37 Section 10 of this bill provides instead that such a voluntary surrender does not
38 become effective until accepted in the manner provided by the Board.
39 Existing law defines “interactive gaming” and authorizes certain gaming
40 establishments to obtain a license to operate interactive gaming. (NRS 463.016425,
41 463.750) Section 5 of this bill requires the Commission, with the advice and
42 assistance of the Board, to adopt regulations governing interactive gaming that
43 allow for a sports pool, including the acceptance of wagers on sporting events and
44 other events from patrons located within and outside of this State. Section 7 of this
45 bill revises the definition of “interactive gaming” to include a sports pool, which by
46 definition means the business of accepting wagers on sporting events or other
47 events by any system or method of wagering. (NRS 463.0193) Section 14 of this
48 bill makes a conforming change to exclude interactive gaming from the criminal
49 penalties for accepting, receiving or allowing another to accept or receive a wager
50 from a person physically present in this State. (NRS 465.092, 465.093)
51 Existing law requires certain persons to apply for and obtain a finding of
52 suitability, license or registration from the Nevada Gaming Commission under
53 certain circumstances. (NRS 463.530, 463.585, 463.595, 463.643) Existing
54 regulations define “institutional investor” for certain purposes related to gaming.
55 (Nev. Gaming Comm’n Regs. § 16.010) Section 6 of this bill codifies the definition
56 of institutional investor for certain purposes and prohibits such an investor from
57 becoming eligible to receive or hold a waiver granted by the Commission under
58 certain circumstances.
59 Existing law provides that after a final order of the Board recommending denial
60 of an application for a license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, the
61 Commission may: (1) deny the application; (2) reject the application; (3) remand
62 the matter to the Board for further investigation and reconsideration; or (4) by
63 unanimous vote of the members present, grant the application. (NRS 463.220)
64 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Commission, after receiving a final order of the
65 Board recommending approval of such an application, to deny the application by
66 unanimous vote of the members present.
67 Under existing law, a state of emergency or a declaration of disaster may be
68 proclaimed by the Governor or by resolution of the Legislature if the Governor or
69 Legislature, as applicable, finds that: (1) an attack upon the United States has
70 occurred or is anticipated in the immediate future, or any natural, technological or
71 man-made emergency or disaster of major proportions has actually occurred within
72 this State; and (2) the protection of the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this
73 State requires an invocation of certain additional governmental powers.
-
*SB362*
– 3 –
74 (NRS 414.070) Sections 11-13 of this bill authorize the Commission, in response to
75 a state of emergency or declaration of disaster proclaimed by the Governor or by
76 resolution of the Legislature, to reduce, defer or forgive certain fees charged to a
77 licensee.

1 Sec. 10. NRS 463.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 463.270 1. Subject to the power of the Commission to deny,
3 revoke, suspend, condition or limit licenses, any state license in

16 tax.
17 4. Application for renewal of licenses for slot machines only

19 are situated.
20 5. Any person failing to pay any state license fees or taxes due
21 at the times respectively provided shall pay in addition to such
22 license fees or taxes a penalty of not less than $50 or 25 percent of

24 if the fees or taxes are less than 10 days late and in no case in excess
25 of $5,000. The penalty must be collected as are other charges,
26 license fees and penalties under this chapter.
27 6. Any person who operates, carries on or exposes for play any
28 gambling game, gaming device or slot machine or who
29 manufactures, sells or distributes any gaming device, equipment,
30 material or machine used in gaming after the person’s license

32 as provided in this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in
33 addition to the penalties provided by law, is liable to the State of
34 Nevada for all license fees, taxes and penalties which would have
35 been due upon application for renewal.
36 7. If any licensee or other person fails to renew his or her
37 license as provided in this section, the Commission may order the

40 any penalties. Except for a license for which fees are based on the
41 gross revenue of the licensee, failure to renew a license within 30
42 days after the date required by this chapter shall be deemed a
43 surrender of the license.
44 8. The voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not
45 become effective until accepted in the manner provided [in the
-
*SB362*
– 9 –
1 regulations of the Commission.] by the Board. The surrender of a
2 license does not relieve the former licensee of any penalties, fines,
3 fees, taxes or interest due.
4 Sec. 11. NRS 463.370 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 463.370 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and

14 (c) Six and three-quarters percent of all the gross revenue of the
15 licensee which exceeds $134,000 per calendar month.
16 2. Unless the licensee has been operating for less than a full
17 calendar month, the Commission shall charge and collect the fee
18 prescribed in subsection 1, based upon the gross revenue for the
19 preceding calendar month, on or before the 15th day of the
20 following month. Except for the fee based on the first full month of
21 operation, the fee is an estimated payment of the license fee for the
22 third month following the month whose gross revenue is used as its
23 basis.
24 3. When a licensee has been operating for less than a full
25 calendar month, the Commission shall charge and collect the fee
26 prescribed in subsection 1, based on the gross revenue received
27 during that month, on or before the 15th day of the following
28 calendar month of operation. After the first full calendar month of
29 operation, the Commission shall charge and collect the fee based on
30 the gross revenue received during that month, on or before the 15th
31 day of the following calendar month. The payment of the fee due for
32 the first full calendar month of operation must be accompanied by
33 the payment of a fee equal to three times the fee for the first full
34 calendar month. This additional amount is an estimated payment of
35 the license fees for the next 3 calendar months. Thereafter, each
36 license fee must be paid in the manner described in subsection 2.
37 Any deposit held by the Commission on July 1, 1969, must be
38 treated as an advance estimated payment.
39 4. All revenue received from any game or gaming device
40 which is operated on the premises of a licensee, regardless of
41 whether any portion of the revenue is shared with any other person,
42 must be attributed to the licensee for the purposes of this section and
43 counted as part of the gross revenue of the licensee. Any other
44 person who is authorized to receive a share of the revenue from any
45 game or gaming device that is operated on the premises of a licensee
-
*SB362*
– 10 –
1 is liable to the licensee for that person’s proportionate share of the
2 license fees paid by the licensee pursuant to this section and shall
3 remit or credit the full proportionate share to the licensee on or
4 before the 15th day of each calendar month. A licensee is not liable
5 to any other person authorized to receive a share of the licensee’s
6 revenue from any game or gaming device that is operated on the
7 premises of the licensee for that person’s proportionate share of the
8 license fees to be remitted or credited to the licensee by that person
9 pursuant to this section.
10 5. Any person required to pay a fee pursuant to this section
11 shall file with the Commission, on or before the 15th day of each
12 calendar month, a report showing the amount of all gross revenue
13 received during the preceding calendar month. Each report must be
14 accompanied by:
15 (a) The fee due based on the revenue of the month covered by
16 the report; and
17 (b) An adjustment for the difference between the estimated fee
18 previously paid for the month covered by the report, if any, and the
19 fee due for the actual gross revenue earned in that month. If
20 the adjustment is less than zero, a credit must be applied to the
21 estimated fee due with that report.
22 6. If the amount of license fees required to be reported and paid
23 pursuant to this section is later determined to be greater or less than
24 the amount actually reported and paid, the Commission shall:
25 (a) Charge and collect the additional license fees determined to
26 be due, with interest thereon until paid; or
27 (b) Refund any overpayment to the person entitled thereto
28 pursuant to this chapter, with interest thereon.
29  Interest pursuant to paragraph (a) must be computed at the rate
30 prescribed in NRS 17.130 from the first day of the first month
31 following the due date of the additional license fees until paid.
32 Interest pursuant to paragraph (b) must be computed at one-half the
33 rate prescribed in NRS 17.130 from the first day of the first month
34 following the date of overpayment until paid.
35 7. Failure to pay the fees provided for in this section shall be
36 deemed a surrender of the license at the expiration of the period for
37 which the estimated payment of fees has been made, as established
38 in subsection 2.
39 8. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 463.386, the amount
40 of the fee prescribed in subsection 1 must not be prorated.
41 9. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 463.386, if a licensee
42 ceases operation, the Commission shall:
43 (a) Charge and collect the additional license fees determined to
44 be due with interest computed pursuant to paragraph (a) of
45 subsection 6; or
-
*SB362*
– 11 –
1 (b) Refund any overpayment to the licensee with interest
2 computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 6,
3  based upon the gross revenue of the licensee during the last 3
4 months immediately preceding the cessation of operation, or

S.B. 362
SENATE BILL NO. 362–SENATOR BUCK
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to gaming.
(BDR 41-1026)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to gaming; requiring the Nevada Gaming
Commission to adopt certain regulations relating to
gaming; retaining the jurisdiction of the Nevada Gaming
Control Board and the Commission under certain
circumstances; revising provisions relating to certain
institutional investors; revising certain provisions
governing voting by the Commission; authorizing the
Commission to reduce, defer or forgive certain fees under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various provisions governing the licensing and control
2 of gaming in this State. (Chapter 463 of NRS) Existing regulations require each
3 person who is licensed to conduct restricted or nonrestricted gaming and who
4 engages in the issuance of credit, check cashing or the direct mail marketing of
5 gaming opportunities to implement a program related to allowing patrons to self-
6 limit access to such credit, check cashing or direct mail marketing. (Nev. Gaming
7 Comm’n Regs. § 5.170) Section 2 of this bill codifies in statute the requirement for
8 the Commission to adopt regulations to implement such a program and expands the
9 program to include communications through direct marketing by mail, telephone,
10 text message or electronic mail.
11 Existing law provides for the issuance of restricted and nonrestricted licenses to
12 conduct gaming and defines a “nonrestricted license” as, among other things, a
13 state gaming license for, or an operation consisting of, 16 or more slot machines.
14 (NRS 463.0177) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the Commission to adopt
15 regulations and establish the necessary fees for a license to operate a tavern gaming
16 establishment; (2) sets forth the requirements for a tavern gaming establishment;
17 and (3) authorizes a tavern gaming establishment to, among other things, operate 25
18 or fewer gaming devices. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to
-
*SB362*

– 2 –
19 exclude a license for the operation of a tavern gaming establishment from the
20 definition of “nonrestricted license” for purposes of the provisions governing the
21 licensing and control of gaming.
22 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make an
23 investigation and initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Commission if the
24 Board is satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found
25 suitable or found preliminarily suitable or was previously approved for an activity
26 for which Commission approval was required or permitted should have its license,
27 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability limited,
28 conditioned, suspended, revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
29 retains the jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission after a person or entity
30 who is licensed, registered, found suitable or preliminarily found suitable is no
31 longer engaged in the activity or position for which Commission approval was
32 required; and (2) provides that the surrender or attempted surrender of a license,
33 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability is not
34 effective until accepted by the Board. Existing law also provides that a voluntary
35 surrender of a license by a licensee does not become effective until accepted in the
36 manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the Commission. (NRS 463.270)
37 Section 10 of this bill provides instead that such a voluntary surrender does not
38 become effective until accepted in the manner provided by the Board.
39 Existing law defines “interactive gaming” and authorizes certain gaming
40 establishments to obtain a license to operate interactive gaming. (NRS 463.016425,
41 463.750) Section 5 of this bill requires the Commission, with the advice and
42 assistance of the Board, to adopt regulations governing interactive gaming that
43 allow for a sports pool, including the acceptance of wagers on sporting events and
44 other events from patrons located within and outside of this State. Section 7 of this
45 bill revises the definition of “interactive gaming” to include a sports pool, which by
46 definition means the business of accepting wagers on sporting events or other
47 events by any system or method of wagering. (NRS 463.0193) Section 14 of this
48 bill makes a conforming change to exclude interactive gaming from the criminal
49 penalties for accepting, receiving or allowing another to accept or receive a wager
50 from a person physically present in this State. (NRS 465.092, 465.093)
51 Existing law requires certain persons to apply for and obtain a finding of
52 suitability, license or registration from the Nevada Gaming Commission under
53 certain circumstances. (NRS 463.530, 463.585, 463.595, 463.643) Existing
54 regulations define “institutional investor” for certain purposes related to gaming.
55 (Nev. Gaming Comm’n Regs. § 16.010) Section 6 of this bill codifies the definition
56 of institutional investor for certain purposes and prohibits such an investor from
57 becoming eligible to receive or hold a waiver granted by the Commission under
58 certain circumstances.
59 Existing law provides that after a final order of the Board recommending denial
60 of an application for a license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, the
61 Commission may: (1) deny the application; (2) reject the application; (3) remand
62 the matter to the Board for further investigation and reconsideration; or (4) by
63 unanimous vote of the members present, grant the application. (NRS 463.220)
64 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Commission, after receiving a final order of the
65 Board recommending approval of such an application, to deny the application by
66 unanimous vote of the members present.
67 Under existing law, a state of emergency or a declaration of disaster may be
68 proclaimed by the Governor or by resolution of the Legislature if the Governor or
69 Legislature, as applicable, finds that: (1) an attack upon the United States has
70 occurred or is anticipated in the immediate future, or any natural, technological or
71 man-made emergency or disaster of major proportions has actually occurred within
72 this State; and (2) the protection of the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this
73 State requires an invocation of certain additional governmental powers.
-
*SB362*

– 3 –
74 (NRS 414.070) Sections 11-13 of this bill authorize the Commission, in response to
75 a state of emergency or declaration of disaster proclaimed by the Governor or by
76 resolution of the Legislature, to reduce, defer or forgive certain fees charged to a
77 licensee.

41 natural person, and to the licensed gaming establishment, as a
42 business entity, under the name or style therein designated, a state
43 gaming license, or deny the same. The Commission may limit the

2 463.270 1. Subject to the power of the Commission to deny,

27 6. Any person who operates, carries on or exposes for play any

32 as provided in this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in
33 addition to the penalties provided by law, is liable to the State of
34 Nevada for all license fees, taxes and penalties which would have
35 been due upon application for renewal.
36 7. If any licensee or other person fails to renew his or her
37 license as provided in this section, the Commission may order the

40 any penalties. Except for a license for which fees are based on the

3 fees, taxes or interest due.
4 Sec. 11. NRS 463.370 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 463.370 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and

13 exceed $134,000 per calendar month; and
14 (c) Six and three-quarters percent of all the gross revenue of the
15 licensee which exceeds $134,000 per calendar month.
16 2. Unless the licensee has been operating for less than a full
17 calendar month, the Commission shall charge and collect the fee
18 prescribed in subsection 1, based upon the gross revenue for the
19 preceding calendar month, on or before the 15th day of the
20 following month. Except for the fee based on the first full month of
21 operation, the fee is an estimated payment of the license fee for the
22 third month following the month whose gross revenue is used as its
23 basis.
24 3. When a licensee has been operating for less than a full
25 calendar month, the Commission shall charge and collect the fee
26 prescribed in subsection 1, based on the gross revenue received
27 during that month, on or before the 15th day of the following
28 calendar month of operation. After the first full calendar month of
29 operation, the Commission shall charge and collect the fee based on
30 the gross revenue received during that month, on or before the 15th
31 day of the following calendar month. The payment of the fee due for
32 the first full calendar month of operation must be accompanied by
33 the payment of a fee equal to three times the fee for the first full
34 calendar month. This additional amount is an estimated payment of
35 the license fees for the next 3 calendar months. Thereafter, each
36 license fee must be paid in the manner described in subsection 2.
37 Any deposit held by the Commission on July 1, 1969, must be
38 treated as an advance estimated payment.
39 4. All revenue received from any game or gaming device
40 which is operated on the premises of a licensee, regardless of
41 whether any portion of the revenue is shared with any other person,
42 must be attributed to the licensee for the purposes of this section and
43 counted as part of the gross revenue of the licensee. Any other
44 person who is authorized to receive a share of the revenue from any
45 game or gaming device that is operated on the premises of a licensee
-
*SB362*

– 10 –
1 is liable to the licensee for that person’s proportionate share of the
2 license fees paid by the licensee pursuant to this section and shall
3 remit or credit the full proportionate share to the licensee on or
4 before the 15th day of each calendar month. A licensee is not liable
5 to any other person authorized to receive a share of the licensee’s
6 revenue from any game or gaming device that is operated on the
7 premises of the licensee for that person’s proportionate share of the
8 license fees to be remitted or credited to the licensee by that person
9 pursuant to this section.
10 5. Any person required to pay a fee pursuant to this section
11 shall file with the Commission, on or before the 15th day of each
12 calendar month, a report showing the amount of all gross revenue
13 received during the preceding calendar month. Each report must be
14 accompanied by:
15 (a) The fee due based on the revenue of the month covered by
16 the report; and
17 (b) An adjustment for the difference between the estimated fee
18 previously paid for the month covered by the report, if any, and the
19 fee due for the actual gross revenue earned in that month. If
20 the adjustment is less than zero, a credit must be applied to the
21 estimated fee due with that report.
22 6. If the amount of license fees required to be reported and paid
23 pursuant to this section is later determined to be greater or less than
24 the amount actually reported and paid, the Commission shall:
25 (a) Charge and collect the additional license fees determined to
26 be due, with interest thereon until paid; or
27 (b) Refund any overpayment to the person entitled thereto
28 pursuant to this chapter, with interest thereon.
29  Interest pursuant to paragraph (a) must be computed at the rate
30 prescribed in NRS 17.130 from the first day of the first month
31 following the due date of the additional license fees until paid.
32 Interest pursuant to paragraph (b) must be computed at one-half the
33 rate prescribed in NRS 17.130 from the first day of the first month
34 following the date of overpayment until paid.
35 7. Failure to pay the fees provided for in this section shall be
36 deemed a surrender of the license at the expiration of the period for
37 which the estimated payment of fees has been made, as established
38 in subsection 2.
39 8. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 463.386, the amount
40 of the fee prescribed in subsection 1 must not be prorated.
41 9. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 463.386, if a licensee

2 computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 6,
3  based upon the gross revenue of the licensee during the last 3
4 months immediately preceding the cessation of operation, or
5 portions of those last 3 months.
6 10. If in any month, the amount of gross revenue is less than
7 zero, the licensee may offset the loss against gross revenue in
8 succeeding months until the loss has been fully offset.
9 11. If in any month, the amount of the license fee due is less
10 than zero, the licensee is entitled to receive a credit against any
11 license fees due in succeeding months until the credit has been fully
12 offset.
13 12. The Commission may, in response to a state of emergency
14 or declaration of disaster proclaimed by the Governor or by
15 resolution of the Legislature pursuant to NRS 414.070:
16 (a) Reduce any fee required pursuant to this section based on
17 the actual gross gaming revenue generated during the state of
18 emergency or declaration of disaster. The reduction must be
19 proportional to the decrease in revenue experienced by the
20 licensee as determined by the Board.
21 (b) Allow a licensee to defer any monthly payment in an
22 amount and for a duration as determined by the Commission.
23 (c) Forgive the fees accrued if the licensee demonstrates

8 of the fee prescribed in subsection 1 and shall remit or credit his or
