(BDR 5-947)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions relating to
community service ordered for a child who is subject to
the jurisdiction of the juvenile court; revising provisions
relating to the driving privileges of certain children who
are adjudicated delinquent or in need of supervision; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law authorizes a juvenile court to order a child who is
2 subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or the parent or guardian of such a
3 child, or both, to perform community service. (NRS 62E.180) Existing law defines
4 “community service” for the purposes of any such order to include certain public
5 service, work on public projects, supervised work for the benefit of the community
6 or any other work required by the juvenile court. (NRS 62A.060) Section 1 of this
7 bill revises the definition of community service to mean a community-based
8 activity that: (1) facilitates civic engagement, facilitates or enhances connections
9 between the child and his or her community, provides training in life skills or
10 increases the employability of a child; and (2) is designed to achieve certain goals.
11 Under existing law, if a juvenile court orders a child, parent or guardian to
12 perform community service, the community service must be performed for and
13 under the supervising authority of certain public entities or a private nonprofit
14 corporation. (NRS 62E.190) Section 2 of this bill adds a program for which the
15 primary purpose is to build job skills and increase employability to the list of
16 entities under whose supervisory authority a child, parent or guardian is authorized
17 to perform community service.
18 Existing law authorizes or requires the juvenile court to suspend or delay the
19 issuance of the driver’s license of a child who is adjudicated delinquent or in need
20 of supervision under certain circumstances. Under existing law, if a child is already
21 the subject of such an order, the juvenile court must order the additional suspension
22 or delay to apply consecutively with the previous order. (NRS 62E.440, 62E.630,
23 62E.650, 62E.690) Sections 4-7 of this bill remove this requirement.

24 Among other penalties, existing law requires a juvenile court to order a child
25 who is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because the child is a habitual truant
26 to pay a fine or perform community service, or both. (NRS 62E.430) Section 3 of
27 this bill: (1) removes the requirement that the court order the child to pay a fine the
28 first time the child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision; and (2) authorizes
29 the juvenile court to order the child to perform an additional 10 hours of
30 community service for a combined total not to exceed 20 hours in lieu of all or part
31 of the fine ordered by the court.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing juvenile justice.
(BDR 5-947)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions relating to
community service ordered for a child who is subject to
the jurisdiction of the juvenile court; revising provisions
relating to the driving privileges of certain children who
are adjudicated delinquent or in need of supervision; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law authorizes a juvenile court to order a child who is
2 subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or the parent or guardian of such a
3 child, or both, to perform community service. (NRS 62E.180) Existing law defines
4 “community service” for the purposes of any such order to include certain public
5 service, work on public projects, supervised work for the benefit of the community
6 or any other work required by the juvenile court. (NRS 62A.060) Section 1 of this
7 bill revises the definition of community service to mean a community-based
8 activity that: (1) facilitates civic engagement, facilitates or enhances connections
9 between the child and his or her community, provides training in life skills or
10 increases the employability of a child; and (2) is designed to achieve certain goals.
11 Under existing law, if a juvenile court orders a child, parent or guardian to
12 perform community service, the community service must be performed for and
13 under the supervising authority of certain public entities or a private nonprofit
14 corporation. (NRS 62E.190) Section 2 of this bill adds a program for which the
15 primary purpose is to build job skills and increase employability to the list of
16 entities under whose supervisory authority a child, parent or guardian is authorized
17 to perform community service.
18 Existing law authorizes or requires the juvenile court to suspend or delay the
19 issuance of the driver’s license of a child who is adjudicated delinquent or in need
20 of supervision under certain circumstances. Under existing law, if a child is already
21 the subject of such an order, the juvenile court must order the additional suspension
22 or delay to apply consecutively with the previous order. (NRS 62E.440, 62E.630,
23 62E.650, 62E.690) Sections 4-7 of this bill remove this requirement.

24 Among other penalties, existing law requires a juvenile court to order a child
25 who is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because the child is a habitual truant
26 to pay a fine or perform community service, or both. (NRS 62E.430) Section 3 of
27 this bill: (1) removes the requirement that the court order the child to pay a fine the
28 first time the child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision; and (2) authorizes
29 the juvenile court to order the child to perform an additional 10 hours of
30 community service for a combined total not to exceed 20 hours in lieu of all or part
31 of the fine ordered by the court.
