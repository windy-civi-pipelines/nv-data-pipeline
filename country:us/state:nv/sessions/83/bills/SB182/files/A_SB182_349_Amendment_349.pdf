AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain hospitals to establish staffing
committees for technical and service staff; establishing requirements
governing the staffing of certain health care facilities; requiring certain

[health care facilities] hospitals to report [and publish] certain
information relating to staffing; prohibiting certain health care facilities

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain hospitals in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
2 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish a staffing committee, which must consist,
3 in part, of certain nurses who are on the staff of the hospital. (NRS 449.242) Existing law
4 requires a hospital and certain other health care facilities in such counties to develop a
5 documented staffing plan which must include certain items, such as the number of nurses
6 required in each unit of the hospital and protocols for adequately staffing the hospital upon the
7 occurrence of certain events. (NRS 449.2421) If the health care facility is a hospital, existing
8 law requires the staffing committee established for the hospital to develop the staffing plan.
9 (NRS 442.242) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill require each hospital that is required to establish a
10 staffing committee for nurses to additionally establish a technical staffing committee and a
11 service staffing committee, respectively, to represent the technical and service workers of the
12 hospital. Sections 18-20 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to existing staffing
13 committees for nurses as “nursing staffing committees.” Sections 5, 6 and 18 require the
14 technical staffing committee, the service staffing committee and the nursing staffing
15 committee to collaborate to develop the documented staffing plan for the hospital. Section 19
16 requires a documented staffing plan to contain certain provisions relating to the adequate
17 staffing of technical and service workers. Section 23 of this bill requires a hospital that has
18 established a technical staffing committee and a service staffing committee to include the
19 members of those committees on the hospital’s committee on workplace safety, which

Senate Amendment No. 349 to Senate Bill No. 182 Page 4
20 performs certain duties relating to the prevention of workplace violence at the hospital. (NRS
21 618.7312)
22 Existing law requires each hospital that is required to establish a nursing staffing
23 committee to report annually to the Legislature concerning the establishment of the nursing
24 staffing committee, the activities and progress of the nursing staffing committee and a
25 determination of the efficacy of the nursing staffing committee. (NRS 449.242) Sections 7
26 and 18 of this bill require that report to additionally include such information for the technical
27 staffing committee and the service staffing committee.
28 Section 8 of this bill establishes the maximum ratios for the number of patients that may
29 be assigned to a direct care nurse at one time in certain hospitals in a county whose population
30 is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). The ratios established by section
31 8 vary based on the unit of the hospital to which a direct care nurse is assigned. Section 8 also
32 establishes [the maximum ratios for the number of patients that may be assigned to a certified
33 nursing assistant, in any unit, in] certain other staffing requirements for certain hospitals in
34 a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), [at one
35 time.] including maximum ratios for the number of patients that may be assigned to a
36 certified nursing assistant, in any unit, at one time. Section 19 requires the documented
37 staffing plan of a hospital to provide for staffing in accordance with the maximum ratios of
38 patients to direct care nurses established by section 8. Section 19 also requires such a
39 documented staffing plan to provide for additional compensation for nurses who perform
40 certain duties. Section 9 of this bill requires a hospital to maintain certain records containing
41 information relevant for measuring the compliance of the hospital with the nurse-to-patient
42 ratios established by section 8.
43 Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes hospitals which are required to establish a nursing
44 staffing committee and adhere to the maximum ratios prescribed in section 8 to deviate
45 from those maximum ratios and the documented staffing plan of the hospital during a
46 state of emergency. Section 9.5 establishes certain procedures that must be followed by
47 the hospital and the nursing staffing committee upon such a deviation.
48 Sections 12 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
49 the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a health care facility that fails to
50 comply with the requirements of this bill in the same manner as violations of other
51 requirements governing health care facilities. Section 22 of this bill requires the Division to
52 establish: (1) procedures for random visits to health care facilities to ensure compliance with
53 the requirements of this bill, where applicable, and certain other requirements governing the
54 staffing of health care facilities; (2) an accessible and confidential system that allows certain
55 staff of a health care facility to report a violation of those requirements; and (3) procedures for
56 timely investigating and resolving such a report. Section 10 of this bill additionally authorizes
57 the Labor Commissioner to take certain actions to ensure that a health care facility complies
58 with the requirements of this bill, where applicable, and certain other requirements relating to
59 the staffing of health care facilities. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care facility from
60 retaliating against an employee of the facility for reporting a violation to the Division or the
61 Labor Commissioner.
62 Existing law requires the establishment of a system for rating certain health care facilities
63 located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more on their compliance with
64 requirements governing staffing. (NRS 449.2425) Section 21 of this bill requires the Division
65 to assign a new rating to a facility after an inspection or investigation conducted pursuant to
66 section 22.
67 Sections 2-4 of this bill define certain terms relating to the staffing of health care
68 facilities, and section 17 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Sections
69 11 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the applicability and enforcement
70 of sections 2-10.
71 [Existing law requires the operator of a facility for skilled nursing to conspicuously post
72 his or her license to operate the facility and certain information relating to the management of
73 the facility. (NRS 449.184) Section 14 of this bill additionally requires a skilled nursing
74 facility to post on the Internet website of the facility and submit to the Division a monthly
75 report concerning the ratio of licensed nurses to patients at the facility for skilled nursing.]

13 untimely;
14 (2) The process for filing a complaint with the Division or any other

16 would be untimely to address the concerns of the licensed nurse or certified nursing
17 assistant in refusing a work assignment; and
