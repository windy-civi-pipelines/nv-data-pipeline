Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain hospitals in a county whose population is 100,000
2 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish a staffing committee,
3 which must consist, in part, of certain nurses who are on the staff of the hospital.
4 (NRS 449.242) Existing law requires a hospital and certain other health care
5 facilities in such counties to develop a documented staffing plan which must
6 include certain items, such as the number of nurses required in each unit of the
7 hospital and protocols for adequately staffing the hospital upon the occurrence of
8 certain events. (NRS 449.2421) If the health care facility is a hospital, existing law
9 requires the staffing committee established for the hospital to develop the staffing
10 plan. (NRS 442.242) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill require each hospital that is
11 required to establish a staffing committee for nurses to additionally establish a
12 technical staffing committee and a service staffing committee, respectively, to
13 represent the technical and service workers of the hospital. Sections 18-20 of this
-
*SB182*

– 2 –
14 bill make conforming changes to refer to existing staffing committees for nurses as
15 “nursing staffing committees.” Sections 5, 6 and 18 require the technical staffing
16 committee, the service staffing committee and the nursing staffing committee to
17 collaborate to develop the documented staffing plan for the hospital. Section 19
18 requires a documented staffing plan to contain certain provisions relating to the
19 adequate staffing of technical and service workers. Section 23 of this bill requires a
20 hospital that has established a technical staffing committee and a service staffing
21 committee to include the members of those committees on the hospital’s committee
22 on workplace safety, which performs certain duties relating to the prevention of
23 workplace violence at the hospital. (NRS 618.7312)
24 Existing law requires each hospital that is required to establish a nursing
25 staffing committee to report annually to the Legislature concerning the
26 establishment of the nursing staffing committee, the activities and progress of the
27 nursing staffing committee and a determination of the efficacy of the nursing
28 staffing committee. (NRS 449.242) Sections 7 and 18 of this bill require that report
29 to additionally include such information for the technical staffing committee and
30 the service staffing committee.
31 Section 8 of this bill establishes the maximum ratios for the number of patients
32 that may be assigned to a direct care nurse at one time in certain hospitals in a
33 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
34 Counties). The ratios established by section 8 vary based on the unit of the hospital
35 to which a direct care nurse is assigned. Section 8 also establishes the maximum
36 ratios for the number of patients that may be assigned to a certified nursing
37 assistant, in any unit, in certain hospitals in a county whose population is 100,000
38 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), at one time. Section 19 requires
39 the documented staffing plan of a hospital to provide for staffing in accordance
40 with the maximum ratios of patients to direct care nurses established by section 8.
41 Section 19 also requires such a documented staffing plan to provide for additional
42 compensation for nurses who perform certain duties. Section 9 of this bill requires
43 a hospital to maintain certain records containing information relevant for measuring
44 the compliance of the hospital with the nurse-to-patient ratios established by
45 section 8.
46 Sections 12 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
47 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a health care
48 facility that fails to comply with the requirements of this bill in the same manner as
49 violations of other requirements governing health care facilities. Section 22 of this
50 bill requires the Division to establish: (1) procedures for random visits to health
51 care facilities to ensure compliance with the requirements of this bill, where
52 applicable, and certain other requirements governing the staffing of health care
53 facilities; (2) an accessible and confidential system that allows certain staff of a
54 health care facility to report a violation of those requirements; and (3) procedures
55 for timely investigating and resolving such a report. Section 10 of this bill
56 additionally authorizes the Labor Commissioner to take certain actions to ensure
57 that a health care facility complies with the requirements of this bill, where
58 applicable, and certain other requirements relating to the staffing of health care
59 facilities. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care facility from retaliating
60 against an employee of the facility for reporting a violation to the Division or the
61 Labor Commissioner.
62 Existing law requires the establishment of a system for rating certain health
63 care facilities located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more on their
64 compliance with requirements governing staffing. (NRS 449.2425) Section 21 of
65 this bill requires the Division to assign a new rating to a facility after an inspection
66 or investigation conducted pursuant to section 22.
67 Sections 2-4 of this bill define certain terms relating to the staffing of health
68 care facilities, and section 17 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
-
*SB182*

– 3 –
69 definitions. Sections 11 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
70 applicability and enforcement of sections 2-10.
71 Existing law requires the operator of a facility for skilled nursing to
72 conspicuously post his or her license to operate the facility and certain information
73 relating to the management of the facility. (NRS 449.184) Section 14 of this bill
74 additionally requires a skilled nursing facility to post on the Internet website of the
75 facility and submit to the Division a monthly report concerning the ratio of licensed
76 nurses to patients at the facility for skilled nursing.
