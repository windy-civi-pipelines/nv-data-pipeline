Senate Bill No. 182–Senator Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain hospitals to
establish staffing committees for technical and service staff;
establishing requirements governing the staffing of certain
health care facilities; requiring certain hospitals to keep
certain records relating to staffing; requiring certain hospitals
to report certain information relating to staffing; prohibiting
certain health care facilities from taking certain retaliatory
actions; providing for certain actions to investigate and
correct certain violations relating to staffing; providing
administrative penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain hospitals in a county whose population is 100,000
or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish a staffing committee,
which must consist, in part, of certain nurses who are on the staff of the hospital.
(NRS 449.242) Existing law requires a hospital and certain other health care
facilities in such counties to develop a documented staffing plan which must
include certain items, such as the number of nurses required in each unit of the
hospital and protocols for adequately staffing the hospital upon the occurrence of
certain events. (NRS 449.2421) If the health care facility is a hospital, existing law
requires the staffing committee established for the hospital to develop the staffing
plan. (NRS 442.242) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill require each hospital that is
required to establish a staffing committee for nurses to additionally establish a
technical staffing committee and a service staffing committee, respectively, to
represent the technical and service workers of the hospital. Sections 18-20 of this
bill make conforming changes to refer to existing staffing committees for nurses as
“nursing staffing committees.” Sections 5, 6 and 18 require the technical staffing
committee, the service staffing committee and the nursing staffing committee to
collaborate to develop the documented staffing plan for the hospital. Section 19
requires a documented staffing plan to contain certain provisions relating to the
adequate staffing of technical and service workers. Section 23 of this bill requires a
hospital that has established a technical staffing committee and a service staffing
committee to include the members of those committees on the hospital’s committee
on workplace safety, which performs certain duties relating to the prevention of
workplace violence at the hospital. (NRS 618.7312)
Existing law requires each hospital that is required to establish a nursing
staffing committee to report annually to the Legislature concerning the
establishment of the nursing staffing committee, the activities and progress of the
nursing staffing committee and a determination of the efficacy of the nursing
staffing committee. (NRS 449.242) Sections 7 and 18 of this bill require that report
to additionally include such information for the technical staffing committee and
the service staffing committee.
Section 8 of this bill establishes the maximum ratios for the number of patients
that may be assigned to a direct care nurse at one time in certain hospitals in a
county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
Counties). The ratios established by section 8 vary based on the unit of the hospital
to which a direct care nurse is assigned. Section 8 also establishes certain other
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
staffing requirements for certain hospitals in a county whose population is 100,000
or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), including maximum ratios for the
number of patients that may be assigned to a certified nursing assistant, in any unit,
at one time. Section 19 requires the documented staffing plan of a hospital to
provide for staffing in accordance with the maximum ratios of patients to direct
care nurses established by section 8. Section 19 also requires such a documented
staffing plan to provide for additional compensation for nurses who perform certain
duties. Section 9 of this bill requires a hospital to maintain certain records
containing information relevant for measuring the compliance of the hospital with
the nurse-to-patient ratios established by section 8.
Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes hospitals which are required to establish a
nursing staffing committee and adhere to the maximum ratios prescribed in section
8 to deviate from those maximum ratios and the documented staffing plan of the
hospital during a state of emergency. Section 9.5 establishes certain procedures that
must be followed by the hospital and the nursing staffing committee upon such a
deviation.
Sections 12 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a health care
facility that fails to comply with the requirements of this bill in the same manner as
violations of other requirements governing health care facilities. Section 22 of this
bill requires the Division to establish: (1) procedures for random visits to health
care facilities to ensure compliance with the requirements of this bill, where
applicable, and certain other requirements governing the staffing of health care
facilities; (2) an accessible and confidential system that allows certain staff of a
health care facility to report a violation of those requirements; and (3) procedures
for timely investigating and resolving such a report. Section 10 of this bill
additionally authorizes the Labor Commissioner to take certain actions to ensure
that a health care facility complies with the requirements of this bill, where
applicable, and certain other requirements relating to the staffing of health care
facilities. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care facility from retaliating
against an employee of the facility for reporting a violation to the Division or the
Labor Commissioner.
Existing law requires the establishment of a system for rating certain health
care facilities located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more on their
compliance with requirements governing staffing. (NRS 449.2425) Section 21 of
this bill requires the Division to assign a new rating to a facility after an inspection
or investigation conducted pursuant to section 22.
Sections 2-4 of this bill define certain terms relating to the staffing of health
care facilities, and section 17 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
definitions. Sections 11 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
applicability and enforcement of sections 2-10.
