EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to towns; eliminating the requirement that a
member of a citizens’ advisory council of a town or
certain town advisory boards be a qualified elector; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that in a county having a population of less than 100,000
2 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) which has not
3 elected to accept the provisions of the Unincorporated Town Government Law
4 (NRS 269.500-269.625), the board of county commissioners may, under certain
5 circumstances, by ordinance create a citizens’ advisory council to act in an advisory
6 and liaison capacity with respect to governing the affairs of an unincorporated
7 town. (NRS 269.011, 269.024, 269.0242) Any such citizens’ advisory council must
8 consist of not fewer than three nor more than five members, each of whom must be
9 a resident and qualified elector in the town. (NRS 269.0242) Section 1 of this bill
10 eliminates the requirement that a member of such a citizens’ advisory council be a
11 qualified elector. Section 1 further requires that a member of such a citizens’
12 advisory council be: (1) a resident of the town; and (2) a citizen of the United States
13 or lawfully entitled to reside in the United States.
14 Existing law provides that the Unincorporated Town Government Law applies
15 in a county having a population of 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
16 Counties) and in any other county in which the board of county commissioners has
17 adopted by ordinance, the Unincorporated Town Government Law. (NRS 269.530)
-
*SB262_R1*

– 2 –
18 Pursuant to the Unincorporated Town Government Law, the board of county
19 commissioners must provide for a town advisory board in an ordinance which
20 establishes an unincorporated town. Such a town advisory board must consist of
21 three or five qualified electors who are residents of the unincorporated town. (NRS
22 269.576, 269.577) Existing law further authorizes the board of county
23 commissioners of any county, by resolution, to designate one or more town services
24 to be within the power of a town advisory board to manage. (NRS 269.580) If the
25 board of county commissioners has not made such a designation, sections 2 and 3
26 of this bill eliminate the requirement that a member of such a town advisory board
27 be a qualified elector. Instead, sections 2 and 3 require that a member of such a
28 town advisory board be: (1) a resident of the unincorporated town; and (2) a citizen
29 of the United States or lawfully entitled to reside in the United States.
30 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise the declaration of
31 candidacy that must be filed by a candidate for the position of a town advisory
32 board if the members of the town advisory board are not required to be qualified
33 electors pursuant to sections 2 and 3 because the board of county commissioners
34 has not designated one or more services to be within the power of the town
35 advisory board to manage.

22 been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
23 for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
24 provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of
25 subsection 4:
26 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post
27 office box unless a street address has not been assigned to his or her

38 4. If the candidate executes an oath or affirmation under
39 penalty of perjury stating that the candidate is unable to present to
40 the filing officer the proof of residency required by subsection 3
41 because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s
42 residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s

1 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a

9 candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to
10 verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively,
11 resides in accordance with NRS 281.050.
12 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity
13 and residency provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or

15 (a) May not be withheld from the public; and
16 (b) Must not contain the social security number, driver’s license

21 the purposes of a proceeding pursuant to NRS 293.182. Service of
22 such process must first be attempted at the appropriate address as
23 specified by the candidate in the declaration of candidacy. If the
24 candidate cannot be served at that address, service must be made by
25 personally delivering to and leaving with the filing officer duplicate
26 copies of the process. The filing officer shall immediately send, by
27 registered or certified mail, one of the copies to the candidate at the
28 specified address, unless the candidate has designated in writing to
29 the filing officer a different address for that purpose, in which case
30 the filing officer shall mail the copy to the last address so
31 designated.
32 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that
33 a candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
34 civil rights restored, the filing officer:

36 candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
37 candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and

41 person other than the Secretary of State.
42 8. The receipt of information by the Attorney General or
43 district attorney pursuant to subsection 7 must be treated as a
44 challenge of a candidate pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 of NRS
45 293.182 to which the provisions of NRS 293.2045 apply.
