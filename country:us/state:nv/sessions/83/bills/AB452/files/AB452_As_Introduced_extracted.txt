EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring certain electric
utilities to include a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism
in certain plans the utility is required to submit to the
Public Utilities Commission of Nevada; establishing
certain requirements for a cost-sharing adjustment
mechanism; revising provisions governing certain
quarterly and annual adjustments to a required general
rate application; revising provisions governing the review
of certain plans by the Commission; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility to submit to the Public Utilities
2 Commission of Nevada every 3 years an integrated resource plan to increase the
3 utility’s supply of electricity or decrease the demands made on its system by its
4 customers. (NRS 704.741) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require certain electric
5 utilities to include in such a plan a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the
6 recovery of costs for purchased fuel and purchased power and the sharing of such
7 costs between an electric utility and its customers. Section 1 also establishes certain
8 requirements for such a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism. Section 1 requires a
9 cost-sharing adjustment mechanism to be based on a forecasted estimate of costs
10 for purchased fuel and purchased power which is made by the utility, and requires
11 the utility to provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to: (1) the
12 Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission; (2) the Bureau of Consumer
13 Protection in the Office of the Attorney General; and (3) any intervenor who signs a
14 nondisclosure agreement, including the Office of Economic Development. Section
15 1 provides for the calculation of costs or savings based on the forecasted estimate
16 and authorizes the percentage of costs or savings which are shared between the
17 utility and its customers to be symmetrical or asymmetrical as the Commission
18 deems necessary to incentivize the utility to manage costs effectively. Section 1
-
*AB452*
– 2 –
19 requires the utility to: (1) include in its plan the financial strategy employed by the
20 utility to reduce risks which are associated with fluctuations in the market; and (2)
21 propose an annual cap on the cumulative amount of cost-sharing adjustments.
22 Existing law requires certain electric utilities to file a general rate application
23 once every 36 months and to file certain quarterly and annual adjustments. (NRS
24 704.110, 704.187) Section 2 of this bill requires the quarterly and annual
25 adjustments to take into account any cost-sharing adjustments made pursuant to
26 section 1. Existing law requires the Commission to issue certain orders to accept or
27 modify, or deem inadequate any portion of, the plan filed pursuant to section 4
28 which relates to the energy supply plan of the utility within 135 days after a utility
29 has filed the plan. (NRS 704.751) Section 5 of this bill requires the Commission to
30 issue such orders within 180 days after a utility has filed: (1) the plan; and (2) any
31 update of a portion of the plan that the Commission requires. Sections 1 and 3 of
32 this bill make section 1 applicable to certain electric utilities.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An electric utility shall include as part of the portions of
4 the plan required by NRS 704.741 relating to the energy supply
5 plan for the utility for the 3 years covered by the plan and as part
6 of any update to those portions that the Commission may require:
7 (a) A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of
8 costs for purchased fuel and purchased power that meets the
9 requirements of this section; and
10 (b) The financial strategy employed by the utility, which must
11 be approved by the Commission, to reduce risks which are
12 associated with fluctuations in the market for purchased fuel and
13 purchased power.
14 2. A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism must be based on a
15 forecasted estimate of costs for purchased fuel and purchased
16 power which is made by the electric utility. An electric utility shall
17 provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to:
18 (a) The Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission;
19 (b) The Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
20 Attorney General; and
21 (c) Any intervenor who signs a nondisclosure agreement,
22 including, without limitation, the Office of Economic
23 Development.
24 3. A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism must incorporate
25 the deadband which is calculated pursuant to subsection 10 of
26 NRS 704.110. Any costs of purchased fuel and purchased power,
27 or savings on such costs, that are above or below the deadband
28 must be shared between the electric utility and the customers of
29 the utility as described in subsections 4 and 5.
-
*AB452*
– 3 –
1 4. The percentage of costs of purchased fuel and purchased
2 power, or savings on such costs, that are shared between an
3 electric utility and its customers pursuant to subsection 3 may be
4 symmetrical or asymmetrical as the Commission deems necessary
5 to incentivize the utility to manage costs effectively.
6 5. An electric utility shall propose an annual cap on the
7 cumulative amount of cost-sharing adjustments pursuant to
8 subsections 3 and 4, whether costs or savings, which must be
9 based on a percentage of the authorized return on the equity of the
10 electric utility and expressed in basis points representing one-
11 hundredth of a percent. If the earnings of the electric utility are:
12 (a) Below the cap, the utility may recover excess costs
13 pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 until the cap is reached; or
14 (b) Above the cap, the utility shall refund to the customers of
15 the utility the savings pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 until the cap
16 is reached.
17 6. As used in this section:
18 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a
19 mechanism that shares the risk of purchased fuel and purchased
20 power costs between an electric utility and its customers.
21 (b) “Deadband” means a range around a performance target
22 within which the performance of an electric utility is deemed
23 reasonable, for which performance the electric utility does not
24 receive a reward or penalty and which recognizes the inherent
25 uncertainty or margin of error in measuring and calculating a
26 given benchmark or baseline.
27 (c) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
28 NRS 704.187.
29 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
31 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may
32 otherwise be provided by the Commission pursuant to NRS
33 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
34 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
35 make changes in any schedule, including, without limitation,
36 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
37 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
38 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
39 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
40 application and the application is a general rate application or an
41 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
42 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.
43 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public
44 utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in
45 any schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the
-
*AB452*
– 4 –
1 date on which the application is filed, issue a written order
2 approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed
3 changes.
4 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
5 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
6 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
7 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
8 which data were available when the application was prepared [.] ,
9 including, without limitation, the results of any cost-sharing
10 adjustment mechanism pursuant to section 1 of this act, if
11 applicable. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in
12 determining whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates,
13 the Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
14 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
15 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
16 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
17 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
18 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
19 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
20 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
21 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
22 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
23 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
24 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
25 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
26 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
27 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
28 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
29 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
30 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
31 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
32 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
33 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
34 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
35 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
36 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
37 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
38 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
39 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
40 June 2019; and
41 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
42 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
43 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
44 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
45 counties shall file a general rate application:
-
*AB452*
– 5 –
1 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
2 June 2020; and
3 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
4 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
5 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
6 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
7 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
8 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
9 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
10 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
11 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
12 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
13 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
14 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
15 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
16 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
17 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
18 paragraph for either service.
19 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
20 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
21 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
22 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
23 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
24 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
25 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
26 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
27 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
28 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
29 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
30 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
31 paragraph for either service.
32  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
33 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
34 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
35 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
36 rates.
37 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
38 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
39 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
40 of all expected changes in circumstances [.] , including, without
41 limitation, the results of any cost-sharing adjustment mechanism
42 pursuant to section 1 of this act, if applicable. If such a statement is
43 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
44 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
45 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
-
*AB452*
– 6 –
1 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
2 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
3 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
4 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
5 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
6 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
7 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
8 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
9 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
10 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
11 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
12 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
13 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
14 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
15 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
16 utility has met its burden of proof:
17 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
18 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
19 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
20 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
21 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
22 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
23 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
24 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
25 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
26 subsection 3.
27 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
28 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
29 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
30 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
31 approved by the Commission.
32 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
33 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
34 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
35 Commission another general rate application until all pending
36 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
37 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
38 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
39 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
40 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
41 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
42 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
43 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
44 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
45 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
-
*AB452*
– 7 –
1 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
2 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
3 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
4 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
5 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
6 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
7 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
8 subsection do not apply to:
9 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
10 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
11 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
12 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
13 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
14 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
15 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
16 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
17 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
18 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
19 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
20 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
21 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
22 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
23 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
24 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
25 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
26 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
27 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
28 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
29 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
30 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
31 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
32 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
33 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
34 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
35 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
36 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
37 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
38 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
39 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
40 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
41 NRS 704.069.
42 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
43 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
44 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
45 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
-
*AB452*
– 8 –
1 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
2 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
3 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
4 required by this paragraph:
5 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
6 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
7 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
8 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
9 704.188; and
10 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
11 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
12 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
13 and as a percentage;
14 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
15 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
16 dollars and as a percentage;
17 (III) A statement that customers may send written
18 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
19 Commission;
20 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
21 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
22 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
23 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
24 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
25 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
26 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
27 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
28 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
29 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
30 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
31 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
32 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
33 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
34 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
35 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
36 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
37 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
38 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
39 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
40 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
41 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
42 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
43 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
44 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
45 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
-
*AB452*
– 9 –
1 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
2 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
3 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates , in compliance with
4 section 1 of this act, on a quarterly basis based on changes in the
5 electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased fuel or purchased
6 power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a quarterly basis, an
7 electric utility may request approval from the Commission to make
8 quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment
9 [.] in compliance with section 1 of this act. The Commission shall
10 approve or deny such a request not later than 120 days after the
11 application is filed with the Commission. The Commission may
12 approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
13 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a
14 request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy
15 accounting adjustment of an electric utility pursuant to this
16 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
17 accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-hour
18 of electricity. If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account
19 varies by less than 5 percent from the electric utility’s annual
20 recorded costs for purchased fuel or purchased power which are
21 used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy
22 accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of
23 electricity.
24 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
25 must comply with section 1 of this act and is subject to the
26 following requirements:
27 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
28 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
29 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
30 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
31 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
32 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
33 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
34 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
35 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
36 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
37 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
38 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
39 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
40 NRS 704.069.
41 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
42 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
43 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
44 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
45 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
-
*AB452*
– 10 –
1 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
2 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
3 required by this paragraph:
4 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
5 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
6 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
7 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
8 704.188; and
9 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
10 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
11 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
12 and as a percentage;
13 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
14 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
15 dollars and as a percentage;
16 (III) A statement that customers may send written
17 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
18 Commission;
19 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
20 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
21 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
22 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
23 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
24 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
25 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
26 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
27 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 and in
28 compliance with section 1 of this act with the Commission. The
29 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application is subject
30 to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS
31 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to
32 subsection 1 of NRS 704.069. The annual deferred energy
33 accounting adjustment application must contain the calculations
34 and a justification which supports any cost-sharing adjustment
35 made pursuant to section 1 of this act, including, without
36 limitation:
37 (1) The forecasted quarterly rates and actual quarterly
38 rates;
39 (2) The quarterly amount of any cost-sharing adjustments
40 and the annual cumulative amount of any cost-sharing
41 adjustments; and
42 (3) The calculation of any cap on the annual cumulative
43 amount of any cost-sharing adjustments.
44 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
45 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
-
*AB452*
– 11 –
1 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
2 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
3 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
4 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
5 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
6 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
7 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
8 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
9 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
10 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
11 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
12 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
13 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
14 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
15 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
16 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
17 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
18 application were not reasonable or prudent.
19 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
20 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
21 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
22 electric utility shall:
23 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
24 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
25 and rate design; and
26 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
27 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
28 rate application.
29 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
30 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
31 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
32 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
33 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
34 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
35 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
36 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
37 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may

A.B. 452
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 452–ASSEMBLYMEMBER BROWN-MAY
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public utilities.
(BDR 58-572)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring certain electric
utilities to include a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism
in certain plans the utility is required to submit to the
Public Utilities Commission of Nevada; establishing
certain requirements for a cost-sharing adjustment
mechanism; revising provisions governing certain
quarterly and annual adjustments to a required general
rate application; revising provisions governing the review
of certain plans by the Commission; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each electric utility to submit to the Public Utilities
2 Commission of Nevada every 3 years an integrated resource plan to increase the
3 utility’s supply of electricity or decrease the demands made on its system by its
4 customers. (NRS 704.741) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require certain electric
5 utilities to include in such a plan a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the
6 recovery of costs for purchased fuel and purchased power and the sharing of such
7 costs between an electric utility and its customers. Section 1 also establishes certain
8 requirements for such a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism. Section 1 requires a
9 cost-sharing adjustment mechanism to be based on a forecasted estimate of costs
10 for purchased fuel and purchased power which is made by the utility, and requires
11 the utility to provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to: (1) the
12 Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission; (2) the Bureau of Consumer
13 Protection in the Office of the Attorney General; and (3) any intervenor who signs a
14 nondisclosure agreement, including the Office of Economic Development. Section
15 1 provides for the calculation of costs or savings based on the forecasted estimate
16 and authorizes the percentage of costs or savings which are shared between the
17 utility and its customers to be symmetrical or asymmetrical as the Commission
18 deems necessary to incentivize the utility to manage costs effectively. Section 1
-
*AB452*

– 2 –
19 requires the utility to: (1) include in its plan the financial strategy employed by the
20 utility to reduce risks which are associated with fluctuations in the market; and (2)
21 propose an annual cap on the cumulative amount of cost-sharing adjustments.
22 Existing law requires certain electric utilities to file a general rate application
23 once every 36 months and to file certain quarterly and annual adjustments. (NRS
24 704.110, 704.187) Section 2 of this bill requires the quarterly and annual
25 adjustments to take into account any cost-sharing adjustments made pursuant to
26 section 1. Existing law requires the Commission to issue certain orders to accept or
27 modify, or deem inadequate any portion of, the plan filed pursuant to section 4
28 which relates to the energy supply plan of the utility within 135 days after a utility
29 has filed the plan. (NRS 704.751) Section 5 of this bill requires the Commission to
30 issue such orders within 180 days after a utility has filed: (1) the plan; and (2) any
31 update of a portion of the plan that the Commission requires. Sections 1 and 3 of
32 this bill make section 1 applicable to certain electric utilities.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An electric utility shall include as part of the portions of
4 the plan required by NRS 704.741 relating to the energy supply
5 plan for the utility for the 3 years covered by the plan and as part
6 of any update to those portions that the Commission may require:
7 (a) A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of
8 costs for purchased fuel and purchased power that meets the
9 requirements of this section; and
10 (b) The financial strategy employed by the utility, which must
11 be approved by the Commission, to reduce risks which are
12 associated with fluctuations in the market for purchased fuel and
13 purchased power.
14 2. A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism must be based on a
15 forecasted estimate of costs for purchased fuel and purchased
16 power which is made by the electric utility. An electric utility shall
17 provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to:
18 (a) The Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission;
19 (b) The Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
20 Attorney General; and
21 (c) Any intervenor who signs a nondisclosure agreement,
22 including, without limitation, the Office of Economic
23 Development.
24 3. A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism must incorporate
25 the deadband which is calculated pursuant to subsection 10 of
26 NRS 704.110. Any costs of purchased fuel and purchased power,
27 or savings on such costs, that are above or below the deadband
28 must be shared between the electric utility and the customers of
29 the utility as described in subsections 4 and 5.
-
*AB452*

– 3 –
1 4. The percentage of costs of purchased fuel and purchased
2 power, or savings on such costs, that are shared between an
3 electric utility and its customers pursuant to subsection 3 may be
4 symmetrical or asymmetrical as the Commission deems necessary
5 to incentivize the utility to manage costs effectively.
6 5. An electric utility shall propose an annual cap on the
7 cumulative amount of cost-sharing adjustments pursuant to
8 subsections 3 and 4, whether costs or savings, which must be
9 based on a percentage of the authorized return on the equity of the
10 electric utility and expressed in basis points representing one-
11 hundredth of a percent. If the earnings of the electric utility are:
12 (a) Below the cap, the utility may recover excess costs
13 pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 until the cap is reached; or
14 (b) Above the cap, the utility shall refund to the customers of
15 the utility the savings pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 until the cap
16 is reached.
17 6. As used in this section:
18 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a
19 mechanism that shares the risk of purchased fuel and purchased
20 power costs between an electric utility and its customers.
21 (b) “Deadband” means a range around a performance target
22 within which the performance of an electric utility is deemed
23 reasonable, for which performance the electric utility does not
24 receive a reward or penalty and which recognizes the inherent
25 uncertainty or margin of error in measuring and calculating a
26 given benchmark or baseline.
27 (c) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
28 NRS 704.187.
29 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
31 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may
32 otherwise be provided by the Commission pursuant to NRS
33 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
34 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
35 make changes in any schedule, including, without limitation,
36 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
37 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
38 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
39 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
40 application and the application is a general rate application or an
41 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
42 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.
43 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public
44 utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in
45 any schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the
-
*AB452*

– 4 –
1 date on which the application is filed, issue a written order
2 approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed
3 changes.
4 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
5 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
6 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
7 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
8 which data were available when the application was prepared [.] ,
9 including, without limitation, the results of any cost-sharing
10 adjustment mechanism pursuant to section 1 of this act, if
11 applicable. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in
12 determining whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates,
13 the Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
14 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
15 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
16 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
17 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
18 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
19 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
20 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
21 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
22 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
23 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
24 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
25 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
26 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
27 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
28 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
29 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
30 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
31 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
32 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
33 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
34 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
35 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
36 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
37 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
38 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
39 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
40 June 2019; and
41 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
42 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
43 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
44 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
45 counties shall file a general rate application:
-
*AB452*

– 5 –
1 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
2 June 2020; and
3 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
4 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
5 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
6 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
7 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
8 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
9 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
10 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
11 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
12 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
13 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
14 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
15 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
16 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
17 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
18 paragraph for either service.
19 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
20 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
21 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
22 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
23 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
24 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
25 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
26 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
27 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
28 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
29 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
30 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
31 paragraph for either service.
32  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
33 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
34 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
35 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
36 rates.
37 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
38 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
39 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
40 of all expected changes in circumstances [.] , including, without
41 limitation, the results of any cost-sharing adjustment mechanism
42 pursuant to section 1 of this act, if applicable. If such a statement is
43 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
44 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
45 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
-
*AB452*

– 6 –
1 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
2 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
3 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
4 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
5 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
6 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
7 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
8 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
9 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
10 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
11 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
12 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
13 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
14 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
15 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
16 utility has met its burden of proof:
17 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
18 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
19 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
20 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
21 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
22 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
23 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
24 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
25 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
26 subsection 3.
27 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
28 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
29 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
30 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
31 approved by the Commission.
32 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
33 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
34 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
35 Commission another general rate application until all pending
36 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
37 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
38 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
39 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
40 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
41 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
42 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
43 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
44 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
45 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
-
*AB452*

– 7 –
1 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
2 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
3 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
4 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
5 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
6 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
7 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
8 subsection do not apply to:
9 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
10 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
11 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
12 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
13 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
14 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
15 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
16 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
17 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
18 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
19 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
20 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
21 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
22 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
23 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
24 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
25 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
26 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
27 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
28 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
29 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
30 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
31 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
32 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
33 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
34 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
35 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
36 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
37 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
38 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
39 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
40 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
41 NRS 704.069.
42 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
43 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
44 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
45 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
-
*AB452*

– 8 –
1 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
2 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
3 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
4 required by this paragraph:
5 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
6 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
7 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
8 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
9 704.188; and
10 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
11 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
12 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
13 and as a percentage;
14 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
15 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
16 dollars and as a percentage;
17 (III) A statement that customers may send written
18 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
19 Commission;
20 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
21 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
22 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
23 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
24 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
25 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
26 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
27 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
28 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
29 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
30 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
31 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
32 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
33 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
34 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
35 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
36 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
37 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
38 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
39 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
40 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
41 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
42 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
43 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
44 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
45 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
-
*AB452*

– 9 –
1 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
2 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
3 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates , in compliance with
4 section 1 of this act, on a quarterly basis based on changes in the
5 electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased fuel or purchased
6 power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a quarterly basis, an
7 electric utility may request approval from the Commission to make
8 quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment
9 [.] in compliance with section 1 of this act. The Commission shall
10 approve or deny such a request not later than 120 days after the
11 application is filed with the Commission. The Commission may
12 approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
13 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a
14 request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy
15 accounting adjustment of an electric utility pursuant to this
16 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
17 accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-hour
18 of electricity. If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account
