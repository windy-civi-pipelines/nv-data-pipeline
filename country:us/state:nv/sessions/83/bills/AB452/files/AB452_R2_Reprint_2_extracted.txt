EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada to open one or more investigatory
dockets to examine certain matters relating to a potential
cost-sharing adjustment mechanism; requiring a utility to
refund certain overcharges; revising provisions governing
certain applications filed by a public utility; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.3 of this bill requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to
2 open one or more investigatory dockets to examine certain matters relating to a
3 potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of costs for
4 purchased fuel and purchased power and the sharing of such costs between an
5 electric utility and its customers. Section 1.3 requires the Commission to submit
6 periodic reports to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and
7 Infrastructure concerning the progress of each investigatory docket and, on or
8 before July 1, 2026, submit a final report to the Legislative Commission on the
9 outcomes of the investigatory dockets. Under section 1.3, the Commission is
10 authorized to adopt regulations to establish a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism, if
11 the Commission finds it is in the public interest as a result of the investigatory
12 docket.
13 If the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than
14 any applicable rate or tariff allows, section 1.7 of this bill requires a utility to
15 refund to the customer, with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.
16 Existing law requires the Commission to issue a written order approving or
17 disapproving an application filed by a public utility to make any change in a
18 schedule not later than 210 days after the date on which the application is filed.
19 (NRS 704.110) Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission, for an application
20 filed by certain electric utilities, to issue such a written order not later than 300 days
21 after the date on which the application is filed.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this act.
3 Sec. 1.3. 1. The Commission shall open one or more
4 investigatory dockets to:
5 (a) Examine how costs for purchased fuel and purchased
6 power are currently passed through to customers.
7 (b) Examine the use of carrying charges on deferred energy
8 accounting and balances.
9 (c) Identify opportunities to mitigate the impact on customer
10 rates which are associated with fluctuations in the market for
11 purchased fuel and purchased power or other unpredictable events
12 which affect customer rates.
13 (d) Consider elements of a potential cost-sharing adjustment
14 mechanism for purchased fuel and purchased power which is
15 designed to align the financial incentives of an electric utility with
16 the interest of the customers of the electric utility, including,
17 without limitation:
18 (1) A cost-sharing percentage that is high enough to
19 incentivize the electric utility to keep the costs of purchased fuel
20 and purchased power low, but not low enough that the electric
21 utility is exposed to unreasonable levels of risk and volatility.
22 (2) Whether a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism is
23 symmetrical or asymmetrical.
24 (3) Whether to use a straight-sharing method or a sharing-
25 band method.
26 (4) Whether to use a forecasted estimate of costs or historic
27 information concerning costs.
28 (5) Options to improve the transparency of any forecasted
29 estimate of costs, including the use of a forward price index and
30 providing access to forecasted estimates to interveners in
31 proceedings of the Commission who sign nondisclosure
32 agreements.
33 (6) Implications of the inclusion of costs for purchased fuel
34 and purchased power on the participation of an electric utility in
35 real time and day-ahead markets.
36 (e) Examine existing practices and evaluate options that
37 reduce load and mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas,
38 including, without limitation, demand-side management programs
39 which are cost effective, demand response and load shifting.
40 2. Before the submission of the report required by subsection
41 3, the Commission shall submit periodic reports on the progress of
42 each investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1 to the
-
*AB452_R2*
– 3 –
1 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the
2 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and Infrastructure.
3 3. On or before July 1, 2026, the Commission shall submit a
4 report on the outcomes of each investigatory docket opened
5 pursuant to subsection 1, including, without limitation, the status
6 of any regulations adopted or considered as a result of the
7 investigatory docket, to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
8 Bureau for transmittal to the Legislative Commission.
9 4. If the Commission finds it is in the public interest, as a
10 result of the investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1,
11 the Commission may adopt regulations to establish a cost-sharing
12 adjustment mechanism.
13 5. As used in this section:
14 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a
15 mechanism that shares the risk of purchased fuel and purchased
16 power costs between an electric utility and its customers.
17 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
18 NRS 704.187.
19 Sec. 1.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the
20 Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer
21 more than any applicable rate or tariff allows, the utility shall
22 refund to the customer, with interest, the full amount of any
23 overcharge.
24 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
26 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may
27 otherwise be provided by the Commission pursuant to NRS
28 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
29 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
30 make changes in any schedule, including, without limitation,
31 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
32 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
33 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
34 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
35 application and the application is a general rate application or an
36 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
37 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
39 subsection 3, if a public utility files with the Commission an
40 application to make changes in any schedule, the Commission shall,
41 not later than 210 days after the date on which the application is
42 filed, issue a written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in
43 part, the proposed changes. If the public utility is an electric utility,
44 the Commission shall, not later than 300 days after the date on
-
*AB452_R2*
– 4 –
1 which the application is filed, issue a written order approving or
2 disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed changes.
3 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
4 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
5 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
6 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
7 which data were available when the application was prepared.
8 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining
9 whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates, the
10 Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
11 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
12 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
13 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
14 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
15 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
16 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
17 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
18 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
19 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
20 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
21 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
22 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
23 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
24 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
25 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
26 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
27 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
28 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
29 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
30 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
31 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
32 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
33 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
34 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
35 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
36 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
37 June 2019; and
38 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
39 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
40 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
41 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
42 counties shall file a general rate application:
43 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
44 June 2020; and
-
*AB452_R2*
– 5 –
1 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
2 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
3 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
4 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
5 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
6 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
7 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
8 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
9 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
10 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
11 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
12 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
13 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
14 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
15 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
16 paragraph for either service.
17 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
18 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
19 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
20 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
21 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
22 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
23 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
24 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
25 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
26 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
27 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
28 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
29 paragraph for either service.
30  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
31 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
32 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
33 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
34 rates.
35 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
36 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
37 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
38 of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a statement is
39 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
40 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
41 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
42 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
43 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
44 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
45 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
-
*AB452_R2*
– 6 –
1 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
2 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
3 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
4 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
5 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
6 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
7 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
8 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
9 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
10 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
11 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
12 utility has met its burden of proof:
13 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
14 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
15 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
16 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
17 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
18 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
19 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
20 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
21 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
22 subsection 3.
23 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
24 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
25 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
26 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
27 approved by the Commission.
28 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
29 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
30 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
31 Commission another general rate application until all pending
32 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
33 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
34 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
35 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
36 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
37 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
38 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
39 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
40 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
41 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
42 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
43 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
44 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
45 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
-
*AB452_R2*
– 7 –
1 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
2 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
3 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
4 subsection do not apply to:
5 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
6 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
7 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
8 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
9 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
10 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
11 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
12 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
13 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
14 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
15 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
16 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
17 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
18 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
19 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
20 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
21 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
22 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
23 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
25 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
26 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
27 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
28 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
29 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
30 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
31 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
32 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
33 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
34 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
35 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
36 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
37 NRS 704.069.
38 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
39 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
40 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
41 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
42 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
43 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
44 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
45 required by this paragraph:
-
*AB452_R2*
– 8 –
1 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
2 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
3 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
4 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
5 704.188; and
6 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
7 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
8 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
9 and as a percentage;
10 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
11 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
12 dollars and as a percentage;
13 (III) A statement that customers may send written
14 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
15 Commission;
16 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
17 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
18 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
19 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
20 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
21 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
22 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
23 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
24 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
25 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
26 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
27 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
28 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
29 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
30 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
31 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
32 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
33 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
34 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
35 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
36 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
37 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
38 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
39 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
40 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
41 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
42 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
43 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
44 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
45 based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased
-
*AB452_R2*
– 9 –
1 fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
2 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the
3 Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
4 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such
5 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with
6 the Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the
7 Commission finds that approval of the request is in the public
8 interest. If the Commission approves a request to make quarterly
9 adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an
10 electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment
11 to the deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25
12 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric
13 utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from the
14 electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or
15 purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate
16 adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
17 to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
18 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
19 is subject to the following requirements:
20 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
21 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
22 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
23 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
24 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
25 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
26 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
27 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
28 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
29 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
30 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
31 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
32 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
33 NRS 704.069.
34 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
35 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
36 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
37 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
38 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
39 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
40 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
41 required by this paragraph:
42 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
43 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
44 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
-
*AB452_R2*
– 10 –
1 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
2 704.188; and
3 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
4 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
5 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
6 and as a percentage;
7 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
8 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
9 dollars and as a percentage;
10 (III) A statement that customers may send written
11 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
12 Commission;
13 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
14 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
15 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
16 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
17 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
18 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
19 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
20 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
21 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with
22 the Commission. The annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
23 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
24 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
25 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
26 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
27 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
28 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
29 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
30 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
31 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
32 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
33 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
34 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
35 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
36 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
37 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
38 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
39 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
40 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
41 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
42 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
43 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
44 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
45 application were not reasonable or prudent.

1 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
2 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
3 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
4 electric utility shall:
5 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
6 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
7 and rate design; and
8 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
9 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
10 rate application.
11 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
12 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
13 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
14 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
15 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
16 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
17 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
18 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
19 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may
20 recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing, or
21 retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the
22 purposes of this subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall
23 be deemed to be accepted by the Commission only as to that portion
24 of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or modified with the
25 consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
26 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved
27 pursuant to this section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
28 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay
29 the implementation of that new rate:
30 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
31 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission,
32 including, without limitation, a requirement that interest charges be
33 included in the collection of the new rate; and
34 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-
35 income residential customers.
36 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause
37 shown, permit a public utility which purchases natural gas for resale
38 or an electric utility to make a quarterly adjustment to its deferred
39 energy accounting adjustment in excess of the maximum allowable
40 adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
41 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an
42 electric utility that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred

11 hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which the
12 rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours
13 sold pursuant to an expanded solar access program established
14 pursuant to NRS 704.7865.

22 in counties whose population is less than 700,000.
23 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated
24 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
25 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating

SECOND REPRINT A.B. 452
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 452–ASSEMBLYMEMBER BROWN-MAY
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public utilities.
(BDR 58-572)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada to open one or more investigatory
dockets to examine certain matters relating to a potential
cost-sharing adjustment mechanism; requiring a utility to
refund certain overcharges; revising provisions governing
certain applications filed by a public utility; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.3 of this bill requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to
2 open one or more investigatory dockets to examine certain matters relating to a
3 potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of costs for
4 purchased fuel and purchased power and the sharing of such costs between an
5 electric utility and its customers. Section 1.3 requires the Commission to submit
6 periodic reports to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and
7 Infrastructure concerning the progress of each investigatory docket and, on or
8 before July 1, 2026, submit a final report to the Legislative Commission on the
9 outcomes of the investigatory dockets. Under section 1.3, the Commission is
10 authorized to adopt regulations to establish a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism, if
11 the Commission finds it is in the public interest as a result of the investigatory
12 docket.
13 If the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than
14 any applicable rate or tariff allows, section 1.7 of this bill requires a utility to
15 refund to the customer, with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.
16 Existing law requires the Commission to issue a written order approving or
17 disapproving an application filed by a public utility to make any change in a
18 schedule not later than 210 days after the date on which the application is filed.
19 (NRS 704.110) Section 2 of this bill requires the Commission, for an application
20 filed by certain electric utilities, to issue such a written order not later than 300 days
21 after the date on which the application is filed.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this act.
3 Sec. 1.3. 1. The Commission shall open one or more
4 investigatory dockets to:
5 (a) Examine how costs for purchased fuel and purchased
6 power are currently passed through to customers.
7 (b) Examine the use of carrying charges on deferred energy
8 accounting and balances.
9 (c) Identify opportunities to mitigate the impact on customer
10 rates which are associated with fluctuations in the market for
11 purchased fuel and purchased power or other unpredictable events
12 which affect customer rates.
13 (d) Consider elements of a potential cost-sharing adjustment
14 mechanism for purchased fuel and purchased power which is
15 designed to align the financial incentives of an electric utility with
16 the interest of the customers of the electric utility, including,
17 without limitation:
18 (1) A cost-sharing percentage that is high enough to
19 incentivize the electric utility to keep the costs of purchased fuel
20 and purchased power low, but not low enough that the electric
21 utility is exposed to unreasonable levels of risk and volatility.
22 (2) Whether a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism is
23 symmetrical or asymmetrical.
24 (3) Whether to use a straight-sharing method or a sharing-
25 band method.
26 (4) Whether to use a forecasted estimate of costs or historic
27 information concerning costs.
28 (5) Options to improve the transparency of any forecasted
29 estimate of costs, including the use of a forward price index and
30 providing access to forecasted estimates to interveners in
31 proceedings of the Commission who sign nondisclosure
32 agreements.
33 (6) Implications of the inclusion of costs for purchased fuel
34 and purchased power on the participation of an electric utility in
35 real time and day-ahead markets.
36 (e) Examine existing practices and evaluate options that
37 reduce load and mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas,
38 including, without limitation, demand-side management programs
39 which are cost effective, demand response and load shifting.
40 2. Before the submission of the report required by subsection
41 3, the Commission shall submit periodic reports on the progress of
42 each investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1 to the
-
*AB452_R2*

– 3 –
1 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the
2 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and Infrastructure.
3 3. On or before July 1, 2026, the Commission shall submit a
4 report on the outcomes of each investigatory docket opened
5 pursuant to subsection 1, including, without limitation, the status
6 of any regulations adopted or considered as a result of the
7 investigatory docket, to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
8 Bureau for transmittal to the Legislative Commission.
9 4. If the Commission finds it is in the public interest, as a
10 result of the investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1,
11 the Commission may adopt regulations to establish a cost-sharing
12 adjustment mechanism.
13 5. As used in this section:
14 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a
15 mechanism that shares the risk of purchased fuel and purchased
16 power costs between an electric utility and its customers.
17 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
18 NRS 704.187.
19 Sec. 1.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the
20 Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer
21 more than any applicable rate or tariff allows, the utility shall
22 refund to the customer, with interest, the full amount of any
23 overcharge.
24 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
26 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may
27 otherwise be provided by the Commission pursuant to NRS
28 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
29 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
30 make changes in any schedule, including, without limitation,
31 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
32 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
33 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
34 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
35 application and the application is a general rate application or an
36 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
37 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
39 subsection 3, if a public utility files with the Commission an
40 application to make changes in any schedule, the Commission shall,
41 not later than 210 days after the date on which the application is
42 filed, issue a written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in
43 part, the proposed changes. If the public utility is an electric utility,
44 the Commission shall, not later than 300 days after the date on
-
*AB452_R2*

– 4 –
1 which the application is filed, issue a written order approving or
2 disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed changes.
3 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
4 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
5 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
6 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
7 which data were available when the application was prepared.
8 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining
9 whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates, the
10 Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
11 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
12 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
13 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
14 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
15 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
16 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
17 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
18 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
19 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
20 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
21 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
22 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
23 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
24 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
25 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
26 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
27 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
28 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
29 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
30 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
31 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
32 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
33 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
34 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
35 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
36 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
37 June 2019; and
38 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
39 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
40 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
41 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
42 counties shall file a general rate application:
43 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
44 June 2020; and
-
*AB452_R2*

– 5 –
1 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
2 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
3 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
4 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
5 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
6 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
7 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
8 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
9 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
10 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
11 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
12 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
13 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
14 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
15 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
16 paragraph for either service.
17 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
18 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
19 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
20 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
21 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
22 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
23 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
24 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
25 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
26 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
27 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
28 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
29 paragraph for either service.
30  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
31 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
32 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
33 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
34 rates.
35 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
36 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
37 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
38 of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a statement is
39 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
40 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
41 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
42 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
43 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
44 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
45 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
-
*AB452_R2*

– 6 –
1 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
2 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
3 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
4 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
5 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
6 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
7 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
8 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
9 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
10 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
11 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
12 utility has met its burden of proof:
13 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
14 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
15 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
16 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
17 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
18 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
19 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
20 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
21 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
22 subsection 3.
23 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
24 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
25 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
26 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
27 approved by the Commission.
28 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
29 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
30 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
31 Commission another general rate application until all pending
32 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
33 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
34 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
35 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
36 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
37 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
38 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
39 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
40 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
41 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
42 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
43 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
44 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
45 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
-
*AB452_R2*

– 7 –
1 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
2 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
3 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
4 subsection do not apply to:
5 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
6 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
7 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
8 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
9 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
10 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
11 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
12 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
13 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
14 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
15 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
16 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
17 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
18 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
19 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
20 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
21 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
22 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
23 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
25 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
26 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
27 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
28 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
29 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
30 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
31 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
32 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
33 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
34 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
35 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
36 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
37 NRS 704.069.
38 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
39 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
40 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
41 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
42 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
43 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
44 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
45 required by this paragraph:
-
*AB452_R2*

– 8 –
1 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
2 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
3 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
4 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
5 704.188; and
6 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
7 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
8 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
9 and as a percentage;
10 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
11 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
12 dollars and as a percentage;
13 (III) A statement that customers may send written
14 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
15 Commission;
16 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
17 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
18 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
19 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
20 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
21 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
22 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
23 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
24 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
25 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
26 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
27 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
28 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
29 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
30 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
31 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
32 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
33 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
34 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
35 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
36 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
37 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
38 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
39 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
40 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
41 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
42 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
43 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
44 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
45 based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased

1 fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
2 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the
3 Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
4 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such
5 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with
6 the Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the
7 Commission finds that approval of the request is in the public
8 interest. If the Commission approves a request to make quarterly
9 adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an
10 electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment
11 to the deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25
12 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric
13 utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from the
14 electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or
15 purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate
16 adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
17 to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
18 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
19 is subject to the following requirements:
20 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
21 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
22 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
23 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
24 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
25 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
26 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
27 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
28 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
29 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
30 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
31 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
32 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
33 NRS 704.069.
34 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
35 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
36 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
37 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
38 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
39 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
40 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
41 required by this paragraph:
42 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
43 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
44 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment

1 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
2 704.188; and
3 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
4 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
5 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
6 and as a percentage;
7 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
8 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
9 dollars and as a percentage;
10 (III) A statement that customers may send written
11 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
12 Commission;
13 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
14 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
15 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
16 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
17 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
18 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
19 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
20 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
21 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with
22 the Commission. The annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
23 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
24 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
25 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
26 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
27 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
28 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
29 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
30 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
31 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
32 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
33 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
34 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
35 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
36 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
37 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
38 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
39 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
40 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
41 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
42 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
43 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
44 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
45 application were not reasonable or prudent.

1 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
2 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
3 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
4 electric utility shall:
5 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
6 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
7 and rate design; and
8 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
9 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
10 rate application.
11 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
12 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
13 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
14 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
15 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
16 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
17 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
18 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
19 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may
20 recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing, or
21 retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the
22 purposes of this subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall
23 be deemed to be accepted by the Commission only as to that portion
24 of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or modified with the
25 consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
26 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved
27 pursuant to this section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
28 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay
29 the implementation of that new rate:
30 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
31 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission,
32 including, without limitation, a requirement that interest charges be
33 included in the collection of the new rate; and
34 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-
35 income residential customers.
36 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause
37 shown, permit a public utility which purchases natural gas for resale
38 or an electric utility to make a quarterly adjustment to its deferred
39 energy accounting adjustment in excess of the maximum allowable
40 adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
41 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an
42 electric utility that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred
43 energy accounting adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may
44 submit to the Commission for approval an application to discontinue
45 making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting

1 adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its
2 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may
3 approve an application submitted pursuant to this subsection if the
4 Commission finds that approval of the application is in the public
5 interest.
6 17. As used in this section:
7 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a
8 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric
9 utility that is calculated by dividing the balance of a deferred
10 account during a specified period by the total therms or kilowatt-
11 hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which the
12 rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours
13 sold pursuant to an expanded solar access program established
14 pursuant to NRS 704.7865.
15 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
16 NRS 704.187.
17 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
18 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
19 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
20 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
21 population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located
22 in counties whose population is less than 700,000.
23 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated
24 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
25 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
26 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
27 population is less than 700,000 than it does from customers located
28 in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
