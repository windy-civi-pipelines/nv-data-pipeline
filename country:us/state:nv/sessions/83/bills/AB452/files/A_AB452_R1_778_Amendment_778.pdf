SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public utilities. (BDR 58-572)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring the Public Utilities Commission of
Nevada to open one or more investigatory dockets to examine certain
matters relating to a potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism;
requiring a utility to refund certain overcharges; revising provisions
governing certain applications filed by a public utility; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.3 of this bill requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to open one or
2 more investigatory dockets to examine certain matters relating to a potential cost-sharing
3 adjustment mechanism for the recovery of costs for purchased fuel and purchased power and
4 the sharing of such costs between an electric utility and its customers. Section 1.3 requires the
5 Commission to submit periodic reports to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth
6 and Infrastructure concerning the progress of each investigatory docket and, on or before July
7 1, 2026, submit a final report to the Legislative Commission on the outcomes of the
8 investigatory dockets. Under section 1.3, the Commission is authorized to adopt regulations to
9 establish a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism, if the Commission finds it is in the public
10 interest as a result of the investigatory docket.
11 If the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any
12 applicable rate or tariff allows, section 1.7 of this bill requires a utility to refund to the
13 customer, with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.
14 Existing law requires the Commission to issue a written order approving or disapproving
15 an application filed by a public utility to make any change in a schedule not later than 210
16 days after the date on which the application is filed. (NRS 704.110) Section 2 of this bill
17 [authorizes] requires the Commission, [under certain circumstances, to extend by not more
18 than 90 days the time to act on such] for an application filed by certain electric utilities [.] , to
19 issue such a written order not later than 300 days after the date on which the application
20 is filed.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this act.
3 Sec. 1.3. 1. The Commission shall open one or more investigatory dockets
4 to:
5 (a) Examine how costs for purchased fuel and purchased power are
6 currently passed through to customers.
7 (b) Examine the use of carrying charges on deferred energy accounting and
8 balances.
9 (c) Identify opportunities to mitigate the impact on customer rates which are
10 associated with fluctuations in the market for purchased fuel and purchased
11 power or other unpredictable events which affect customer rates.
12 (d) Consider elements of a potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for
13 purchased fuel and purchased power which is designed to align the financial
14 incentives of an electric utility with the interest of the customers of the electric
15 utility, including, without limitation:
16 (1) A cost-sharing percentage that is high enough to incentivize the
17 electric utility to keep the costs of purchased fuel and purchased power low, but
18 not low enough that the electric utility is exposed to unreasonable levels of risk
19 and volatility.
20 (2) Whether a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism is symmetrical or
21 asymmetrical.
22 (3) Whether to use a straight-sharing method or a sharing-band method.
23 (4) Whether to use a forecasted estimate of costs or historic information
24 concerning costs.
25 (5) Options to improve the transparency of any forecasted estimate of
26 costs, including the use of a forward price index and providing access to
27 forecasted estimates to interveners in proceedings of the Commission who sign
28 nondisclosure agreements.
29 (6) Implications of the inclusion of costs for purchased fuel and
30 purchased power on the participation of an electric utility in real time and day-
31 ahead markets.
32 (e) Examine existing practices [for integrated resource planning] and
33 evaluate options that reduce load and mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas,
34 including, without limitation, demand-side management programs which are cost
35 effective, demand response and load shifting.
36 2. Before the submission of the report required by subsection 3, the
37 Commission shall submit periodic reports on the progress of each investigatory
38 docket opened pursuant to subsection 1 to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
39 Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and
40 Infrastructure.
41 3. On or before July 1, 2026, the Commission shall submit a report on the
42 outcomes of each investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1,
43 including, without limitation, the status of any regulations adopted or considered
44 as a result of the investigatory docket, to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
45 Bureau for transmittal to the Legislative Commission.
46 4. If the Commission finds it is in the public interest, as a result of the
47 investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1, the Commission may adopt
48 regulations to establish a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism.
49 5. As used in this section:

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 5
1 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a mechanism that shares
2 the risk of purchased fuel and purchased power costs between an electric utility
3 and its customers.
4 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
5 Sec. 1.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Commission
6 determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any applicable rate or
7 tariff allows, the utility shall refund to the customer, with interest, the full
8 amount of any overcharge.
9 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to
11 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may otherwise be provided by the
12 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
13 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
14 in any schedule, including, without limitation, changes that will result in a
15 discontinuance, modification or restriction of service, the Commission shall
16 investigate the propriety of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve
17 or disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an application
18 and the application is a general rate application or an annual deferred energy
19 accounting adjustment application, the Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a
20 party of record.
21 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection 3, if a
22 public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in any
23 schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the date on which the
24 application is filed, issue a written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in
25 part, the proposed changes. If the public utility is an electric utility, the
26 Commission [may, upon good cause, extend by] shall, not [more] later than [90]
27 300 days after the [time to act upon] date on which the application [.] is filed,
28 issue a written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed
29 changes.
30 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
31 public utility shall submit with its application a statement showing the recorded
32 results of revenues, expenses, investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12
33 months for which data were available when the application was prepared. Except as
34 otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining whether to approve or
35 disapprove any increased rates, the Commission shall consider evidence in support
36 of the increased rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
37 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased investment in facilities,
38 increased expenses for depreciation, certain other operating expenses as approved
39 by the Commission and changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
40 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become
41 effective within 6 months after the last month of those 12 months, but the public
42 utility shall not place into effect any increased rates until the changes have been
43 experienced and certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
44 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission shall also consider
45 evidence supporting expenses for depreciation, calculated on an annual basis,
46 applicable to major components of the public utility’s plant placed into service
47 during the recorded test period or the period for certification as set forth in the
48 application. Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
49 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date on which the
50 certification required by this subsection is filed with the Commission, or within the
51 period set forth in subsection 2, whichever time is longer, the Commission shall
52 make such order in reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter.

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 6
1 The following public utilities shall each file a general rate application pursuant to
2 this subsection based on the following schedule:
3 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties
4 shall file a general rate application:
5 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2019; and
6 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
7 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
8 704.7621.
9 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties shall file
10 a general rate application:
11 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2020; and
12 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
13 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
14 704.7621.
15 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
16 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
17 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
18 preceding 3 years and which had not filed a general rate application with the
19 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
20 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
21 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
22 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
23 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
24 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
25 either service.
26 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
27 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
28 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
29 preceding 3 years and which had filed a general rate application with the
30 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
31 before June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
32 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
33 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
34 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
35 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
36 either service.
37  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for waivers
38 pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the costs incurred by the public
39 utility in preparing and presenting the general rate application before the effective
40 date of any change in rates.
41 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to subsection 3, a
42 public utility may submit with its general rate application a statement showing the
43 effects, on an annualized basis, of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a
44 statement is filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
45 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which its general rate
46 application is filed with the Commission if such expected changes in circumstances
47 are reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public
48 utility submits such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
49 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are reasonably known
50 and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. The Commission shall consider
51 expected changes in circumstances to be reasonably known and measurable with
52 reasonable accuracy if the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific
53 and identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns or

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 7
1 developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring to the degree, in
2 the amount and at the time expected, are primarily measurable by recorded or
3 verifiable revenues and expenses and are easily and objectively calculated, with the
4 calculation of the expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates,
5 forecasts, projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
6 utility has met its burden of proof:
7 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted pursuant to this
8 subsection and evidence relevant to the statement, including all reasonable
9 projected or forecasted offsets in revenue and expenses that are directly attributable
10 to or associated with the expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in
11 addition to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
12 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
13 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission the
14 certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 3.
15 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
16 in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a final written order regarding
17 the proposed changes within the time required by this section, the proposed changes
18 shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.
19 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
20 public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the public utility through common
21 ownership, shall not file with the Commission another general rate application until
22 all pending general rate applications filed by that public utility have been decided
23 by the Commission unless, after application and hearing, the Commission
24 determines that a substantial financial emergency would exist if the public utility or
25 its affiliate is not permitted to file another general rate application sooner. The
26 provisions of this subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
27 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an application to recover
28 the increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for
29 resale pursuant to subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8
30 or 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements pursuant to
31 NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
32 pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility is otherwise authorized to so file by
33 those provisions.
34 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the increased cost of
35 purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale once every 30
36 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to:
37 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
38 pursuant to subsection 10; or
39 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and which adjusts its
40 rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
41 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must request
42 approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between
43 annual rate adjustment applications based on changes in the public utility’s
44 recorded costs of natural gas purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases
45 natural gas for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may request
46 approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
47 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such a request not
48 later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
49 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
50 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
51 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of a public
52 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
53 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of natural gas. If the

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 8
1 balance of the public utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from
2 the public utility’s annual recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate
3 quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
4 to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
5 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate adjustments on a
6 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
7 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the Commission before the
8 public utility makes a quarterly rate adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not
9 subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the
10 requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
11 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
12 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
13 regular monthly bill or by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
14 public utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
15 than 30 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice with
16 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
17 paragraph:
18 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
19 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
20 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
21 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
22 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
23 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the public utility’s
24 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
25 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
26 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
27 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
28 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
29 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas
30 which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for
31 reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to
32 review the annual rate adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
33 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
34 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment application with the
35 Commission. The annual rate adjustment application is subject to the requirements
36 for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a
37 consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
38 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment application must
39 include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded
40 costs of natural gas included in each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment
41 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
42 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of natural gas
43 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application,
44 and the public utility has the burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the
45 proceeding.
46 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover any recorded
47 costs of natural gas which were the result of any practice or transaction that was
48 unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the public
49 utility, and the Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
50 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas included in any
51 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application were not
52 reasonable or prudent.

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 9
1 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis based on
2 changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased fuel or purchased
3 power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a quarterly basis, an electric utility may
4 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its
5 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny
6 such a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with the
7 Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds
8 that approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a
9 request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment
10 of an electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the
11 deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-
12 hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account varies by
13 less than 5 percent from the electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased
14 fuel or purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the
15 deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour
16 of electricity.
17 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10 is subject to
18 the following requirements:
19 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the Commission on or
20 before August 15, 2007, and every quarter thereafter of the quarterly rate
21 adjustment to be made by the electric utility for the following quarter. The first
22 quarterly rate adjustment by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007,
23 and each subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
24 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy accounting
25 adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by the Commission approving
26 the application of an electric utility to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred
27 energy accounting adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
28 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the requirements
29 for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
30 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
31 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
32 regular monthly bill or by electronic submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
33 electric utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
34 than 30 days after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
35 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
36 paragraph:
37 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
38 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
39 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
40 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
41 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
42 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the electric utility’s
43 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
44 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
45 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
46 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
47 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
48 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of purchased
49 fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will
50 be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the
51 Commission to review the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
52 application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
53 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 10
1 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy accounting
2 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with the Commission. The annual
3 deferred energy accounting adjustment application is subject to the requirements for
4 notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
5 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
6 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy accounting
7 adjustment application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and
8 the transactions and recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included
9 in each quarterly filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
10 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
11 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of purchased fuel
12 and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
13 deferred energy accounting adjustment application, and the electric utility has the
14 burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
15 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover any recorded
16 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which were the result of any practice
17 or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed
18 imprudently by the electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric
19 utility to adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs of
20 purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or
21 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application were not reasonable
22 or prudent.
23 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
24 application pursuant to subsection 11 and NRS 704.187 while a general rate
25 application is pending, the electric utility shall:
26 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
27 information relating to the cost of service and rate design; and
28 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same information, if such
29 information was not submitted with the general rate application.
30 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted pursuant to NRS
31 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for acquisition or construction pursuant
32 to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
33 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction and capacity
34 replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316 and accepted by the
35 Commission for retirement or elimination pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
36 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment.
37 The utility may recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing,
38 or retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the purposes of this
39 subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall be deemed to be accepted by the
40 Commission only as to that portion of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or
41 modified with the consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
42 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved pursuant to this
43 section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
44 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay the
45 implementation of that new rate:
46 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
47 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission, including, without
48 limitation, a requirement that interest charges be included in the collection of the
49 new rate; and
50 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-income residential
51 customers.
52 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause shown, permit a
53 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility to make a

Senate Amendment No. 778 to Assembly Bill No. 452 First Reprint Page 11
1 quarterly adjustment to its deferred energy accounting adjustment in excess of the
2 maximum allowable adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
3 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility
4 that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment
5 pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may submit to the Commission for approval an
6 application to discontinue making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
7 accounting adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its deferred
8 energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may approve an application
