AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring [certain electric utilities to include a
cost-sharing adjustment mechanism in certain plans the utility is
required to submit to] the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada [;
establishing certain requirements for] to open one or more
investigatory dockets to examine certain matters relating to a
potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism; requiring a utility to
refund certain overcharges; revising provisions governing certain
[quarterly and annual adjustments to a required general rate
application; revising provisions governing the review of certain plans
by the Commission;] applications filed by a public utility; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires each electric utility to submit to] Section 1.3 of this bill requires
2 the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada [every 3 years an integrated resource plan] to
3 [increase the utility’s supply of electricity or decrease the demands made on its system by its
4 customers. (NRS 704.741) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require certain electric utilities to
5 include in such a plan] open one or more investigatory dockets to examine certain matters
6 relating to a potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of costs for
7 purchased fuel and purchased power and the sharing of such costs between an electric utility
8 and its customers. Section [1 also establishes certain requirements for such a cost-sharing
9 adjustment mechanism. Section 1 requires a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism to be based
10 on a forecasted estimate of costs for purchased fuel and purchased power which is made by
11 the utility, and requires the utility to provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to:
12 (1) the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission ; (2) the Bureau of Consumer
13 Protection in the Office of the Attorney General; and (3) any intervenor who signs a
14 nondisclosure agreement, including the Office of Economic Development. Section 1 provides
15 for the calculation of costs or savings based on the forecasted estimate and authorizes the
16 percentage of costs or savings which are shared between the utility and its customers to be
17 symmetrical or asymmetrical as the Commission deems necessary to incentivize the utility to
18 manage costs effectively. Section 1 requires the utility to : (1) include in its plan the financial
19 strategy employed by the utility to reduce risks which are associated with fluctuations in the
20 market; and (2) propose an annual cap on the cumulative amount of] 1.3 requires the
21 Commission to submit periodic reports to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
22 Growth and Infrastructure concerning the progress of each investigatory docket and, on
Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 4
23 or before July 1, 2026, submit a final report to the Legislative Commission on the
24 outcomes of the investigatory dockets. Under section 1.3, the Commission is authorized
25 to adopt regulations to establish a cost-sharing [adjustments.] adjustment mechanism, if
26 the Commission finds it is in the public interest as a result of the investigatory docket.
27 If the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any
28 applicable rate or tariff allows, section 1.7 of this bill requires a utility to refund to the
29 customer, with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.
30 Existing law requires [certain electric utilities] the Commission to [file a general rate
31 application once every 36 months and to file certain quarterly and annual adjustments.] issue
32 a written order approving or disapproving an application filed by a public utility to
33 make any change in a schedule not later than 210 days after the date on which the
34 application is filed. (NRS [704.110, 704.187)] 704.110) Section 2 of this bill [requires the
35 quarterly and annual adjustments to take into account any cost-sharing adjustments made
36 pursuant to section 1. Existing law requires] authorizes the Commission , under certain
37 circumstances, to [issue certain orders to accept or modify, or deem inadequate any portion
38 of, the plan filed pursuant to section 4 which relates to the energy supply plan of the utility
39 within 135 days after a utility has filed the plan. (NRS 704.751) Section 5 of this bill requires
40 the Commission to issue such orders within 180 days after a utility has filed: (1) the plan; and
41 (2) any update of a portion of the plan that the Commission requires. Sections 1 and 3 of this
42 bill make section 1 applicable to] extend by not more than 90 days the time to act on such
43 an application filed by certain electric utilities.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto [a new
2 section to read] the provisions set forth as [follows:] sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this
3 act.
4 Sec. 1.3. 1. [An electric utility shall include as part of the portions of the
5 plan required by NRS 704.741 relating to the energy supply plan for the utility for
6 the 3 years covered by the plan and as part of any update to those portions that
7 the] The Commission [may require:] shall open one or more investigatory dockets
8 to:
9 (a) [A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of] Examine how
10 costs for purchased fuel and purchased power [that meets the requirements of
11 this section; and] are currently passed through to customers.

20 [must be based on a forecasted estimate of costs] for purchased fuel and
21 purchased power which is [made by the] designed to align the financial incentives
22 of an electric utility [. An] with the interest of the customers of the electric utility
23 [shall provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to:
24 (a) The Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission;

1 3. A] , including, without limitation:
2 (1) A cost-sharing [adjustment mechanism must incorporate the
3 deadband which is calculated pursuant to subsection 10 of NRS 704.110. Any]
4 percentage that is high enough to incentivize the electric utility to keep the costs
5 of purchased fuel and purchased power [, or savings on such costs, that are above
6 or below the deadband must be shared between] low, but not low enough that the
7 electric utility [and the customers of the utility as described in subsections 4 and
8 5.
9 4. The percentage of costs of purchased fuel and purchased power, or
10 savings on such costs, that are shared between an electric utility and its
11 customers pursuant to subsection 3 may be] is exposed to unreasonable levels of
12 risk and volatility.
13 (2) Whether a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism is symmetrical or
14 asymmetrical . [as the Commission deems necessary to incentivize the utility to
15 manage costs effectively.
16 5. An electric utility shall propose an annual cap on the cumulative amount
17 of cost-sharing adjustments pursuant to subsections 3 and 4, whether costs or
18 savings, which must be based on a percentage of the authorized return on the
19 equity of the electric utility and expressed in basis points representing one-
20 hundredth of a percent. If the earnings of the electric utility are:
21 (a) Below the cap, the utility may recover excess costs pursuant to
22 subsections 3 and 4 until the cap is reached; or
23 (b) Above the cap, the utility shall refund to the customers of the utility the
24 savings pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 until the cap is reached.
25 6.] (3) Whether to use a straight-sharing method or a sharing-band method.
26 (4) Whether to use a forecasted estimate of costs or historic information
27 concerning costs.
28 (5) Options to improve the transparency of any forecasted estimate of
29 costs, including the use of a forward price index and providing access to
30 forecasted estimates to interveners in proceedings of the Commission who sign
31 nondisclosure agreements.
32 (6) Implications of the inclusion of costs for purchased fuel and
33 purchased power on the participation of an electric utility in real time and day-
34 ahead markets.
35 (e) Examine existing practices for integrated resource planning and evaluate
36 options that reduce load and mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas,
37 including, without limitation, demand-side management programs which are cost
38 effective, demand response and load shifting.
39 2. Before the submission of the report required by subsection 3, the
40 Commission shall submit periodic reports on the progress of each investigatory
41 docket opened pursuant to subsection 1 to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
42 Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and
43 Infrastructure.
44 3. On or before July 1, 2026, the Commission shall submit a report on the
45 outcomes of each investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1,
46 including, without limitation, the status of any regulations adopted or considered
47 as a result of the investigatory docket, to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
48 Bureau for transmittal to the Legislative Commission.
49 4. If the Commission finds it is in the public interest, as a result of the
50 investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1, the Commission may adopt
51 regulations to establish a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism.
52 5. As used in this section:
Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 6
1 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a mechanism that shares
2 the risk of purchased fuel and purchased power costs between an electric utility
3 and its customers.
4 (b) [“Deadband” means a range around a performance target within which
5 the performance of an electric utility is deemed reasonable, for which
6 performance the electric utility does not receive a reward or penalty and which
7 recognizes the inherent uncertainty or margin of error in measuring and
8 calculating a given benchmark or baseline.
9 (c)] “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
10 Sec. 1.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Commission
11 determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any applicable rate or
12 tariff allows, the utility shall refund to the customer, with interest, the full
13 amount of any overcharge.
14 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to
16 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may otherwise be provided by the
17 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
18 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
19 in any schedule, including, without limitation, changes that will result in a
20 discontinuance, modification or restriction of service, the Commission shall
21 investigate the propriety of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve
22 or disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an application
23 and the application is a general rate application or an annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment application, the Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a
25 party of record.
26 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection 3, if a
27 public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in any
28 schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the date on which the
29 application is filed, issue a written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in
30 part, the proposed changes. If the public utility is an electric utility, the
31 Commission may, upon good cause, extend by not more than 90 days the time to
32 act upon the application.
33 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
34 public utility shall submit with its application a statement showing the recorded
35 results of revenues, expenses, investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12
36 months for which data were available when the application was prepared . [,
37 including, without limitation, the results of any cost-sharing adjustment
38 mechanism pursuant to section 1 of this act, if applicable.] Except as otherwise
39 provided in subsection 4, in determining whether to approve or disapprove any
40 increased rates, the Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
41 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same 12 months,
42 adjusted for increased revenues, any increased investment in facilities, increased
43 expenses for depreciation, certain other operating expenses as approved by the
44 Commission and changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
45 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become
46 effective within 6 months after the last month of those 12 months, but the public
47 utility shall not place into effect any increased rates until the changes have been
48 experienced and certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
49 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission shall also consider
50 evidence supporting expenses for depreciation, calculated on an annual basis,
51 applicable to major components of the public utility’s plant placed into service
52 during the recorded test period or the period for certification as set forth in the
53 application. Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 7
1 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date on which the
2 certification required by this subsection is filed with the Commission, or within the
3 period set forth in subsection 2, whichever time is longer, the Commission shall
4 make such order in reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter.
5 The following public utilities shall each file a general rate application pursuant to
6 this subsection based on the following schedule:
7 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties
8 shall file a general rate application:
9 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2019; and
10 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
11 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
12 704.7621.
13 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties shall file
14 a general rate application:
15 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2020; and
16 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
17 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
18 704.7621.
19 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
20 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
21 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
22 preceding 3 years and which had not filed a general rate application with the
23 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
24 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
25 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
26 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
27 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
28 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
29 either service.
30 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
31 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
32 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
33 preceding 3 years and which had filed a general rate application with the
34 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
35 before June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
36 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
37 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
38 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
39 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
40 either service.
41  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for waivers
42 pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the costs incurred by the public
43 utility in preparing and presenting the general rate application before the effective
44 date of any change in rates.
45 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to subsection 3, a
46 public utility may submit with its general rate application a statement showing the
47 effects, on an annualized basis, of all expected changes in circumstances . [,
48 including, without limitation, the results of any cost-sharing adjustment
49 mechanism pursuant to section 1 of this act, if applicable.] If such a statement is
50 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and expenses which
51 may occur within 210 days after the date on which its general rate application is
52 filed with the Commission if such expected changes in circumstances are
53 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility
Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 8
1 submits such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
2 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are reasonably known
3 and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. The Commission shall consider
4 expected changes in circumstances to be reasonably known and measurable with
5 reasonable accuracy if the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific
6 and identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns or
7 developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring to the degree, in
8 the amount and at the time expected, are primarily measurable by recorded or
9 verifiable revenues and expenses and are easily and objectively calculated, with the
10 calculation of the expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates,
11 forecasts, projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
12 utility has met its burden of proof:
13 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted pursuant to this
14 subsection and evidence relevant to the statement, including all reasonable
15 projected or forecasted offsets in revenue and expenses that are directly attributable
16 to or associated with the expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in
17 addition to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
18 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
19 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission the
20 certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 3.
21 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
22 in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a final written order regarding
23 the proposed changes within the time required by this section, the proposed changes
24 shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.
25 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
26 public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the public utility through common
27 ownership, shall not file with the Commission another general rate application until
28 all pending general rate applications filed by that public utility have been decided
29 by the Commission unless, after application and hearing, the Commission
30 determines that a substantial financial emergency would exist if the public utility or
31 its affiliate is not permitted to file another general rate application sooner. The
32 provisions of this subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
33 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an application to recover
34 the increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for
35 resale pursuant to subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8
36 or 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements pursuant to
37 NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
38 pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility is otherwise authorized to so file by
39 those provisions.
40 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the increased cost of
41 purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale once every 30
42 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to:
43 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
44 pursuant to subsection 10; or
45 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and which adjusts its
46 rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
47 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must request
48 approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between
49 annual rate adjustment applications based on changes in the public utility’s
50 recorded costs of natural gas purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases
51 natural gas for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may request
52 approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
53 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such a request not
Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 9
1 later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
2 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
3 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
4 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of a public
5 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
6 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of natural gas. If the
7 balance of the public utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from
8 the public utility’s annual recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate
9 quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
10 to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
11 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate adjustments on a
12 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
13 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the Commission before the
14 public utility makes a quarterly rate adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not
15 subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the
16 requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
17 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
18 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
19 regular monthly bill or by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
20 public utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
21 than 30 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice with
22 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
23 paragraph:
24 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
25 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
26 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
27 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
28 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
29 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the public utility’s
30 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
31 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
32 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
33 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
34 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
35 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas
36 which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for
37 reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to
38 review the annual rate adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
39 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
40 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment application with the
41 Commission. The annual rate adjustment application is subject to the requirements
42 for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a
43 consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
44 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment application must
45 include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded
46 costs of natural gas included in each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment
47 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
48 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of natural gas
49 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application,
50 and the public utility has the burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the
51 proceeding.
52 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover any recorded
53 costs of natural gas which were the result of any practice or transaction that was
Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 10
1 unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the public
2 utility, and the Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
3 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas included in any
4 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application were not
5 reasonable or prudent.
6 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates [, in compliance with section 1 of
7 this act,] on a quarterly basis based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded
8 costs of purchased fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
9 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the Commission to
10 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment . [in
11 compliance with section 1 of this act.] The Commission shall approve or deny such
12 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission.
13 The Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of
14 the request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
15 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an electric
16 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
17 accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
18 If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent
19 from the electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or purchased
20 power which are used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy
21 accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
22 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10 [must comply
23 with section 1 of this act and] is subject to the following requirements:
24 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the Commission on or
25 before August 15, 2007, and every quarter thereafter of the quarterly rate
26 adjustment to be made by the electric utility for the following quarter. The first
27 quarterly rate adjustment by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007,
28 and each subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
29 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy accounting
30 adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by the Commission approving
31 the application of an electric utility to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred
32 energy accounting adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
33 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the requirements
34 for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
35 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
36 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
37 regular monthly bill or by electronic submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
38 electric utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
39 than 30 days after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
40 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
41 paragraph:
42 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public utilities. (BDR 58-572)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring [certain electric utilities to include a
cost-sharing adjustment mechanism in certain plans the utility is
required to submit to] the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada [;
establishing certain requirements for] to open one or more
investigatory dockets to examine certain matters relating to a
potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism; requiring a utility to
refund certain overcharges; revising provisions governing certain
[quarterly and annual adjustments to a required general rate
application; revising provisions governing the review of certain plans
by the Commission;] applications filed by a public utility; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires each electric utility to submit to] Section 1.3 of this bill requires
2 the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada [every 3 years an integrated resource plan] to
3 [increase the utility’s supply of electricity or decrease the demands made on its system by its
4 customers. (NRS 704.741) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require certain electric utilities to
5 include in such a plan] open one or more investigatory dockets to examine certain matters
6 relating to a potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of costs for
7 purchased fuel and purchased power and the sharing of such costs between an electric utility
8 and its customers. Section [1 also establishes certain requirements for such a cost-sharing
9 adjustment mechanism. Section 1 requires a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism to be based
10 on a forecasted estimate of costs for purchased fuel and purchased power which is made by
11 the utility, and requires the utility to provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to:
12 (1) the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission ; (2) the Bureau of Consumer
13 Protection in the Office of the Attorney General; and (3) any intervenor who signs a
14 nondisclosure agreement, including the Office of Economic Development. Section 1 provides
15 for the calculation of costs or savings based on the forecasted estimate and authorizes the
16 percentage of costs or savings which are shared between the utility and its customers to be
17 symmetrical or asymmetrical as the Commission deems necessary to incentivize the utility to
18 manage costs effectively. Section 1 requires the utility to : (1) include in its plan the financial
19 strategy employed by the utility to reduce risks which are associated with fluctuations in the
20 market; and (2) propose an annual cap on the cumulative amount of] 1.3 requires the
21 Commission to submit periodic reports to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
22 Growth and Infrastructure concerning the progress of each investigatory docket and, on

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 4
23 or before July 1, 2026, submit a final report to the Legislative Commission on the
24 outcomes of the investigatory dockets. Under section 1.3, the Commission is authorized
25 to adopt regulations to establish a cost-sharing [adjustments.] adjustment mechanism, if
26 the Commission finds it is in the public interest as a result of the investigatory docket.
27 If the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any
28 applicable rate or tariff allows, section 1.7 of this bill requires a utility to refund to the
29 customer, with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.
30 Existing law requires [certain electric utilities] the Commission to [file a general rate
31 application once every 36 months and to file certain quarterly and annual adjustments.] issue
32 a written order approving or disapproving an application filed by a public utility to
33 make any change in a schedule not later than 210 days after the date on which the
34 application is filed. (NRS [704.110, 704.187)] 704.110) Section 2 of this bill [requires the
35 quarterly and annual adjustments to take into account any cost-sharing adjustments made
36 pursuant to section 1. Existing law requires] authorizes the Commission , under certain
37 circumstances, to [issue certain orders to accept or modify, or deem inadequate any portion
38 of, the plan filed pursuant to section 4 which relates to the energy supply plan of the utility
39 within 135 days after a utility has filed the plan. (NRS 704.751) Section 5 of this bill requires
40 the Commission to issue such orders within 180 days after a utility has filed: (1) the plan; and
41 (2) any update of a portion of the plan that the Commission requires. Sections 1 and 3 of this
42 bill make section 1 applicable to] extend by not more than 90 days the time to act on such
43 an application filed by certain electric utilities.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 704 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto [a new
2 section to read] the provisions set forth as [follows:] sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this
3 act.
4 Sec. 1.3. 1. [An electric utility shall include as part of the portions of the
5 plan required by NRS 704.741 relating to the energy supply plan for the utility for
6 the 3 years covered by the plan and as part of any update to those portions that
7 the] The Commission [may require:] shall open one or more investigatory dockets
8 to:
9 (a) [A cost-sharing adjustment mechanism for the recovery of] Examine how
10 costs for purchased fuel and purchased power [that meets the requirements of
11 this section; and] are currently passed through to customers.
12 (b) [The financial strategy employed by the utility, which must be approved
13 by the Commission, to reduce risks] Examine the use of carrying charges on
14 deferred energy accounting and balances.
15 (c) Identify opportunities to mitigate the impact on customer rates which are
16 associated with fluctuations in the market for purchased fuel and purchased
17 power [.
18 2. A] or other unpredictable events which affect customer rates.
19 (d) Consider elements of a potential cost-sharing adjustment mechanism
20 [must be based on a forecasted estimate of costs] for purchased fuel and
21 purchased power which is [made by the] designed to align the financial incentives
22 of an electric utility [. An] with the interest of the customers of the electric utility
23 [shall provide reasonable access to the forecasted estimate to:
24 (a) The Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission;
25 (b) The Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
26 General; and
27 (c) Any intervenor who signs a nondisclosure agreement, including, without
28 limitation, the Office of Economic Development.

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 5
1 3. A] , including, without limitation:
2 (1) A cost-sharing [adjustment mechanism must incorporate the
3 deadband which is calculated pursuant to subsection 10 of NRS 704.110. Any]
4 percentage that is high enough to incentivize the electric utility to keep the costs
5 of purchased fuel and purchased power [, or savings on such costs, that are above
6 or below the deadband must be shared between] low, but not low enough that the
7 electric utility [and the customers of the utility as described in subsections 4 and
8 5.
9 4. The percentage of costs of purchased fuel and purchased power, or
10 savings on such costs, that are shared between an electric utility and its
11 customers pursuant to subsection 3 may be] is exposed to unreasonable levels of
12 risk and volatility.
13 (2) Whether a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism is symmetrical or
14 asymmetrical . [as the Commission deems necessary to incentivize the utility to
15 manage costs effectively.
16 5. An electric utility shall propose an annual cap on the cumulative amount
17 of cost-sharing adjustments pursuant to subsections 3 and 4, whether costs or
18 savings, which must be based on a percentage of the authorized return on the
19 equity of the electric utility and expressed in basis points representing one-
20 hundredth of a percent. If the earnings of the electric utility are:
21 (a) Below the cap, the utility may recover excess costs pursuant to
22 subsections 3 and 4 until the cap is reached; or
23 (b) Above the cap, the utility shall refund to the customers of the utility the
24 savings pursuant to subsections 3 and 4 until the cap is reached.
25 6.] (3) Whether to use a straight-sharing method or a sharing-band method.
26 (4) Whether to use a forecasted estimate of costs or historic information
27 concerning costs.
28 (5) Options to improve the transparency of any forecasted estimate of
29 costs, including the use of a forward price index and providing access to
30 forecasted estimates to interveners in proceedings of the Commission who sign
31 nondisclosure agreements.
32 (6) Implications of the inclusion of costs for purchased fuel and
33 purchased power on the participation of an electric utility in real time and day-
34 ahead markets.
35 (e) Examine existing practices for integrated resource planning and evaluate
36 options that reduce load and mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas,
37 including, without limitation, demand-side management programs which are cost
38 effective, demand response and load shifting.
39 2. Before the submission of the report required by subsection 3, the
40 Commission shall submit periodic reports on the progress of each investigatory
41 docket opened pursuant to subsection 1 to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
42 Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and
43 Infrastructure.
44 3. On or before July 1, 2026, the Commission shall submit a report on the
45 outcomes of each investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1,
46 including, without limitation, the status of any regulations adopted or considered
47 as a result of the investigatory docket, to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
48 Bureau for transmittal to the Legislative Commission.
49 4. If the Commission finds it is in the public interest, as a result of the
50 investigatory docket opened pursuant to subsection 1, the Commission may adopt
51 regulations to establish a cost-sharing adjustment mechanism.
52 5. As used in this section:

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 6
1 (a) “Cost-sharing adjustment mechanism” means a mechanism that shares
2 the risk of purchased fuel and purchased power costs between an electric utility
3 and its customers.
4 (b) [“Deadband” means a range around a performance target within which
5 the performance of an electric utility is deemed reasonable, for which
6 performance the electric utility does not receive a reward or penalty and which
7 recognizes the inherent uncertainty or margin of error in measuring and
8 calculating a given benchmark or baseline.
9 (c)] “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
10 Sec. 1.7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Commission
11 determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any applicable rate or
12 tariff allows, the utility shall refund to the customer, with interest, the full
13 amount of any overcharge.
14 Sec. 2. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to
16 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may otherwise be provided by the
17 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
18 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
19 in any schedule, including, without limitation, changes that will result in a
20 discontinuance, modification or restriction of service, the Commission shall
21 investigate the propriety of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve
22 or disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an application
23 and the application is a general rate application or an annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment application, the Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a
25 party of record.
26 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection 3, if a
27 public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in any
28 schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the date on which the
29 application is filed, issue a written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in
30 part, the proposed changes. If the public utility is an electric utility, the
31 Commission may, upon good cause, extend by not more than 90 days the time to
32 act upon the application.
33 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
34 public utility shall submit with its application a statement showing the recorded
35 results of revenues, expenses, investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12
36 months for which data were available when the application was prepared . [,
37 including, without limitation, the results of any cost-sharing adjustment
38 mechanism pursuant to section 1 of this act, if applicable.] Except as otherwise
39 provided in subsection 4, in determining whether to approve or disapprove any
40 increased rates, the Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
41 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same 12 months,
42 adjusted for increased revenues, any increased investment in facilities, increased
43 expenses for depreciation, certain other operating expenses as approved by the
44 Commission and changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
45 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become
46 effective within 6 months after the last month of those 12 months, but the public
47 utility shall not place into effect any increased rates until the changes have been
48 experienced and certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
49 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission shall also consider
50 evidence supporting expenses for depreciation, calculated on an annual basis,
51 applicable to major components of the public utility’s plant placed into service
52 during the recorded test period or the period for certification as set forth in the
53 application. Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 7
1 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date on which the
2 certification required by this subsection is filed with the Commission, or within the
3 period set forth in subsection 2, whichever time is longer, the Commission shall
4 make such order in reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter.
5 The following public utilities shall each file a general rate application pursuant to
6 this subsection based on the following schedule:
7 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties
8 shall file a general rate application:
9 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2019; and
10 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
11 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
12 704.7621.
13 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties shall file
14 a general rate application:
15 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2020; and
16 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
17 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
18 704.7621.
19 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
20 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
21 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
22 preceding 3 years and which had not filed a general rate application with the
23 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
24 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
25 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
26 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
27 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
28 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
29 either service.
30 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
31 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
32 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
33 preceding 3 years and which had filed a general rate application with the
34 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
35 before June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
36 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
37 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
38 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
39 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
40 either service.
41  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for waivers
42 pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the costs incurred by the public
43 utility in preparing and presenting the general rate application before the effective
44 date of any change in rates.
45 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to subsection 3, a
46 public utility may submit with its general rate application a statement showing the
47 effects, on an annualized basis, of all expected changes in circumstances . [,
48 including, without limitation, the results of any cost-sharing adjustment
49 mechanism pursuant to section 1 of this act, if applicable.] If such a statement is
50 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and expenses which
51 may occur within 210 days after the date on which its general rate application is
52 filed with the Commission if such expected changes in circumstances are
53 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 8
1 submits such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
2 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are reasonably known
3 and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. The Commission shall consider
4 expected changes in circumstances to be reasonably known and measurable with
5 reasonable accuracy if the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific
6 and identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns or
7 developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring to the degree, in
8 the amount and at the time expected, are primarily measurable by recorded or
9 verifiable revenues and expenses and are easily and objectively calculated, with the
10 calculation of the expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates,
11 forecasts, projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
12 utility has met its burden of proof:
13 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted pursuant to this
14 subsection and evidence relevant to the statement, including all reasonable
15 projected or forecasted offsets in revenue and expenses that are directly attributable
16 to or associated with the expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in
17 addition to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
18 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
19 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission the
20 certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 3.
21 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
22 in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a final written order regarding
23 the proposed changes within the time required by this section, the proposed changes
24 shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.
25 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
26 public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the public utility through common
27 ownership, shall not file with the Commission another general rate application until
28 all pending general rate applications filed by that public utility have been decided
29 by the Commission unless, after application and hearing, the Commission
30 determines that a substantial financial emergency would exist if the public utility or
31 its affiliate is not permitted to file another general rate application sooner. The
32 provisions of this subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
33 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an application to recover
34 the increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for
35 resale pursuant to subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8
36 or 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements pursuant to
37 NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
38 pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility is otherwise authorized to so file by
39 those provisions.
40 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the increased cost of
41 purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale once every 30
42 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to:
43 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
44 pursuant to subsection 10; or
45 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and which adjusts its
46 rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
47 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must request
48 approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between
49 annual rate adjustment applications based on changes in the public utility’s
50 recorded costs of natural gas purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases
51 natural gas for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may request
52 approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
53 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such a request not

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 9
1 later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
2 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
3 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
4 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of a public
5 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
6 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of natural gas. If the
7 balance of the public utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from
8 the public utility’s annual recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate
9 quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
10 to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
11 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate adjustments on a
12 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
13 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the Commission before the
14 public utility makes a quarterly rate adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not
15 subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the
16 requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
17 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
18 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
19 regular monthly bill or by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
20 public utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
21 than 30 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice with
22 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
23 paragraph:
24 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
25 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
26 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
27 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
28 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
29 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the public utility’s
30 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
31 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
32 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
33 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
34 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
35 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas
36 which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for
37 reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to
38 review the annual rate adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
39 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
40 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment application with the
41 Commission. The annual rate adjustment application is subject to the requirements
42 for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a
43 consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
44 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment application must
45 include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded
46 costs of natural gas included in each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment
47 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
48 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of natural gas
49 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application,
50 and the public utility has the burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the
51 proceeding.
52 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover any recorded
53 costs of natural gas which were the result of any practice or transaction that was

Assembly Amendment No. 410 to Assembly Bill No. 452 Page 10
1 unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the public
2 utility, and the Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
3 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas included in any
4 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application were not
5 reasonable or prudent.
6 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates [, in compliance with section 1 of
7 this act,] on a quarterly basis based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded
8 costs of purchased fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
9 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the Commission to
10 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment . [in
11 compliance with section 1 of this act.] The Commission shall approve or deny such
12 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission.
13 The Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of
14 the request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
15 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an electric
16 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
17 accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
18 If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent
19 from the electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or purchased
20 power which are used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy
21 accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
22 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10 [must comply
23 with section 1 of this act and] is subject to the following requirements:
24 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the Commission on or
25 before August 15, 2007, and every quarter thereafter of the quarterly rate
26 adjustment to be made by the electric utility for the following quarter. The first
27 quarterly rate adjustment by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007,
28 and each subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
29 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy accounting
30 adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by the Commission approving
31 the application of an electric utility to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred
32 energy accounting adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
33 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the requirements
34 for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
35 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
36 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
37 regular monthly bill or by electronic submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
