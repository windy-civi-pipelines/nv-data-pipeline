Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a group of five or more public or private employers,
2 under certain circumstances, to act as an association of self-insured employers for
3 the purpose of providing industrial insurance. (NRS 616B.350-616B.446)
4 Existing law requires members of such an association: (1) of public employers,
5 to be engaged in the same or similar classifications of employment; and (2) of
6 private employers, to be members or associate members of a bona fide trade
7 association, as determined by the Commissioner, which is incorporated in this State
8 and has been in existence for at least 5 years. (NRS 616B.350) Section 1 of this bill
9 additionally requires all members of an association of self-insured public or private
10 employers to perform related activities in a given industry.
11 Existing law requires an association of self-insured public or private employers
12 to be operated by a board of trustees whom the members of the association elect for
13 terms set forth in the bylaws of the association. The board of trustees must be
14 composed of: (1) for public employers, members who are officers or employees of
-
*SB345*
– 2 –
15 employers who are members of the association; and (2) for private employers, at
16 least two-thirds of members who are employees, officers or directors of the
17 members of the association. (NRS 616B.365) Section 3 of this bill requires that the
18 board of trustees of an association of self-insured: (1) public employers be officers
19 or managerial employees of the public employers who are members of the
20 association; and (2) private employers be managerial employees, officers or
21 directors of the members of the association. Section 1 requires the bylaws of an
22 association to: (1) establish a procedure for nominating persons who may be elected
23 to the board of trustees which is free from certain outside influence; and (2) contain
24 a statement of fiduciary responsibility for administering the plan of insurance.
25 Existing law requires an association of self-insured public or private employers
26 and each member of the association to execute an indemnity agreement which
27 jointly and severally binds the association and each member to secure the payment
28 of all compensation due for industrial insurance claims. (NRS 616B.350, 616B.353,
29 616B.386) Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to assess all
30 associations of self-insured public or private employers to provide for claims
31 against any insolvent association. (NRS 616B.443) Section 2 of this bill requires
32 such an indemnity agreement to: (1) authorize the association to assess certain fees
33 from members if any member defaults; and (2) notify members that the
34 Commissioner may assess the association to provide for claims against another
35 association pursuant to existing law.
36 Existing law requires an association of self-insured public or private employers
37 to: (1) collect an annual assessment from each member of the association; and (2)
38 maintain a policy of excess insurance in a form and amount required by the
39 Commissioner. (NRS 616B.353) Section 2 requires that: (1) money collected from
40 annual assessments be used only for the administration of the plan and to pay
41 claims; and (2) the required policy of excess insurance have a self-insured retention
42 of not less than $250,000. Section 2 also revises the minimum amount of a bond
43 which an association’s administrator is required to deposit with the Commissioner.
44 Section 4 of this bill requires the Commissioner, as part of an annual audit of each
45 association required by existing law, to verify the annual assessment required to be
46 paid by each member to ensure that the assessment is reasonable.
47 Existing law authorizes an association of self-insured public or private
48 employers, under certain circumstances, to declare and distribute dividends to the
49 members of the association. (NRS 616B.413) Section 5 of this bill: (1) prohibits an
50 association from declaring or distributing dividends to its members; and (2)
51 authorizes an association that has excess assets to reduce the annual assessment
52 required to be paid by each member of the association.
53 Existing law requires each association of self-insured public or private
54 employers to maintain certain reserves. (NRS 616B.419) Section 6 of this bill
55 requires an association to furnish information to the Commissioner upon request for
56 the review of such reserves.
57 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) issue orders requiring that an
58 association of self-insured public or private employers or a member of the
59 association cease and desist from engaging in certain prohibited acts; and (2)
60 enforce such orders by imposing administrative fines or withdrawing the certificate
61 of the association if the association or a member violates such an order. (NRS
62 616B.425) Section 7 of this bill additionally authorizes the Commissioner to issue
63 and enforce such cease and desist orders against the board of trustees of an
64 association, the association’s administrator or a third-party administrator employed
65 by the association.
66 Existing law also authorizes the Commissioner to impose administrative fines
67 or institute proceedings to withdraw the certificate of an association for certain
68 violations of existing law and regulations. Existing law authorizes an association
69 that is aggrieved by a decision of the Commissioner to seek judicial review.

71 make those provisions equally applicable to an association’s administrator.
72 Section 11 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations which
73 establish uniform policies for and the required contents of an underwriting plan for
74 each association of self-insured public or private employers.
75 Section 13 of this bill provides that any certificate issued by the Commissioner
76 authorizing a group of employers to act as an association of self-insured public or
77 private employers that is in effect on October 1, 2025, expires on October 1, 2026.
78 Section 13 requires an association of self-insured public or private employers that
79 wishes to continue to act as such an association after October 1, 2026, to apply for

MARCH 13, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to associations of self-
insured employers. (BDR 53-198)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising various
requirements for an association of self-insured public or
private employers, members of an association and
members of a board of trustees of an association; revising
permissible uses of money collected from members as
annual assessments; prohibiting the distribution of
dividends to members of an association by an association;
revising provisions relating to certain administrative
penalties; requiring an association of self-insured public
or private employers operating on October 1, 2025, to
apply for and be issued a new certificate to act as such an
association; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a group of five or more public or private employers,
2 under certain circumstances, to act as an association of self-insured employers for
3 the purpose of providing industrial insurance. (NRS 616B.350-616B.446)
4 Existing law requires members of such an association: (1) of public employers,
5 to be engaged in the same or similar classifications of employment; and (2) of
6 private employers, to be members or associate members of a bona fide trade
7 association, as determined by the Commissioner, which is incorporated in this State
8 and has been in existence for at least 5 years. (NRS 616B.350) Section 1 of this bill
9 additionally requires all members of an association of self-insured public or private
10 employers to perform related activities in a given industry.
11 Existing law requires an association of self-insured public or private employers
12 to be operated by a board of trustees whom the members of the association elect for
13 terms set forth in the bylaws of the association. The board of trustees must be
14 composed of: (1) for public employers, members who are officers or employees of
-
*SB345*

– 2 –
15 employers who are members of the association; and (2) for private employers, at
16 least two-thirds of members who are employees, officers or directors of the
17 members of the association. (NRS 616B.365) Section 3 of this bill requires that the
18 board of trustees of an association of self-insured: (1) public employers be officers
19 or managerial employees of the public employers who are members of the
20 association; and (2) private employers be managerial employees, officers or
21 directors of the members of the association. Section 1 requires the bylaws of an
22 association to: (1) establish a procedure for nominating persons who may be elected
23 to the board of trustees which is free from certain outside influence; and (2) contain
24 a statement of fiduciary responsibility for administering the plan of insurance.
25 Existing law requires an association of self-insured public or private employers
26 and each member of the association to execute an indemnity agreement which
27 jointly and severally binds the association and each member to secure the payment
28 of all compensation due for industrial insurance claims. (NRS 616B.350, 616B.353,
29 616B.386) Existing law authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to assess all
30 associations of self-insured public or private employers to provide for claims
31 against any insolvent association. (NRS 616B.443) Section 2 of this bill requires
32 such an indemnity agreement to: (1) authorize the association to assess certain fees
33 from members if any member defaults; and (2) notify members that the
34 Commissioner may assess the association to provide for claims against another
35 association pursuant to existing law.
36 Existing law requires an association of self-insured public or private employers
37 to: (1) collect an annual assessment from each member of the association; and (2)
38 maintain a policy of excess insurance in a form and amount required by the
39 Commissioner. (NRS 616B.353) Section 2 requires that: (1) money collected from
40 annual assessments be used only for the administration of the plan and to pay
41 claims; and (2) the required policy of excess insurance have a self-insured retention
42 of not less than $250,000. Section 2 also revises the minimum amount of a bond
43 which an association’s administrator is required to deposit with the Commissioner.
44 Section 4 of this bill requires the Commissioner, as part of an annual audit of each
45 association required by existing law, to verify the annual assessment required to be
46 paid by each member to ensure that the assessment is reasonable.
47 Existing law authorizes an association of self-insured public or private
48 employers, under certain circumstances, to declare and distribute dividends to the
49 members of the association. (NRS 616B.413) Section 5 of this bill: (1) prohibits an
50 association from declaring or distributing dividends to its members; and (2)
51 authorizes an association that has excess assets to reduce the annual assessment
52 required to be paid by each member of the association.
53 Existing law requires each association of self-insured public or private
54 employers to maintain certain reserves. (NRS 616B.419) Section 6 of this bill
55 requires an association to furnish information to the Commissioner upon request for
56 the review of such reserves.
57 Existing law authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) issue orders requiring that an
58 association of self-insured public or private employers or a member of the
59 association cease and desist from engaging in certain prohibited acts; and (2)
60 enforce such orders by imposing administrative fines or withdrawing the certificate
61 of the association if the association or a member violates such an order. (NRS
62 616B.425) Section 7 of this bill additionally authorizes the Commissioner to issue
63 and enforce such cease and desist orders against the board of trustees of an
64 association, the association’s administrator or a third-party administrator employed
65 by the association.
66 Existing law also authorizes the Commissioner to impose administrative fines
67 or institute proceedings to withdraw the certificate of an association for certain
68 violations of existing law and regulations. Existing law authorizes an association
69 that is aggrieved by a decision of the Commissioner to seek judicial review.

71 make those provisions equally applicable to an association’s administrator.
72 Section 11 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations which
73 establish uniform policies for and the required contents of an underwriting plan for
74 each association of self-insured public or private employers.
75 Section 13 of this bill provides that any certificate issued by the Commissioner
76 authorizing a group of employers to act as an association of self-insured public or
77 private employers that is in effect on October 1, 2025, expires on October 1, 2026.
78 Section 13 requires an association of self-insured public or private employers that
