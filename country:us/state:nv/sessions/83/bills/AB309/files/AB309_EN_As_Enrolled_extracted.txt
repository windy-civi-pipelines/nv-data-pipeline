CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to orders for protection; requiring certain
temporary orders for protection against domestic violence to
include certain information; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) authorizes a court to grant a temporary order for protection
against domestic violence with or without notice to the adverse party; and (2)
provides that an extended order for protection against domestic violence may only
be granted after notice to the adverse party and a hearing on the application. Under
existing law, if a court grants a temporary order for protection against domestic
violence against an alleged perpetrator of domestic violence who is in custody at
the time the court grants the order: (1) upon approval of the court, the signed order
may be transmitted to the facility holding the alleged perpetrator; and (2) if such an
order is received by the facility holding the alleged perpetrator while the alleged
perpetrator is still in custody, the order must be served upon the alleged perpetrator
before the alleged perpetrator is released from the facility. (NRS 33.020)

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill requires that certain temporary orders for protection
against domestic violence served upon an alleged perpetrator who is in custody
advise the person that if the person is still in custody on the date of the hearing on
the application for an extended order for protection against domestic violence, the
person may contest the application by filing a written response with the court which
consists solely of a statement indicating whether the person contests the issuance of
an extended order. Section 1 also requires that such temporary orders notify the
person that if the person does not file a written response within the time specified in
the temporary order and the person is still in custody on the date of the hearing on
the application for an extended order for protection against domestic violence, the
court may: (1) hold the hearing in the absence of the incarcerated person; and (2)
grant the extended order without further input from the incarcerated person.
