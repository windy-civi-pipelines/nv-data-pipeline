EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to orders for protection; requiring certain temporary orders for
protection against domestic violence to include certain information;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes a court to grant a temporary order for protection against
2 domestic violence with or without notice to the adverse party; and (2) provides that an
3 extended order for protection against domestic violence may only be granted after notice to
4 the adverse party and a hearing on the application. Under existing law, if a court grants a
5 temporary order for protection against domestic violence against an alleged perpetrator of
6 domestic violence who is in custody at the time the court grants the order: (1) upon approval
7 of the court, the signed order may be transmitted to the facility holding the alleged perpetrator;
8 and (2) if such an order is received by the facility holding the alleged perpetrator while the
9 alleged perpetrator is still in custody, the order must be served upon the alleged perpetrator
10 before the alleged perpetrator is released from the facility. (NRS 33.020)
11 Section 1 of this bill requires that certain temporary orders for protection against
12 domestic violence served upon an alleged perpetrator who is in custody advise the person that
13 if the person is still in custody on the date of the hearing on the application for an extended
14 order for protection against domestic violence, the person may contest the application by
15 filing [an affidavit] a written response with the court which [states the reasons why] consists
16 solely of a statement indicating whether the [court should not grant the] person contests
17 the issuance of an extended order. Section 1 also requires that such temporary orders notify
18 the person that if the person does not file [an affidavit] a written response within the time
19 specified in the temporary order and the person is still in custody on the date of the hearing on
20 the application for an extended order for protection against domestic violence, the court may:
21 (1) hold the hearing in the absence of the incarcerated person; and (2) grant the extended order
22 without further input from the incarcerated person.

5 (b) Exclude the adverse party from the applicant’s place of residence;
6 (c) Prohibit the adverse party from entering the residence, school or place of
7 employment of the applicant or minor child and order the adverse party to stay

9 (d) If it has jurisdiction under chapter 125A of NRS, grant temporary custody
10 of the minor child to the applicant;

18 2. The court by an extended order may grant any relief enumerated in
