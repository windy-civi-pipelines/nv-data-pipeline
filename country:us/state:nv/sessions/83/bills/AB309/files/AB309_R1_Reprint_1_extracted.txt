AN ACT relating to orders for protection; requiring certain
temporary orders for protection against domestic violence
to include certain information; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes a court to grant a temporary order for protection
2 against domestic violence with or without notice to the adverse party; and (2)
3 provides that an extended order for protection against domestic violence may only
4 be granted after notice to the adverse party and a hearing on the application. Under
5 existing law, if a court grants a temporary order for protection against domestic
6 violence against an alleged perpetrator of domestic violence who is in custody at
7 the time the court grants the order: (1) upon approval of the court, the signed order
8 may be transmitted to the facility holding the alleged perpetrator; and (2) if such an
9 order is received by the facility holding the alleged perpetrator while the alleged
10 perpetrator is still in custody, the order must be served upon the alleged perpetrator
11 before the alleged perpetrator is released from the facility. (NRS 33.020)
12 Section 1 of this bill requires that certain temporary orders for protection
13 against domestic violence served upon an alleged perpetrator who is in custody
14 advise the person that if the person is still in custody on the date of the hearing on
15 the application for an extended order for protection against domestic violence, the
16 person may contest the application by filing a written response with the court which
17 consists solely of a statement indicating whether the person contests the issuance of
18 an extended order. Section 1 also requires that such temporary orders notify the
19 person that if the person does not file a written response within the time specified in
20 the temporary order and the person is still in custody on the date of the hearing on

21 the application for an extended order for protection against domestic violence, the
22 court may: (1) hold the hearing in the absence of the incarcerated person; and (2)
23 grant the extended order without further input from the incarcerated person.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 33.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 33.030 1. The court by a temporary order may:
3 (a) Enjoin the adverse party from threatening, physically
4 injuring or harassing the applicant or minor child, either directly or
5 through an agent;
6 (b) Exclude the adverse party from the applicant’s place of
7 residence;
8 (c) Prohibit the adverse party from entering the residence,
9 school or place of employment of the applicant or minor child and
10 order the adverse party to stay away from any specified place
11 frequented regularly by them;
12 (d) If it has jurisdiction under chapter 125A of NRS, grant
13 temporary custody of the minor child to the applicant;
14 (e) Enjoin the adverse party from physically injuring,
15 threatening to injure or taking possession of any animal that is
16 owned or kept by the applicant or minor child, either directly or
17 through an agent;
18 (f) Enjoin the adverse party from physically injuring or
19 threatening to injure any animal that is owned or kept by the adverse
20 party, either directly or through an agent; and
21 (g) Order such other relief as it deems necessary in an
22 emergency situation.
23 2. The court by an extended order may grant any relief
24 enumerated in subsection 1 and:
25 (a) Specify arrangements for visitation of the minor child by the
26 adverse party and require supervision of that visitation by a third
27 party if necessary;
28 (b) Specify arrangements for the possession and care of any
29 animal owned or kept by the adverse party, applicant or minor child;
30 and
31 (c) Order the adverse party to:
32 (1) Avoid or limit communication with the applicant or
33 minor child;
34 (2) Pay rent or make payments on a mortgage on the
35 applicant’s place of residence;
36 (3) Pay for the support of the applicant or minor child,

5 bringing the action; and
6 (5) Pay monetary compensation to the applicant for lost
7 earnings and expenses incurred as a result of the applicant attending
8 any hearing concerning an application for an extended order.
9 3. If an extended order is issued by a justice court, an
10 interlocutory appeal lies to the district court, which may affirm,
11 modify or vacate the order in question. The appeal may be taken
12 without bond, but its taking does not stay the effect or enforcement
13 of the order.
14 4. A temporary or extended order must specify, as applicable,
15 the county and city, if any, in which the residence, school, child care
16 facility or other provider of child care, and place of employment of
17 the applicant or minor child are located.
18 5. A temporary or extended order must provide notice that:
19 (a) Responding to a communication initiated by the applicant
20 may constitute a violation of the protective order; and
21 (b) A person who is arrested for violating the order will not be
22 admitted to bail sooner than 12 hours after the person’s arrest if:
23 (1) The arresting officer determines that such a violation is
24 accompanied by a direct or indirect threat of harm;
25 (2) The person has previously violated a temporary or
26 extended order for protection; or
27 (3) At the time of the violation or within 2 hours after the
28 violation, the person has:
29 (I) A concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in the
30 person’s blood or breath; or
31 (II) An amount of a prohibited substance in the person’s
32 blood or urine, as applicable, that is equal to or greater than the
33 amount set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of NRS 484C.110.
34 6. In addition to the requirements prescribed by subsection 5,
35 if an application for an extended order is filed at the same time as
36 a temporary order issued pursuant to subsection 8 of NRS 33.020,
37 the temporary order must:
38 (a) Advise the incarcerated adverse party that if the
39 incarcerated adverse party is still in custody on the date of the
40 hearing on the application for an extended order, the incarcerated
41 adverse party may contest the application by filing a written
42 response with the court. The written response must:
