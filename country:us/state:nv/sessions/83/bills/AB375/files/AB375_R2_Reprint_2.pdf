EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to intoxicating liquor; authorizing the board of
county commissioners of a county and the governing
body of an incorporated city to enact an ordinance
authorizing certain food establishments to sell or deliver
alcoholic beverages for consumption off the premises of
the establishment under certain circumstances; requiring
the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations imposing
a surcharge on such sales; revising provisions relating to
craft distilleries; designating the Picon Punch as the
official state drink of the State of Nevada; expanding the
functions of the Ignition Interlock Program established by
the Director of the Department of Public Safety; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by
2 the drink for consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090,
3 369.620) Existing law also authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support
4 service acting on behalf of a retail liquor store, to deliver liquor, in its original
5 package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale of such liquor under certain
6 circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
7 Section 1 of this bill defines “covered food establishment” to mean, in general,
8 a food establishment that prepares and serves food on the premises and which is
9 licensed to sell at retail alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
10 Section 1 authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county or the
11 governing body of an incorporated city to enact an ordinance authorizing, under
12 such conditions as may be imposed by the ordinance, a covered food establishment
13 to sell at retail an alcoholic beverage in a container sealed by the establishment for
14 consumption off the premises of the establishment. Section 1 also authorizes the
-
*AB375_R2*

– 2 –
15 ordinance to authorize a covered food establishment, or a delivery support service
16 acting on behalf of such an establishment, to deliver alcoholic beverages in a
17 container sealed by the establishment to a consumer in connection with the retail
18 sale of such an alcoholic beverage. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill exempt such
19 deliveries from certain provisions of law governing the transport of liquor.
20 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Public Safety to
21 establish the Ignition Interlock Program. Existing law creates the Account for the
22 Ignition Interlock Program. Permissible uses of money in the Account include
23 treatment assistance, outreach programs, educational programs and training and
24 enforcement activities relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or a
25 prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.454) Section 5.5 of this bill changes the name of
26 the Program to the Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction Program and expands the
27 purposes for which money in the Account may be used.
28 Section 1 requires the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations that provide
29 for the imposition and collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each
30 retail sale of an alcoholic beverage pursuant to section 1. Section 1 requires the
31 revenues collected from the surcharge to be distributed: (1) to the Department in an
32 amount determined to be necessary by the Department to pay the costs of the
33 Department in carrying out the provisions of section 1, which must not exceed
34 $250,000 each year; and (2) if any money remains, to the Account for the Ignition
35 Interlock and DUI Reduction Program to be used for the purposes for which the
36 money in the Account is used.
37 Existing law requires the Department to prescribe by regulation certain
38 requirements for the issuance of a permissible person’s certificate to any person or
39 representative of any institution, school, hospital or church desiring to import liquor
40 for industrial, medical, scientific or sacramental purposes. (NRS 369.440) Section
41 1.5 of this bill provides for the issuance of a permissible person’s certificate to a
42 person who operates a craft distillery, who has a contractual right that was created
43 before January 1, 2025, to exclusively manufacture a particular formula of distilled
44 spirit and who is desiring to import neutral or distilled spirits for the purpose of
45 manufacturing that distilled spirit. Section 5.7 of this bill designates such a distilled
46 spirit manufactured by a person who has been issued a permissible person’s
47 certificate as an “exclusive distilled spirit.”
48 Existing law sets forth the activities in which a person who operates a craft
49 distillery is authorized to engage. Existing law limits the amount of distilled spirits
50 that such a person may manufacture for exportation to another state to not more
51 than 40,000 cases in any calendar year. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7 authorizes a
52 person who operates a craft distillery and who has obtained a permissible person’s
53 certificate to manufacture an additional 40,000 cases of an exclusive distilled spirit
54 of the person for exportation to another state.
55 Existing law requires a person who operates a craft distillery to ensure that
56 none of the spirits manufactured at the craft distillery are derived from neutral or
57 distilled spirits manufactured by another manufacturer. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7
58 authorizes a person who operates a craft distillery and who has obtained a
59 permissible person’s certificate to manufacture an exclusive distilled spirit of the
60 person using neutral or distilled spirits manufactured by another manufacturer.
61 Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS
62 235.020-235.140) Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink
63 known as the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of Nevada.
