AN ACT relating to intoxicating liquor; authorizing the board of county
commissioners of a county and the governing body of an

establishments to sell or deliver [mixed drinks] alcoholic beverages
for consumption off the premises of the establishment under certain
circumstances; [revising the required curriculum for an alcoholic

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink for
2 consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090, 369.620) Existing law also
3 authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support service acting on behalf of a retail liquor
4 store, to deliver liquor, in its original package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale
5 of such liquor under certain circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
6 Section 1 of this bill defines “covered food establishment” to mean, in general, a food
7 establishment that prepares and serves food on the premises and which is licensed to sell
8 at retail alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Section 1 authorizes [an
9 establishment that sells alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises to
10 sell certain mixed drinks,] the board of county commissioners of a county or the governing
11 body of an incorporated city to enact an ordinance authorizing, under such conditions as
12 may be imposed by the ordinance, a covered food establishment to sell at retail an
13 alcoholic beverage in a [sealed] container [,] sealed by the manufacturer or the
14 establishment for consumption off the premises of the establishment. Section 1 also
15 authorizes [such an] the ordinance to authorize a covered food establishment, or a delivery
16 support service acting on behalf of such an establishment, to deliver [certain mixed drinks,]
17 alcoholic beverages in a [sealed] container [,] sealed by the manufacturer or the
18 establishment to a consumer in connection with the retail sale of such [a mixed drink. Section
19 1 requires such a delivery to take place in a jurisdiction where the establishment is licensed to
20 sell liquor at retail. Section 3 of this bill revises the term “establishment” to include a business

Assembly Amendment No. 441 to Assembly Bill No. 375 Page 4
21 that sells such a mixed drink in compliance with the requirements of section 1.] an alcoholic
22 beverage. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill exempt such deliveries from certain provisions of law
23 governing the transport of liquor. [Section 1 requires the Department of Taxation to adopt
24 certain regulations governing such deliveries. Section 1 authorizes the city council or other
25 governing body of each incorporated city in this State to enact an ordinance: (1) which
26 establishes additional reasonable requirements, permits or fees relating to the activities
27 described in section 1; or (2) to opt out of and prohibit the activities described in section 1.]
28 Existing law [establishes the Account for the] requires the Director of the Department
29 of Public Safety to establish the Ignition Interlock Program. Existing law creates the
30 Account for the Ignition Interlock Program. Permissible uses of money in the Account
31 include treatment assistance, outreach programs, educational programs and training and
32 enforcement activities relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
33 substance. (NRS 484C.454) Section 5.5 of this bill changes the name of the Program to the
34 Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction Program and expands the purposes for which
35 money in the Account may be used. Section 1 requires [, as part of the regulations which]
36 the Department [is required] of Taxation to adopt [,] regulations that provide for the
37 imposition and collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each retail sale of [a
38 mixed drink] an alcoholic beverage pursuant to section 1, which must be used for the
39 purposes for which the money in the Account is used.
40 [Existing law requires certain employees to successfully complete an alcoholic beverage
41 awareness program and prescribes the requirements for such a program. (NRS 369.625,
42 369.630) Section 4 of this bill requires the curriculum of such a program to include instruction
43 on packaging and delivery of mixed drinks pursuant to section 1.]
44 Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS 235.020-235.140)
45 Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink known as the Picon Punch as the
46 official state drink of the State of Nevada.
