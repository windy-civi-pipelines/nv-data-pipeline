EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to intoxicating liquor; authorizing the board of
county commissioners of a county and the governing
body of an incorporated city to enact an ordinance
authorizing certain food establishments to sell or deliver
alcoholic beverages for consumption off the premises of
the establishment under certain circumstances; requiring
the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations imposing
a surcharge on such sales; designating the Picon Punch as
the official state drink of the State of Nevada; expanding
the functions of the Ignition Interlock Program
established by the Director of the Department of Public
Safety; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by
2 the drink for consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090,
3 369.620) Existing law also authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support
4 service acting on behalf of a retail liquor store, to deliver liquor, in its original
5 package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale of such liquor under certain
6 circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
7 Section 1 of this bill defines “covered food establishment” to mean, in general,
8 a food establishment that prepares and serves food on the premises and which is
9 licensed to sell at retail alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
10 Section 1 authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county or the
11 governing body of an incorporated city to enact an ordinance authorizing, under
12 such conditions as may be imposed by the ordinance, a covered food establishment
13 to sell at retail an alcoholic beverage in a container sealed by the manufacturer or
14 the establishment for consumption off the premises of the establishment. Section 1

15 also authorizes the ordinance to authorize a covered food establishment, or a
16 delivery support service acting on behalf of such an establishment, to deliver
17 alcoholic beverages in a container sealed by the manufacturer or the establishment
18 to a consumer in connection with the retail sale of such an alcoholic beverage.
19 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill exempt such deliveries from certain provisions of law
20 governing the transport of liquor.
21 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Public Safety to
22 establish the Ignition Interlock Program. Existing law creates the Account for the
23 Ignition Interlock Program. Permissible uses of money in the Account include
24 treatment assistance, outreach programs, educational programs and training and
25 enforcement activities relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or a
26 prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.454) Section 5.5 of this bill changes the name of
27 the Program to the Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction Program and expands the
28 purposes for which money in the Account may be used. Section 1 requires the
29 Department of Taxation to adopt regulations that provide for the imposition and
30 collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each retail sale of an alcoholic
31 beverage pursuant to section 1, which must be used for the purposes for which the
32 money in the Account is used.
33 Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS
34 235.020-235.140) Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink
35 known as the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of Nevada.
