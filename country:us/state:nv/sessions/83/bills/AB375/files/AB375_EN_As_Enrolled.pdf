CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to intoxicating liquor; authorizing the board of
county commissioners of a county and the governing body of
an incorporated city to enact an ordinance authorizing certain
food establishments to sell or deliver alcoholic beverages for
consumption off the premises of the establishment under
certain circumstances; requiring the Department of Taxation
to adopt regulations imposing a surcharge on such sales;
revising provisions relating to craft distilleries; designating
the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of
Nevada; expanding the functions of the Ignition Interlock
Program established by the Director of the Department of
Public Safety; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by
the drink for consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090,
369.620) Existing law also authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support
service acting on behalf of a retail liquor store, to deliver liquor, in its original
package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale of such liquor under certain
circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
Section 1 of this bill defines “covered food establishment” to mean, in general,
a food establishment that prepares and serves food on the premises and which is
licensed to sell at retail alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
Section 1 authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county or the
governing body of an incorporated city to enact an ordinance authorizing, under
such conditions as may be imposed by the ordinance, a covered food establishment
to sell at retail an alcoholic beverage in a container sealed by the establishment for
consumption off the premises of the establishment. Section 1 also authorizes the
ordinance to authorize a covered food establishment, or a delivery support service
acting on behalf of such an establishment, to deliver alcoholic beverages in a
container sealed by the establishment to a consumer in connection with the retail
sale of such an alcoholic beverage. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill exempt such
deliveries from certain provisions of law governing the transport of liquor.
Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Public Safety to
establish the Ignition Interlock Program. Existing law creates the Account for the
Ignition Interlock Program. Permissible uses of money in the Account include
treatment assistance, outreach programs, educational programs and training and
enforcement activities relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or a
prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.454) Section 5.5 of this bill changes the name of
the Program to the Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction Program and expands the
purposes for which money in the Account may be used.
Section 1 requires the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations that provide
for the imposition and collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each
retail sale of an alcoholic beverage pursuant to section 1. Section 1 requires the
revenues collected from the surcharge to be distributed: (1) to the Department in an
amount determined to be necessary by the Department to pay the costs of the
Department in carrying out the provisions of section 1, which must not exceed

– 2 –
$250,000 each year; and (2) if any money remains, to the Account for the Ignition
Interlock and DUI Reduction Program to be used for the purposes for which the
money in the Account is used.
Existing law requires the Department to prescribe by regulation certain
requirements for the issuance of a permissible person’s certificate to any person or
representative of any institution, school, hospital or church desiring to import liquor
for industrial, medical, scientific or sacramental purposes. (NRS 369.440) Section
1.5 of this bill provides for the issuance of a permissible person’s certificate to a
person who operates a craft distillery, who has a contractual right that was created
before January 1, 2025, to exclusively manufacture a particular formula of distilled
spirit and who is desiring to import neutral or distilled spirits for the purpose of
manufacturing that distilled spirit. Section 5.7 of this bill designates such a distilled
spirit manufactured by a person who has been issued a permissible person’s
certificate as an “exclusive distilled spirit.”
Existing law sets forth the activities in which a person who operates a craft
distillery is authorized to engage. Existing law limits the amount of distilled spirits
that such a person may manufacture for exportation to another state to not more
than 40,000 cases in any calendar year. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7 authorizes a
person who operates a craft distillery and who has obtained a permissible person’s
certificate to manufacture an additional 40,000 cases of an exclusive distilled spirit
of the person for exportation to another state.
Existing law requires a person who operates a craft distillery to ensure that
none of the spirits manufactured at the craft distillery are derived from neutral or
distilled spirits manufactured by another manufacturer. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7
authorizes a person who operates a craft distillery and who has obtained a
permissible person’s certificate to manufacture an exclusive distilled spirit of the
person using neutral or distilled spirits manufactured by another manufacturer.
Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS
235.020-235.140) Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink
known as the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of Nevada.
