EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to intoxicating liquor; authorizing the board of county
commissioners of a county and the governing body of an incorporated
city to enact an ordinance authorizing certain food establishments to
sell or deliver alcoholic beverages for consumption off the premises of
the establishment under certain circumstances; requiring the
Department of Taxation to adopt regulations imposing a surcharge on
such sales; revising provisions relating to craft distilleries;
designating the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of
Nevada; expanding the functions of the Ignition Interlock Program
established by the Director of the Department of Public Safety; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink for
2 consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090, 369.620) Existing law also
3 authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support service acting on behalf of a retail liquor
4 store, to deliver liquor, in its original package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale
5 of such liquor under certain circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
6 Section 1 of this bill defines “covered food establishment” to mean, in general, a food
7 establishment that prepares and serves food on the premises and which is licensed to sell at
8 retail alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Section 1 authorizes the board of
9 county commissioners of a county or the governing body of an incorporated city to enact an
10 ordinance authorizing, under such conditions as may be imposed by the ordinance, a covered
11 food establishment to sell at retail an alcoholic beverage in a container sealed by [the
12 manufacturer or] the establishment for consumption off the premises of the establishment.
13 Section 1 also authorizes the ordinance to authorize a covered food establishment, or a
14 delivery support service acting on behalf of such an establishment, to deliver alcoholic
15 beverages in a container sealed by [the manufacturer or] the establishment to a consumer in
16 connection with the retail sale of such an alcoholic beverage. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
17 exempt such deliveries from certain provisions of law governing the transport of liquor.
18 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Public Safety to establish the
19 Ignition Interlock Program. Existing law creates the Account for the Ignition Interlock
20 Program. Permissible uses of money in the Account include treatment assistance, outreach
21 programs, educational programs and training and enforcement activities relating to driving
22 under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.454) Section 5.5 of this
Assembly Amendment No. 827 to Assembly Bill No. 375 First Reprint Page 4
23 bill changes the name of the Program to the Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction Program
24 and expands the purposes for which money in the Account may be used.
25 Section 1 requires the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations that provide for the
26 imposition and collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each retail sale of an
27 alcoholic beverage pursuant to section 1 . [, which must] Section 1 requires the revenues
28 collected from the surcharge to be distributed: (1) to the Department in an amount
29 determined to be necessary by the Department to pay the costs of the Department in
30 carrying out the provisions of section 1, which must not exceed $250,000 each year; and
31 (2) if any money remains, to the Account for the Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction
32 Program to be used for the purposes for which the money in the Account is used.
33 Existing law requires the Department to prescribe by regulation certain
34 requirements for the issuance of a permissible person’s certificate to any person or
35 representative of any institution, school, hospital or church desiring to import liquor for
36 industrial, medical, scientific or sacramental purposes. (NRS 369.440) Section 1.5 of this
37 bill provides for the issuance of a permissible person’s certificate to a person who
38 operates a craft distillery, who has a contractual right that was created before January
39 1, 2025, to exclusively manufacture a particular formula of distilled spirit and who is
40 desiring to import neutral or distilled spirits for the purpose of manufacturing that
41 distilled spirit. Section 5.7 of this bill designates such a distilled spirit manufactured by a
42 person who has been issued a permissible person’s certificate as an “exclusive distilled
43 spirit.”
44 Existing law sets forth the activities in which a person who operates a craft distillery
45 is authorized to engage. Existing law limits the amount of distilled spirits that such a
46 person may manufacture for exportation to another state to not more than 40,000 cases
47 in any calendar year. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7 authorizes a person who operates a craft
48 distillery and who has obtained a permissible person’s certificate to manufacture an
49 additional 40,000 cases of an exclusive distilled spirit of the person for exportation to
50 another state.
51 Existing law requires a person who operates a craft distillery to ensure that none of
52 the spirits manufactured at the craft distillery are derived from neutral or distilled
53 spirits manufactured by another manufacturer. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7 authorizes a
54 person who operates a craft distillery and who has obtained a permissible person’s
55 certificate to manufacture an exclusive distilled spirit of the person using neutral or
56 distilled spirits manufactured by another manufacturer.
57 Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS 235.020-235.140)
58 Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink known as the Picon Punch as the
59 official state drink of the State of Nevada.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to intoxicating liquor; authorizing the board of county
commissioners of a county and the governing body of an incorporated
city to enact an ordinance authorizing certain food establishments to
sell or deliver alcoholic beverages for consumption off the premises of
the establishment under certain circumstances; requiring the
Department of Taxation to adopt regulations imposing a surcharge on
such sales; revising provisions relating to craft distilleries;
designating the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of
Nevada; expanding the functions of the Ignition Interlock Program
established by the Director of the Department of Public Safety; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink for
2 consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090, 369.620) Existing law also
3 authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support service acting on behalf of a retail liquor
4 store, to deliver liquor, in its original package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale
5 of such liquor under certain circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
6 Section 1 of this bill defines “covered food establishment” to mean, in general, a food
7 establishment that prepares and serves food on the premises and which is licensed to sell at
8 retail alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Section 1 authorizes the board of
9 county commissioners of a county or the governing body of an incorporated city to enact an
10 ordinance authorizing, under such conditions as may be imposed by the ordinance, a covered
11 food establishment to sell at retail an alcoholic beverage in a container sealed by [the
12 manufacturer or] the establishment for consumption off the premises of the establishment.
13 Section 1 also authorizes the ordinance to authorize a covered food establishment, or a
14 delivery support service acting on behalf of such an establishment, to deliver alcoholic
15 beverages in a container sealed by [the manufacturer or] the establishment to a consumer in
16 connection with the retail sale of such an alcoholic beverage. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
17 exempt such deliveries from certain provisions of law governing the transport of liquor.
18 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Public Safety to establish the
19 Ignition Interlock Program. Existing law creates the Account for the Ignition Interlock
20 Program. Permissible uses of money in the Account include treatment assistance, outreach
21 programs, educational programs and training and enforcement activities relating to driving
22 under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.454) Section 5.5 of this

Assembly Amendment No. 827 to Assembly Bill No. 375 First Reprint Page 4
23 bill changes the name of the Program to the Ignition Interlock and DUI Reduction Program
24 and expands the purposes for which money in the Account may be used.
25 Section 1 requires the Department of Taxation to adopt regulations that provide for the
26 imposition and collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each retail sale of an

47 in any calendar year. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7 authorizes a person who operates a craft
48 distillery and who has obtained a permissible person’s certificate to manufacture an
49 additional 40,000 cases of an exclusive distilled spirit of the person for exportation to
50 another state.
51 Existing law requires a person who operates a craft distillery to ensure that none of
52 the spirits manufactured at the craft distillery are derived from neutral or distilled
53 spirits manufactured by another manufacturer. (NRS 597.235) Section 5.7 authorizes a
54 person who operates a craft distillery and who has obtained a permissible person’s
55 certificate to manufacture an exclusive distilled spirit of the person using neutral or
56 distilled spirits manufactured by another manufacturer.
57 Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS 235.020-235.140)
58 Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink known as the Picon Punch as the
59 official state drink of the State of Nevada.
