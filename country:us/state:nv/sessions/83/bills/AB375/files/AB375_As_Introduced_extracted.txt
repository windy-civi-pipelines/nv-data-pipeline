Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain establishments to sell alcoholic beverages by
2 the drink for consumption on the premises of the establishment. (NRS 369.090,
3 369.620) Existing law also authorizes a retail liquor store, or a delivery support
4 service acting on behalf of a retail liquor store, to deliver liquor, in its original
5 package, to a consumer in connection with a retail sale of such liquor under certain
6 circumstances. (NRS 369.489)
7 Section 1 of this bill authorizes an establishment that sells alcoholic beverages
8 by the drink for consumption on the premises to sell certain mixed drinks, in a
9 sealed container, for consumption off the premises of the establishment. Section 1
10 also authorizes such an establishment, or a delivery support service acting on behalf
11 of such an establishment, to deliver certain mixed drinks, in a sealed container, to a
12 consumer in connection with the retail sale of such a mixed drink. Section 1
13 requires such a delivery to take place in a jurisdiction where the establishment is
14 licensed to sell liquor at retail. Section 3 of this bill revises the term
15 “establishment” to include a business that sells such a mixed drink in compliance
16 with the requirements of section 1. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill exempt such
17 deliveries from certain provisions of law governing the transport of liquor. Section
18 1 requires the Department of Taxation to adopt certain regulations governing such
19 deliveries. Section 1 authorizes the city council or other governing body of each
20 incorporated city in this State to enact an ordinance: (1) which establishes
-

21 additional reasonable requirements, permits or fees relating to the activities
22 described in section 1; or (2) to opt out of and prohibit the activities described in
23 section 1.
24 Existing law establishes the Account for the Ignition Interlock Program.
25 Permissible uses of money in the Account include treatment assistance, outreach
26 programs, educational programs and training and enforcement activities relating to
27 driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.454)
28 Section 1 requires, as part of the regulations which the Department is required to
29 adopt, the imposition and collection of a surcharge, not to exceed 50 cents for each
30 retail sale of a mixed drink pursuant to section 1, which must be used for the
31 purposes for which the money in the Account is used.
32 Existing law requires certain employees to successfully complete an alcoholic
33 beverage awareness program and prescribes the requirements for such a program.
34 (NRS 369.625, 369.630) Section 4 of this bill requires the curriculum of such a
35 program to include instruction on packaging and delivery of mixed drinks pursuant
36 to section 1.
37 Existing law establishes various symbols of the State of Nevada. (NRS
38 235.020-235.140) Section 5 of this bill designates the traditional Basque drink
39 known as the Picon Punch as the official state drink of the State of Nevada.
