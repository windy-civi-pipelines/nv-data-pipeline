EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; [enhancing the criminal penalty for certain crimes
committed on the property of a resort hotel; limiting the imposition of
certain additional penalties under certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to aggregated sentences;] revising provisions
relating to [the exclusion or rejection of persons from certain licensed
gaming establishments;] warnings against trespassing; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law provides that a person who commits a crime under certain specified
2 circumstances may be subject to an additional penalty related to the commission of the crime.
3 (NRS 193.161-193.1685) Section 1 of this bill provides that a person who commits a crime on
4 the property of a resort hotel shall, in addition to the term of imprisonment prescribed by
5 statute for the crime, be punished by a term that is equal to the term of imprisonment
6 prescribed by statute for the crime. Section 1 defines “resort hotel” as any building or group of
7 buildings that is maintained as and held out to the public to be a hotel where sleeping
8 accommodations are furnished to the transient public and that has: (1) more than 200 rooms
9 available for sleeping accommodations; (2) at least one bar with seating capacity for more
10 than 30 patrons that serves alcoholic beverages sold by the drink for consumption on the
11 premises; (3) at least one restaurant with seating capacity of more than 60 patrons that is open
12 to the public 24 hours each day and 7 days each week; and (4) a gaming area within the
13 building or group of buildings.
14 Existing law provides that a person who has been sentenced to an additional term of
15 imprisonment under certain circumstances may not also be sentenced to certain other
16 additional terms of imprisonment. (NRS 193.169) Section 2 of this bill provides that the
17 additional penalty related to crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel is also subject
18 to this limitation.
19 Existing law provides that if a court imposes certain additional terms of imprisonment,
20 the sentence must be aggregated with the sentenced imposed for the underlying offense. (NRS
21 176.035) Section 3 of this bill provides that the additional penalty related to crimes committed
22 on the property of a resort hotel is subject to this requirement.
23 Existing law authorizes the Nevada Gaming Commission to establish a list of persons
24 who are required to be excluded or ejected from certain licensed gaming establishments.
25 Existing law authorizes the Commission and Nevada Gaming Control Board to consider
Senate Amendment No. 256 to Senate Bill No. 371 Page 4
26 certain factors in determining whether to include a person on the list. (NRS 463.151) In
27 addition to the existing factors, section 4 of this bill provides that the Commission and Board
28 may also consider a second or subsequent prior conviction of a crime for which the additional
29 penalty related to crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel was imposed by the
30 court.] Existing law provides that any person who, under circumstances not amounting
31 to a burglary, willfully goes or remains upon any land or in any building after having
32 been warned during the previous 24 months by the owner or occupant thereof not to
33 trespass is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 207.200) Section 5 of this bill extends the
34 period relating to such a warning from 24 months to 36 months.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. [Chapter 193 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 193.169, any person who commits a
4 crime on the property of a resort hotel shall, in addition to the term of
5 imprisonment prescribed by statute for the crime, be punished:
6 (a) If the crime is a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, by imprisonment in
7 the county jail for a term equal to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute
8 for the crime; and
9 (b) If the crime is a felony, by imprisonment in the state prison for a term
10 equal to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute for the crime.
11 2. In determining the length of the additional penalty imposed pursuant to
12 this section, the court shall consider the following information:
13 (a) The facts and circumstances of the crime;
14 (b) The criminal history of the person;
15 (c) The impact of the crime on any victim;
16 (d) Any mitigating factors presented by the person; and
17 (e) Any other relevant information.
18  The court shall state on the record that it has considered the information
19 described in paragraphs (a) to (e), inclusive, in determining the length of the
20 additional penalty imposed.
21 3. The sentence prescribed by this section:
22 (a) Must not exceed the sentence imposed for the crime; and
23 (b) Must run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by statute for the
24 crime.
25 4. This section does not create a separate offense but provides an additional
26 penalty for the primary offense, whose imposition is contingent upon the finding
27 of the prescribed fact.
28 5. As used in this section, “resort hotel” means any building or group of
29 buildings that is maintained as and held out to the public to be a hotel where
30 sleeping accommodations are furnished to the transient public and that has:

1 Sec. 2. [NRS 193.169 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 193.169 1. A person who is sentenced to an additional term of
3 imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 193.161, NRS
4 193.162, 193.163, 193.165, 193.166, 193.167, 193.1675, 193.1677, 193.1678,
5 193.168, subsection 1 of NRS 193.1685, NRS 453.3335, 453.3345, 453.3351 or
6 subsection 1 of NRS 453.3353 or section 1 of this act must not be sentenced to an
7 additional term of imprisonment pursuant to any of the other listed sections even if
8 the person’s conduct satisfies the requirements for imposing an additional term of
9 imprisonment pursuant to another one or more of those sections.
10 2. A person who is sentenced to an alternative term of imprisonment pursuant
11 to subsection 3 of NRS 193.161, subsection 3 of NRS 193.1685 or subsection 2 of
12 NRS 453.3353 must not be sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment
13 pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 193.161, NRS 193.162, 193.163, 193.165,
14 193.166, 193.167, 193.1675, 193.1677, 193.1678, 193.168, 453.3335, 453.3345 or
15 453.3351 or section 1 of this act even if the person’s conduct satisfies the
16 requirements for imposing an additional term of imprisonment pursuant to another
17 one or more of those sections.
18 3. This section does not:
19 (a) Affect other penalties or limitations upon probation or suspension of a
20 sentence contained in the sections listed in subsection 1 or 2.
21 (b) Prohibit alleging in the alternative in the indictment or information that the
22 person’s conduct satisfies the requirements of more than one of the sections listed
23 in subsection 1 or 2 and introducing evidence to prove the alternative allegations.]
24 (Deleted by amendment.)
25 Sec. 3. [NRS 176.035 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 176.035 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, whenever a person
27 is convicted of two or more offenses, and sentence has been pronounced for one
28 offense, the court in imposing any subsequent sentence may provide that the
29 sentences subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively with
30 the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if
31 the court makes no order with reference thereto, all such subsequent sentences run
32 concurrently. For offenses committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes
33 the sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the minimum and
34 maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant to subsection 2, unless the
35 defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or
36 death.
37 2. When aggregating terms of imprisonment pursuant to subsection 1:
38 (a) If at least one sentence imposes a maximum term of imprisonment for life
39 with the possibility of parole, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of
40 imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term of imprisonment, and the
41 maximum aggregate term of imprisonment shall be deemed to be imprisonment in
42 the state prison for life with the possibility of parole.
43 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum term of
44 imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of imprisonment to
45 determine the minimum aggregate term of imprisonment and must aggregate the
46 maximum terms of imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
47 imprisonment.
48 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a person under
49 sentence of imprisonment for committing a felony commits another crime
50 constituting a felony and is sentenced to another term of imprisonment for that
51 felony, the latter term must not begin until the expiration of all prior terms,
52 including the expiration of any prior aggregated terms. If the person is a probationer
Senate Amendment No. 256 to Senate Bill No. 371 Page 6
1 at the time the subsequent felony is committed, the court may provide that the latter
2 term of imprisonment run concurrently with any prior terms or portions thereof.
3 4. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment commits another crime
4 constituting a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly
5 whether the sentence subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively
6 with the one first imposed.
7 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment commits another crime
8 for which the punishment is death or imprisonment for life without the possibility
9 of parole, the sentence must be executed without reference to the unexpired term of
10 imprisonment.
11 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of imprisonment, if the
12 person commits another crime for which the punishment is death or imprisonment
13 for life without the possibility of parole, the sentence must be executed without
14 reference to eligibility for parole.
15 7. If a court imposes an additional penalty pursuant to NRS 193.161 to
16 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, the sentence imposed for the
17 additional penalty must be aggregated with the sentence imposed for the underlying
18 offense. A prisoner upon whom a sentence for an additional penalty is imposed
19 pursuant to NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, before
20 October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for the additional penalty
21 aggregated with the sentence imposed for the underlying offense in accordance
22 with subsection 5 of NRS 213.1212.
23 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole Commissioners
24 from paroling a person under consecutive sentences of imprisonment from a current
25 term of imprisonment to a subsequent term of imprisonment.
26 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the aggregation of any
27 sentences of imprisonment relating to different cases.] (Deleted by amendment.)
28 Sec. 4. [NRS 463.151 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 463.151 1. The Legislature hereby declares that the exclusion or ejection of
30 certain persons from licensed gaming establishments which conduct pari-mutuel
31 wagering or operate any race book, sports pool or games, other than slot machines

33 effectively the strict regulation of licensed gaming.
34 2. The Commission may by regulation provide for the establishment of a list
35 of persons who are to be excluded or ejected from any licensed gaming
36 establishment which conducts pari-mutuel wagering or operates any race book,

38 person whose presence in the establishment is determined by the Board and the
39 Commission to pose a threat to the interests of this state or to licensed gaming, or
40 both.
41 3. In making that determination, the Board and the Commission may consider
42 any:

47 additional term of imprisonment was imposed pursuant to section 1 of this act;
48 (c) Violation or conspiracy to violate the provisions of this chapter relating to:

1 [(c)] (d) Notorious or unsavory reputation which would adversely affect public
2 confidence and trust that the gaming industry is free from criminal or corruptive
3 elements; or
4 [(d)] (e) Written order of a governmental agency which authorizes the
5 exclusion or ejection of the person from an establishment at which gaming or pari-
6 mutuel wagering is conducted.
7 4. Race, color, creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, or
8 gender identity or expression must not be grounds for placing the name of a person
9 upon the list.] (Deleted by amendment.)
10 Sec. 5. NRS 207.200 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 207.200 1. Unless a greater penalty is provided pursuant to NRS 200.603,
12 any person who, under circumstances not amounting to a burglary:

14 annoy the owner or occupant thereof, or to commit any unlawful act; or
15 (b) Willfully goes or remains upon any land or in any building after having
16 been warned during the previous [24] 36 months by the owner or occupant thereof

29 (II) Each corner of the land, upon or near the boundary; and
30 (2) Each side of all gates, cattle guards and openings that are designed to
31 allow human ingress to the area;

25 Sec. 3. [NRS 176.035 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 176.035 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, whenever a person
27 is convicted of two or more offenses, and sentence has been pronounced for one
28 offense, the court in imposing any subsequent sentence may provide that the
29 sentences subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively with
30 the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if
31 the court makes no order with reference thereto, all such subsequent sentences run
32 concurrently. For offenses committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes
33 the sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the minimum and
34 maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant to subsection 2, unless the
35 defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or
36 death.
37 2. When aggregating terms of imprisonment pursuant to subsection 1:
38 (a) If at least one sentence imposes a maximum term of imprisonment for life
39 with the possibility of parole, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of
40 imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term of imprisonment, and the
41 maximum aggregate term of imprisonment shall be deemed to be imprisonment in
42 the state prison for life with the possibility of parole.
43 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum term of
44 imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of imprisonment to
45 determine the minimum aggregate term of imprisonment and must aggregate the
46 maximum terms of imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
47 imprisonment.
48 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a person under
49 sentence of imprisonment for committing a felony commits another crime
50 constituting a felony and is sentenced to another term of imprisonment for that
51 felony, the latter term must not begin until the expiration of all prior terms,
52 including the expiration of any prior aggregated terms. If the person is a probationer

Senate Amendment No. 256 to Senate Bill No. 371 Page 6
1 at the time the subsequent felony is committed, the court may provide that the latter
2 term of imprisonment run concurrently with any prior terms or portions thereof.
3 4. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment commits another crime
4 constituting a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly
5 whether the sentence subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively
6 with the one first imposed.
7 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment commits another crime
8 for which the punishment is death or imprisonment for life without the possibility
9 of parole, the sentence must be executed without reference to the unexpired term of
10 imprisonment.
11 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of imprisonment, if the
12 person commits another crime for which the punishment is death or imprisonment
13 for life without the possibility of parole, the sentence must be executed without
14 reference to eligibility for parole.
15 7. If a court imposes an additional penalty pursuant to NRS 193.161 to
16 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, the sentence imposed for the
17 additional penalty must be aggregated with the sentence imposed for the underlying
18 offense. A prisoner upon whom a sentence for an additional penalty is imposed
19 pursuant to NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, before
20 October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for the additional penalty
21 aggregated with the sentence imposed for the underlying offense in accordance
22 with subsection 5 of NRS 213.1212.
23 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole Commissioners
24 from paroling a person under consecutive sentences of imprisonment from a current
25 term of imprisonment to a subsequent term of imprisonment.
26 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the aggregation of any
27 sentences of imprisonment relating to different cases.] (Deleted by amendment.)
28 Sec. 4. [NRS 463.151 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 463.151 1. The Legislature hereby declares that the exclusion or ejection of
30 certain persons from licensed gaming establishments which conduct pari-mutuel

38 person whose presence in the establishment is determined by the Board and the

2 confidence and trust that the gaming industry is free from criminal or corruptive
3 elements; or
4 [(d)] (e) Written order of a governmental agency which authorizes the
5 exclusion or ejection of the person from an establishment at which gaming or pari-
6 mutuel wagering is conducted.
7 4. Race, color, creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, or
8 gender identity or expression must not be grounds for placing the name of a person
9 upon the list.] (Deleted by amendment.)
10 Sec. 5. NRS 207.200 is hereby amended to read as follows:

29 (II) Each corner of the land, upon or near the boundary; and
