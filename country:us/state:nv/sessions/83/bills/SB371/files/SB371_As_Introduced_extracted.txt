Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; enhancing the criminal penalty for
certain crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel;
limiting the imposition of certain additional penalties
under certain circumstances; revising provisions relating
to aggregated sentences; revising provisions relating to
the exclusion or rejection of persons from certain licensed
gaming establishments; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who commits a crime under certain
2 specified circumstances may be subject to an additional penalty related to the
3 commission of the crime. (NRS 193.161-193.1685) Section 1 of this bill provides
4 that a person who commits a crime on the property of a resort hotel shall, in
5 addition to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute for the crime, be
6 punished by a term that is equal to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute
7 for the crime. Section 1 defines “resort hotel” as any building or group of buildings
8 that is maintained as and held out to the public to be a hotel where sleeping
9 accommodations are furnished to the transient public and that has: (1) more than
10 200 rooms available for sleeping accommodations; (2) at least one bar with seating
11 capacity for more than 30 patrons that serves alcoholic beverages sold by the drink
12 for consumption on the premises; (3) at least one restaurant with seating capacity of
13 more than 60 patrons that is open to the public 24 hours each day and 7 days each
14 week; and (4) a gaming area within the building or group of buildings.
15 Existing law provides that a person who has been sentenced to an additional
16 term of imprisonment under certain circumstances may not also be sentenced to
17 certain other additional terms of imprisonment. (NRS 193.169) Section 2 of this
18 bill provides that the additional penalty related to crimes committed on the property
19 of a resort hotel is also subject to this limitation.

– 2 –
20 Existing law provides that if a court imposes certain additional terms of
21 imprisonment, the sentence must be aggregated with the sentenced imposed for the
22 underlying offense. (NRS 176.035) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
23 additional penalty related to crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel is
24 subject to this requirement.
25 Existing law authorizes the Nevada Gaming Commission to establish a list of
26 persons who are required to be excluded or ejected from certain licensed gaming
27 establishments. Existing law authorizes the Commission and Nevada Gaming
28 Control Board to consider certain factors in determining whether to include a
29 person on the list. (NRS 463.151) In addition to the existing factors, section 4 of
30 this bill provides that the Commission and Board may also consider a second or
31 subsequent prior conviction of a crime for which the additional penalty related to
32 crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel was imposed by the court.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 193 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 193.169, any person
4 who commits a crime on the property of a resort hotel shall, in
5 addition to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute for the
6 crime, be punished:
7 (a) If the crime is a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, by
8 imprisonment in the county jail for a term equal to the term of
9 imprisonment prescribed by statute for the crime; and
10 (b) If the crime is a felony, by imprisonment in the state prison
11 for a term equal to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute
12 for the crime.
13 2. In determining the length of the additional penalty
14 imposed pursuant to this section, the court shall consider the
15 following information:

18 (c) The impact of the crime on any victim;
19 (d) Any mitigating factors presented by the person; and

22 information described in paragraphs (a) to (e), inclusive, in
23 determining the length of the additional penalty imposed.

25 (a) Must not exceed the sentence imposed for the crime; and

14 Sec. 2. NRS 193.169 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 193.169 1. A person who is sentenced to an additional term
16 of imprisonment pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS
17 193.161, NRS 193.162, 193.163, 193.165, 193.166, 193.167,
18 193.1675, 193.1677, 193.1678, 193.168, subsection 1 of NRS
19 193.1685, NRS 453.3335, 453.3345, 453.3351 or subsection 1 of
20 NRS 453.3353 or section 1 of this act must not be sentenced to an
21 additional term of imprisonment pursuant to any of the other listed
22 sections even if the person’s conduct satisfies the requirements for
23 imposing an additional term of imprisonment pursuant to another
24 one or more of those sections.
25 2. A person who is sentenced to an alternative term of
26 imprisonment pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 193.161, subsection
27 3 of NRS 193.1685 or subsection 2 of NRS 453.3353 must not be
28 sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment pursuant to
29 subsection 1 of NRS 193.161, NRS 193.162, 193.163, 193.165,
30 193.166, 193.167, 193.1675, 193.1677, 193.1678, 193.168,
31 453.3335, 453.3345 or 453.3351 or section 1 of this act even if the
32 person’s conduct satisfies the requirements for imposing an
33 additional term of imprisonment pursuant to another one or more of
34 those sections.
35 3. This section does not:
36 (a) Affect other penalties or limitations upon probation or
37 suspension of a sentence contained in the sections listed in
38 subsection 1 or 2.
39 (b) Prohibit alleging in the alternative in the indictment or
40 information that the person’s conduct satisfies the requirements of
41 more than one of the sections listed in subsection 1 or 2 and
42 introducing evidence to prove the alternative allegations.
43 Sec. 3. NRS 176.035 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 176.035 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3,
45 whenever a person is convicted of two or more offenses, and
-
*SB371*
– 4 –
1 sentence has been pronounced for one offense, the court in imposing
2 any subsequent sentence may provide that the sentences
3 subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively
4 with the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in
5 subsections 3 and 4, if the court makes no order with reference
6 thereto, all such subsequent sentences run concurrently. For offenses
7 committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes the
8 sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the
9 minimum and maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant
10 to subsection 2, unless the defendant is sentenced to life
11 imprisonment without the possibility of parole or death.
12 2. When aggregating terms of imprisonment pursuant to
13 subsection 1:
14 (a) If at least one sentence imposes a maximum term of
15 imprisonment for life with the possibility of parole, the court must
16 aggregate the minimum terms of imprisonment to determine the
17 minimum aggregate term of imprisonment, and the maximum
18 aggregate term of imprisonment shall be deemed to be
19 imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of
20 parole.
21 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum term
22 of imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of
23 imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term of
24 imprisonment and must aggregate the maximum terms
25 of imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
26 imprisonment.
27 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a
28 person under sentence of imprisonment for committing a felony
29 commits another crime constituting a felony and is sentenced to
30 another term of imprisonment for that felony, the latter term must
31 not begin until the expiration of all prior terms, including the
32 expiration of any prior aggregated terms. If the person is a
33 probationer at the time the subsequent felony is committed, the court
34 may provide that the latter term of imprisonment run concurrently
35 with any prior terms or portions thereof.
36 4. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment
37 commits another crime constituting a misdemeanor or gross
38 misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly whether the sentence
39 subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively with
40 the one first imposed.
41 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment
42 commits another crime for which the punishment is death or
43 imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, the sentence
44 must be executed without reference to the unexpired term of
45 imprisonment.
-
*SB371*
– 5 –
1 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of
2 imprisonment, if the person commits another crime for which the
3 punishment is death or imprisonment for life without the possibility
4 of parole, the sentence must be executed without reference to
5 eligibility for parole.
6 7. If a court imposes an additional penalty pursuant to NRS
7 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, the
8 sentence imposed for the additional penalty must be aggregated with
9 the sentence imposed for the underlying offense. A prisoner upon
10 whom a sentence for an additional penalty is imposed pursuant to
11 NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act,
12 before October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for
13 the additional penalty aggregated with the sentence imposed for the
14 underlying offense in accordance with subsection 5 of
15 NRS 213.1212.
16 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole
17 Commissioners from paroling a person under consecutive sentences
18 of imprisonment from a current term of imprisonment to a
19 subsequent term of imprisonment.
20 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the
21 aggregation of any sentences of imprisonment relating to different
22 cases.
23 Sec. 4. NRS 463.151 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 463.151 1. The Legislature hereby declares that the exclusion
25 or ejection of certain persons from licensed gaming establishments
26 which conduct pari-mutuel wagering or operate any race book,
27 sports pool or games, other than slot machines only, is necessary to
28 effectuate the policies of this chapter and to maintain effectively the
29 strict regulation of licensed gaming.
30 2. The Commission may by regulation provide for the
31 establishment of a list of persons who are to be excluded or ejected
32 from any licensed gaming establishment which conducts pari-
33 mutuel wagering or operates any race book, sports pool or games,
34 other than slot machines only. The list may include any person
35 whose presence in the establishment is determined by the Board and
36 the Commission to pose a threat to the interests of this state or to
37 licensed gaming, or both.
38 3. In making that determination, the Board and the
39 Commission may consider any:
40 (a) Prior conviction of a crime which is a felony in this state or
41 under the laws of the United States, a crime involving moral
42 turpitude or a violation of the gaming laws of any state;
43 (b) A second or subsequent prior conviction of a crime for
44 which an additional term of imprisonment was imposed pursuant
45 to section 1 of this act;
-
*SB371*
– 6 –
1 (c) Violation or conspiracy to violate the provisions of this
2 chapter relating to:
3 (1) The failure to disclose an interest in a gaming
4 establishment for which the person must obtain a license; or
5 (2) Willful evasion of fees or taxes;
6 [(c)] (d) Notorious or unsavory reputation which would
7 adversely affect public confidence and trust that the gaming industry
8 is free from criminal or corruptive elements; or
9 [(d)] (e) Written order of a governmental agency which
10 authorizes the exclusion or ejection of the person from an
11 establishment at which gaming or pari-mutuel wagering is
12 conducted.
13 4. Race, color, creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, sexual
14 orientation, or gender identity or expression must not be grounds for
15 placing the name of a person upon the list.

____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to crimes. (BDR 15-908)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; enhancing the criminal penalty for
certain crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel;
limiting the imposition of certain additional penalties
under certain circumstances; revising provisions relating
to aggregated sentences; revising provisions relating to
the exclusion or rejection of persons from certain licensed

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who commits a crime under certain
2 specified circumstances may be subject to an additional penalty related to the
3 commission of the crime. (NRS 193.161-193.1685) Section 1 of this bill provides
4 that a person who commits a crime on the property of a resort hotel shall, in
5 addition to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute for the crime, be
6 punished by a term that is equal to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute
7 for the crime. Section 1 defines “resort hotel” as any building or group of buildings
8 that is maintained as and held out to the public to be a hotel where sleeping
9 accommodations are furnished to the transient public and that has: (1) more than
10 200 rooms available for sleeping accommodations; (2) at least one bar with seating
11 capacity for more than 30 patrons that serves alcoholic beverages sold by the drink
12 for consumption on the premises; (3) at least one restaurant with seating capacity of
13 more than 60 patrons that is open to the public 24 hours each day and 7 days each
14 week; and (4) a gaming area within the building or group of buildings.
15 Existing law provides that a person who has been sentenced to an additional
16 term of imprisonment under certain circumstances may not also be sentenced to
17 certain other additional terms of imprisonment. (NRS 193.169) Section 2 of this
18 bill provides that the additional penalty related to crimes committed on the property
19 of a resort hotel is also subject to this limitation.
-
*SB371*

– 2 –
20 Existing law provides that if a court imposes certain additional terms of
21 imprisonment, the sentence must be aggregated with the sentenced imposed for the
22 underlying offense. (NRS 176.035) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
23 additional penalty related to crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel is
24 subject to this requirement.
25 Existing law authorizes the Nevada Gaming Commission to establish a list of
26 persons who are required to be excluded or ejected from certain licensed gaming
27 establishments. Existing law authorizes the Commission and Nevada Gaming
28 Control Board to consider certain factors in determining whether to include a
29 person on the list. (NRS 463.151) In addition to the existing factors, section 4 of
30 this bill provides that the Commission and Board may also consider a second or
31 subsequent prior conviction of a crime for which the additional penalty related to
32 crimes committed on the property of a resort hotel was imposed by the court.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

11 for a term equal to the term of imprisonment prescribed by statute
12 for the crime.

17 193.161, NRS 193.162, 193.163, 193.165, 193.166, 193.167,
18 193.1675, 193.1677, 193.1678, 193.168, subsection 1 of NRS
19 193.1685, NRS 453.3335, 453.3345, 453.3351 or subsection 1 of
20 NRS 453.3353 or section 1 of this act must not be sentenced to an
21 additional term of imprisonment pursuant to any of the other listed
22 sections even if the person’s conduct satisfies the requirements for
23 imposing an additional term of imprisonment pursuant to another
24 one or more of those sections.
25 2. A person who is sentenced to an alternative term of
26 imprisonment pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 193.161, subsection
27 3 of NRS 193.1685 or subsection 2 of NRS 453.3353 must not be
28 sentenced to an additional term of imprisonment pursuant to
29 subsection 1 of NRS 193.161, NRS 193.162, 193.163, 193.165,
30 193.166, 193.167, 193.1675, 193.1677, 193.1678, 193.168,
31 453.3335, 453.3345 or 453.3351 or section 1 of this act even if the

35 3. This section does not:
36 (a) Affect other penalties or limitations upon probation or
37 suspension of a sentence contained in the sections listed in
38 subsection 1 or 2.
39 (b) Prohibit alleging in the alternative in the indictment or
40 information that the person’s conduct satisfies the requirements of
41 more than one of the sections listed in subsection 1 or 2 and
42 introducing evidence to prove the alternative allegations.
43 Sec. 3. NRS 176.035 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 176.035 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3,
45 whenever a person is convicted of two or more offenses, and
-
*SB371*

– 4 –
1 sentence has been pronounced for one offense, the court in imposing
2 any subsequent sentence may provide that the sentences
3 subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively
4 with the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in
5 subsections 3 and 4, if the court makes no order with reference
6 thereto, all such subsequent sentences run concurrently. For offenses
7 committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes the
8 sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the
9 minimum and maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant
10 to subsection 2, unless the defendant is sentenced to life
11 imprisonment without the possibility of parole or death.
12 2. When aggregating terms of imprisonment pursuant to
13 subsection 1:
14 (a) If at least one sentence imposes a maximum term of
15 imprisonment for life with the possibility of parole, the court must
16 aggregate the minimum terms of imprisonment to determine the
17 minimum aggregate term of imprisonment, and the maximum
18 aggregate term of imprisonment shall be deemed to be
19 imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of
20 parole.
21 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum term
22 of imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of
23 imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term of
24 imprisonment and must aggregate the maximum terms
25 of imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
26 imprisonment.
27 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever a
28 person under sentence of imprisonment for committing a felony
29 commits another crime constituting a felony and is sentenced to
30 another term of imprisonment for that felony, the latter term must
31 not begin until the expiration of all prior terms, including the
32 expiration of any prior aggregated terms. If the person is a
33 probationer at the time the subsequent felony is committed, the court
34 may provide that the latter term of imprisonment run concurrently
35 with any prior terms or portions thereof.
36 4. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment
37 commits another crime constituting a misdemeanor or gross
38 misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly whether the sentence
39 subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively with
40 the one first imposed.
41 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment

1 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of
2 imprisonment, if the person commits another crime for which the
3 punishment is death or imprisonment for life without the possibility
4 of parole, the sentence must be executed without reference to
5 eligibility for parole.
6 7. If a court imposes an additional penalty pursuant to NRS
7 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, the
8 sentence imposed for the additional penalty must be aggregated with
9 the sentence imposed for the underlying offense. A prisoner upon
10 whom a sentence for an additional penalty is imposed pursuant to
11 NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act,
12 before October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for
13 the additional penalty aggregated with the sentence imposed for the
14 underlying offense in accordance with subsection 5 of
15 NRS 213.1212.
16 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole
17 Commissioners from paroling a person under consecutive sentences
18 of imprisonment from a current term of imprisonment to a
19 subsequent term of imprisonment.
20 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the
21 aggregation of any sentences of imprisonment relating to different
22 cases.
23 Sec. 4. NRS 463.151 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 463.151 1. The Legislature hereby declares that the exclusion
25 or ejection of certain persons from licensed gaming establishments
26 which conduct pari-mutuel wagering or operate any race book,
27 sports pool or games, other than slot machines only, is necessary to
28 effectuate the policies of this chapter and to maintain effectively the
29 strict regulation of licensed gaming.
30 2. The Commission may by regulation provide for the
31 establishment of a list of persons who are to be excluded or ejected
32 from any licensed gaming establishment which conducts pari-
33 mutuel wagering or operates any race book, sports pool or games,
34 other than slot machines only. The list may include any person
35 whose presence in the establishment is determined by the Board and
36 the Commission to pose a threat to the interests of this state or to
37 licensed gaming, or both.
38 3. In making that determination, the Board and the
39 Commission may consider any:
40 (a) Prior conviction of a crime which is a felony in this state or
41 under the laws of the United States, a crime involving moral
42 turpitude or a violation of the gaming laws of any state;
43 (b) A second or subsequent prior conviction of a crime for
44 which an additional term of imprisonment was imposed pursuant
45 to section 1 of this act;

6 [(c)] (d) Notorious or unsavory reputation which would
7 adversely affect public confidence and trust that the gaming industry
8 is free from criminal or corruptive elements; or
9 [(d)] (e) Written order of a governmental agency which
10 authorizes the exclusion or ejection of the person from an
11 establishment at which gaming or pari-mutuel wagering is
12 conducted.

14 orientation, or gender identity or expression must not be grounds for
15 placing the name of a person upon the list.
