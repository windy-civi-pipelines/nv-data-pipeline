CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing separate provisions for
the licensing or certification, regulation and discipline of
agencies to provide personal care services in the home,
employment agencies that contract to provide certain
nonmedical services and intermediary service organizations;
enacting provisions to facilitate the collecting of certain debts
from applicants for certain licenses; imposing certain
requirements as an applicant for a certificate to operate an
intermediary service organization; revising the training
requirements for certain caregivers who receive
reimbursement through Medicaid; authorizing a family

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various types of
medical facilities and facilities for the dependent by the Division of Public and
Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449
of NRS) Existing law requires an agency to provide personal care services in the
home to be licensed by the Division as a facility for the dependent. (NRS 449.0045,
449.030) Existing law requires an employment agency that contracts with persons
in this State to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly
persons or persons with disabilities in the home to obtain a license from the State
Board of Health. (NRS 449.03005) Existing law requires an intermediary service
organization to obtain a certificate from the Division. (NRS 449.431) Existing law
requires the Board to adopt regulations governing agencies to provide personal care
services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical
services related to personal care to elderly persons and persons with disabilities and
intermediary service organizations. (NRS 449.03005, 449.0302, 449.4309)
This bill transfers the provisions of law governing agencies to provide personal
care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide
nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with
disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations from the chapter of
the Nevada Revised Statutes that generally governs medical facilities and facilities
for the dependent to a new chapter in the Nevada Revised Statutes without
changing the current substantive provisions that govern such agencies and
organizations. Sections 2-19, 24-49, 51-60, 69-79 and 81-90 of this bill create a
new chapter consisting of provisions for the licensure and regulation of such
entities in a manner substantially identical to the manner in which those entities are
licensed and regulated under existing law. Sections 94, 96-104 and 150 of this bill
eliminate provisions governing those entities from the chapter of the Nevada
Revised Statutes that regulates medical facilities and facilities for the dependent.
Sections 93, 111, 113, 117, 118, 120-123, 126-133, 138 and 146 of this bill
eliminate references to sections repealed by section 150. Sections 91, 92, 95 and
105-146 of this bill make various conforming changes so that the legal status of
-

– 2 –
agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations is
not changed by this bill.
Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
obligations, including by requiring an applicant for such a license to provide his or
her social security number. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 20, 21 and 50 of this bill
enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a
license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the home or an
employment agency that contracts to provide nonmedical services related to
personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home in order to
comply with federal law. Section 23 of this bill establishes alternate provisions for
such an applicant who does not have a social security number. Section 22 of this
bill also requires an applicant for the renewal of such a license to provide certain
information for the purpose of identifying persons who owe certain debts to the
State. Sections 65, 69, 74 and 76 of this bill establish similar provisions for
intermediary service organizations, which were carried over from existing law.
(NRS 449.4312, 449.4313, 449.4315, 449.432, 449.4322)
Existing law requires: (1) an agency to provide personal care services in the
home to file with the Administrator of the Division a surety bond or a substitute for
a surety bond; and (2) an applicant for a license to operate an agency to provide
personal care services in the home to undergo a criminal background check. (NRS
449.065, 449.067, 449.122) Sections 67, 68 and 80 of this bill impose similar
requirements on intermediary service organizations.
Existing law requires: (1) the Department to apply for a home and community-
based services waiver to include structured family caregiving for certain persons as
medical assistance under Medicaid; and (2) a caregiver providing care under that
waiver to complete training required by the Aging and Disability Services Division
of the Department. (NRS 422.3965) Sections 30 and 122 of this bill instead require
such a caregiver to complete the same training that is required for unlicensed
caregivers who provide care for an agency to provide personal care services in the
home.
Existing law requires the Director of the Department to include in the State
Plan for Medicaid authorization for a recipient of Medicaid to be deemed a provider
of services for the purposes of allowing the recipient to receive reimbursement for
personal care services covered by Medicaid and using that money to pay for
services provided by a personal care assistant or an agency to provide personal care
services in the home. (NRS 422.272407) Section 120 of this bill authorizes a
family member of a recipient of Medicaid to serve as a personal care assistant for a
recipient of Medicaid if the family member: (1) completes the training required by
section 30 for certain other caregivers; and (2) receives authorization from a
provider of health care.
Section 147 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to move regulations
specifically relating to such entities to a new chapter of the Nevada Administrative
Code that corresponds to the new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes created
by sections 2-90. Section 147 also: (1) requires the Board to adopt new regulations
to replace other regulations relating to those entities that remain in the chapter of
the Nevada Administrative Code governing medical facilities and facilities for the
dependent; and (2) provides that those existing regulations remain in effect until the
Board adopts new regulations to replace them. Section 148 of this bill clarifies that
this bill does not affect the validity of: (1) licenses or certificates to operate
agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
-

contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations;

entities; or (3) disciplinary actions taken against such entities.
