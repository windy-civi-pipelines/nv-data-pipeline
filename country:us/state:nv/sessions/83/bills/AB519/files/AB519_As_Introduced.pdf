AN ACT relating to health care; establishing separate provisions for

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various types of
2 medical facilities and facilities for the dependent by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449
4 of NRS) Existing law requires an agency to provide personal care services in the
5 home to be licensed by the Division as a facility for the dependent. (NRS 449.0045,
6 449.030) Existing law requires an employment agency that contracts with persons
7 in this State to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly
8 persons or persons with disabilities in the home to obtain a license from the State
9 Board of Health. (NRS 449.03005) Existing law requires an intermediary service
10 organization to obtain a certificate from the Division. (NRS 449.431) Existing law
11 requires the Board to adopt regulations governing agencies to provide personal care
12 services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical
-

– 2 –
13 services related to personal care to elderly persons and persons with disabilities and
14 intermediary service organizations. (NRS 449.03005, 449.0302, 449.4309)
15 This bill transfers the provisions of law governing agencies to provide personal
16 care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide
17 nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with
18 disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations from the chapter of
19 the Nevada Revised Statutes that generally governs medical facilities and facilities
20 for the dependent to a new chapter in the Nevada Revised Statutes without
21 changing the current substantive provisions that govern such agencies and
22 organizations. Sections 2-19, 24-49, 51-60, 69-79 and 81-90 of this bill create a
23 new chapter consisting of provisions for the licensure and regulation of such
24 entities in a manner identical to the manner in which those entities are licensed and
25 regulated under existing law. Sections 94, 96-104 and 150 of this bill eliminate
26 provisions governing those entities from the chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes
27 that regulates medical facilities and facilities for the dependent. Sections 93, 111,
28 113, 117, 118, 120-123, 126-133, 138 and 146 of this bill eliminate references to
29 sections repealed by section 150. Sections 91, 92, 95 and 105-146 of this bill make
30 various conforming changes so that the legal status of agencies to provide personal
31 care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide
32 nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with
33 disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations is not changed by
34 this bill.
35 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
36 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
37 obligations, including by requiring an applicant for such a license to provide his or
38 her social security number. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 20, 21 and 50 of this bill
39 enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a
40 license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the home or an
41 employment agency that contracts to provide nonmedical services related to
42 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home in order to
43 comply with federal law. Section 23 of this bill establishes alternate provisions for
44 such an applicant who does not have a social security number. Section 22 of this
45 bill also requires an applicant for the renewal of such a license to provide certain
46 information for the purpose of identifying persons who owe certain debts to the
47 State. Sections 65, 69, 74 and 76 of this bill establish similar provisions for
48 intermediary service organizations, which were carried over from existing law.
49 (NRS 449.4312, 449.4313, 449.4315, 449.432, 449.4322)
50 Existing law requires: (1) an agency to provide personal care services in the
51 home to file with the Administrator of the Division a surety bond or a substitute for
52 a surety bond; and (2) an applicant for a license to operate an agency to provide
53 personal care services in the home to undergo a criminal background check. (NRS
54 449.065, 449.067, 449.122) Sections 67, 68 and 80 of this bill impose similar
55 requirements on intermediary service organizations.
56 Section 147 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to move regulations
57 specifically relating to such entities to a new chapter of the Nevada Administrative
58 Code that corresponds to the new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes created
59 by sections 2-90. Section 147 also: (1) requires the Board to adopt new regulations
60 to replace other regulations relating to those entities that remain in the chapter of
61 the Nevada Administrative Code governing medical facilities and facilities for the
62 dependent; and (2) provides that those existing regulations remain in effect until the
63 Board adopts new regulations to replace them. Section 148 of this bill clarifies that
64 this bill does not affect the validity of: (1) licenses or certificates to operate
65 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
66 contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
67 or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations;
-

– 3 –
68 (2) certain training completed by the operators, employees and contractors of such
69 entities; or (3) disciplinary actions taken against such entities.
