EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing separate provisions for the licensing
or certification, regulation and discipline of agencies to provide
personal care services in the home, employment agencies that contract
to provide certain nonmedical services and intermediary service
organizations; enacting provisions to facilitate the collecting of certain
debts from applicants for certain licenses; imposing certain
requirements as an applicant for a certificate to operate an intermediary
service organization; revising the training requirements for certain
caregivers who receive reimbursement through Medicaid;
authorizing a family member to serve as the personal care
assistant for a recipient of Medicaid under certain circumstances;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various types of medical
2 facilities and facilities for the dependent by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
3 the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS) Existing law requires
4 an agency to provide personal care services in the home to be licensed by the Division as a
5 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449.0045, 449.030) Existing law requires an employment
6 agency that contracts with persons in this State to provide nonmedical services related to
7 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home to obtain a license
8 from the State Board of Health. (NRS 449.03005) Existing law requires an intermediary
9 service organization to obtain a certificate from the Division. (NRS 449.431) Existing law
10 requires the Board to adopt regulations governing agencies to provide personal care services
11 in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical services related to
12 personal care to elderly persons and persons with disabilities and intermediary service
13 organizations. (NRS 449.03005, 449.0302, 449.4309)
14 This bill transfers the provisions of law governing agencies to provide personal care
15 services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical services
16 related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home and
Assembly Amendment No. 451 to Assembly Bill No. 519 Page 4
17 intermediary service organizations from the chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes that
18 generally governs medical facilities and facilities for the dependent to a new chapter in the
19 Nevada Revised Statutes without changing the current substantive provisions that govern such
20 agencies and organizations. Sections 2-19, 24-49, 51-60, 69-79 and 81-90 of this bill create a
21 new chapter consisting of provisions for the licensure and regulation of such entities in a
22 manner substantially identical to the manner in which those entities are licensed and
23 regulated under existing law. Sections 94, 96-104 and 150 of this bill eliminate provisions
24 governing those entities from the chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes that regulates
25 medical facilities and facilities for the dependent. Sections 93, 111, 113, 117, 118, 120-123,
26 126-133, 138 and 146 of this bill eliminate references to sections repealed by section 150.
27 Sections 91, 92, 95 and 105-146 of this bill make various conforming changes so that the
28 legal status of agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies
29 that contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or
30 persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations is not changed by
31 this bill.
32 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that applicants for
33 certain licenses and certificates comply with child support obligations, including by requiring
34 an applicant for such a license to provide his or her social security number. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
35 Sections 20, 21 and 50 of this bill enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for the
36 issuance or renewal of a license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the
37 home or an employment agency that contracts to provide nonmedical services related to
38 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home in order to comply
39 with federal law. Section 23 of this bill establishes alternate provisions for such an applicant
40 who does not have a social security number. Section 22 of this bill also requires an applicant
41 for the renewal of such a license to provide certain information for the purpose of identifying
42 persons who owe certain debts to the State. Sections 65, 69, 74 and 76 of this bill establish
43 similar provisions for intermediary service organizations, which were carried over from
44 existing law. (NRS 449.4312, 449.4313, 449.4315, 449.432, 449.4322)
45 Existing law requires: (1) an agency to provide personal care services in the home to file
46 with the Administrator of the Division a surety bond or a substitute for a surety bond; and (2)
47 an applicant for a license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the home to
48 undergo a criminal background check. (NRS 449.065, 449.067, 449.122) Sections 67, 68 and
49 80 of this bill impose similar requirements on intermediary service organizations.
50 Existing law requires: (1) the Department to apply for a home and community-
51 based services waiver to include structured family caregiving for certain persons as
52 medical assistance under Medicaid; and (2) a caregiver providing care under that waiver
53 to complete training required by the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
54 Department. (NRS 422.3965) Sections 30 and 122 of this bill instead require such a
55 caregiver to complete the same training that is required for unlicensed caregivers who
56 provide care for an agency to provide personal care services in the home.
57 Existing law requires the Director of the Department to include in the State Plan for
58 Medicaid authorization for a recipient of Medicaid to be deemed a provider of services
59 for the purposes of allowing the recipient to receive reimbursement for personal care
60 services covered by Medicaid and using that money to pay for services provided by a
61 personal care assistant or an agency to provide personal care services in the home. (NRS
62 422.272407). Section 120 of this bill authorizes a family member of a recipient of
63 Medicaid to serve as a personal care assistant for a recipient of Medicaid if the family
64 member: (1) completes the training required by section 30 for certain other caregivers;
65 and (2) receives authorization from a provider of health care.
66 Section 147 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to move regulations specifically
67 relating to such entities to a new chapter of the Nevada Administrative Code that corresponds
68 to the new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes created by sections 2-90. Section 147 also:
69 (1) requires the Board to adopt new regulations to replace other regulations relating to those
70 entities that remain in the chapter of the Nevada Administrative Code governing medical
71 facilities and facilities for the dependent; and (2) provides that those existing regulations
72 remain in effect until the Board adopts new regulations to replace them. Section 148 of this
73 bill clarifies that this bill does not affect the validity of: (1) licenses or certificates to operate
74 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to
75 provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with
Assembly Amendment No. 451 to Assembly Bill No. 519 Page 5
76 disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations; (2) certain training completed
77 by the operators, employees and contractors of such entities; or (3) disciplinary actions taken
78 against such entities.

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Creates a separate chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes governing
certain agencies and organizations that provide nonmedical
services. (BDR 40-805)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing separate provisions for the licensing
or certification, regulation and discipline of agencies to provide
personal care services in the home, employment agencies that contract
to provide certain nonmedical services and intermediary service
organizations; enacting provisions to facilitate the collecting of certain
debts from applicants for certain licenses; imposing certain
requirements as an applicant for a certificate to operate an intermediary
service organization; revising the training requirements for certain
caregivers who receive reimbursement through Medicaid;
authorizing a family member to serve as the personal care
assistant for a recipient of Medicaid under certain circumstances;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various types of medical
2 facilities and facilities for the dependent by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
3 the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS) Existing law requires
4 an agency to provide personal care services in the home to be licensed by the Division as a
5 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449.0045, 449.030) Existing law requires an employment
6 agency that contracts with persons in this State to provide nonmedical services related to
7 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home to obtain a license
8 from the State Board of Health. (NRS 449.03005) Existing law requires an intermediary
9 service organization to obtain a certificate from the Division. (NRS 449.431) Existing law
10 requires the Board to adopt regulations governing agencies to provide personal care services
11 in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical services related to
12 personal care to elderly persons and persons with disabilities and intermediary service
13 organizations. (NRS 449.03005, 449.0302, 449.4309)
14 This bill transfers the provisions of law governing agencies to provide personal care
15 services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical services
16 related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home and

Assembly Amendment No. 451 to Assembly Bill No. 519 Page 4
17 intermediary service organizations from the chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes that
18 generally governs medical facilities and facilities for the dependent to a new chapter in the
19 Nevada Revised Statutes without changing the current substantive provisions that govern such
20 agencies and organizations. Sections 2-19, 24-49, 51-60, 69-79 and 81-90 of this bill create a
21 new chapter consisting of provisions for the licensure and regulation of such entities in a
22 manner substantially identical to the manner in which those entities are licensed and
23 regulated under existing law. Sections 94, 96-104 and 150 of this bill eliminate provisions
24 governing those entities from the chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes that regulates
25 medical facilities and facilities for the dependent. Sections 93, 111, 113, 117, 118, 120-123,
26 126-133, 138 and 146 of this bill eliminate references to sections repealed by section 150.
27 Sections 91, 92, 95 and 105-146 of this bill make various conforming changes so that the
28 legal status of agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies
29 that contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or
30 persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations is not changed by
31 this bill.
32 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that applicants for
33 certain licenses and certificates comply with child support obligations, including by requiring
34 an applicant for such a license to provide his or her social security number. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
35 Sections 20, 21 and 50 of this bill enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for the
36 issuance or renewal of a license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the
37 home or an employment agency that contracts to provide nonmedical services related to
38 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home in order to comply
39 with federal law. Section 23 of this bill establishes alternate provisions for such an applicant
40 who does not have a social security number. Section 22 of this bill also requires an applicant
41 for the renewal of such a license to provide certain information for the purpose of identifying
42 persons who owe certain debts to the State. Sections 65, 69, 74 and 76 of this bill establish
43 similar provisions for intermediary service organizations, which were carried over from
44 existing law. (NRS 449.4312, 449.4313, 449.4315, 449.432, 449.4322)
45 Existing law requires: (1) an agency to provide personal care services in the home to file
46 with the Administrator of the Division a surety bond or a substitute for a surety bond; and (2)
47 an applicant for a license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the home to
48 undergo a criminal background check. (NRS 449.065, 449.067, 449.122) Sections 67, 68 and
49 80 of this bill impose similar requirements on intermediary service organizations.
50 Existing law requires: (1) the Department to apply for a home and community-
51 based services waiver to include structured family caregiving for certain persons as
52 medical assistance under Medicaid; and (2) a caregiver providing care under that waiver
53 to complete training required by the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
54 Department. (NRS 422.3965) Sections 30 and 122 of this bill instead require such a
55 caregiver to complete the same training that is required for unlicensed caregivers who
56 provide care for an agency to provide personal care services in the home.
57 Existing law requires the Director of the Department to include in the State Plan for
58 Medicaid authorization for a recipient of Medicaid to be deemed a provider of services
59 for the purposes of allowing the recipient to receive reimbursement for personal care
60 services covered by Medicaid and using that money to pay for services provided by a
61 personal care assistant or an agency to provide personal care services in the home. (NRS
62 422.272407). Section 120 of this bill authorizes a family member of a recipient of
63 Medicaid to serve as a personal care assistant for a recipient of Medicaid if the family
64 member: (1) completes the training required by section 30 for certain other caregivers;
65 and (2) receives authorization from a provider of health care.
66 Section 147 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to move regulations specifically
67 relating to such entities to a new chapter of the Nevada Administrative Code that corresponds
68 to the new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes created by sections 2-90. Section 147 also:
69 (1) requires the Board to adopt new regulations to replace other regulations relating to those
70 entities that remain in the chapter of the Nevada Administrative Code governing medical
71 facilities and facilities for the dependent; and (2) provides that those existing regulations
72 remain in effect until the Board adopts new regulations to replace them. Section 148 of this
73 bill clarifies that this bill does not affect the validity of: (1) licenses or certificates to operate
74 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to
75 provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with

Assembly Amendment No. 451 to Assembly Bill No. 519 Page 5
76 disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations; (2) certain training completed
77 by the operators, employees and contractors of such entities; or (3) disciplinary actions taken
78 against such entities.

14 successful bidder, whoever recorded the trustee’s deed upon sale pursuant to
15 subsection 10, shall cause a copy of the trustee’s deed upon sale to be posted

20 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 10, the successful bidder:

41 recorder. The county treasurer shall remit quarterly to the organization operating
