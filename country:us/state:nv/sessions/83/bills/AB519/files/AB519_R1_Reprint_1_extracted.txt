AN ACT relating to health care; establishing separate provisions for
the licensing or certification, regulation and discipline of
agencies to provide personal care services in the home,
employment agencies that contract to provide certain
nonmedical services and intermediary service
organizations; enacting provisions to facilitate the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various types of
2 medical facilities and facilities for the dependent by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449
4 of NRS) Existing law requires an agency to provide personal care services in the
5 home to be licensed by the Division as a facility for the dependent. (NRS 449.0045,
6 449.030) Existing law requires an employment agency that contracts with persons
7 in this State to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly
8 persons or persons with disabilities in the home to obtain a license from the State
-
*AB519_R1*
– 2 –
9 Board of Health. (NRS 449.03005) Existing law requires an intermediary service
10 organization to obtain a certificate from the Division. (NRS 449.431) Existing law
11 requires the Board to adopt regulations governing agencies to provide personal care
12 services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical
13 services related to personal care to elderly persons and persons with disabilities and
14 intermediary service organizations. (NRS 449.03005, 449.0302, 449.4309)
15 This bill transfers the provisions of law governing agencies to provide personal
16 care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide
17 nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with
18 disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations from the chapter of
19 the Nevada Revised Statutes that generally governs medical facilities and facilities
20 for the dependent to a new chapter in the Nevada Revised Statutes without
21 changing the current substantive provisions that govern such agencies and
22 organizations. Sections 2-19, 24-49, 51-60, 69-79 and 81-90 of this bill create a
23 new chapter consisting of provisions for the licensure and regulation of such
24 entities in a manner substantially identical to the manner in which those entities are
25 licensed and regulated under existing law. Sections 94, 96-104 and 150 of this bill
26 eliminate provisions governing those entities from the chapter of the Nevada
27 Revised Statutes that regulates medical facilities and facilities for the dependent.
28 Sections 93, 111, 113, 117, 118, 120-123, 126-133, 138 and 146 of this bill
29 eliminate references to sections repealed by section 150. Sections 91, 92, 95 and
30 105-146 of this bill make various conforming changes so that the legal status of
31 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
32 contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
33 or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations is
34 not changed by this bill.
35 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
36 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
37 obligations, including by requiring an applicant for such a license to provide his or
38 her social security number. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 20, 21 and 50 of this bill
39 enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a
40 license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the home or an
41 employment agency that contracts to provide nonmedical services related to
42 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home in order to
43 comply with federal law. Section 23 of this bill establishes alternate provisions for
44 such an applicant who does not have a social security number. Section 22 of this
45 bill also requires an applicant for the renewal of such a license to provide certain
46 information for the purpose of identifying persons who owe certain debts to the
47 State. Sections 65, 69, 74 and 76 of this bill establish similar provisions for
48 intermediary service organizations, which were carried over from existing law.
49 (NRS 449.4312, 449.4313, 449.4315, 449.432, 449.4322)
50 Existing law requires: (1) an agency to provide personal care services in the
51 home to file with the Administrator of the Division a surety bond or a substitute for
52 a surety bond; and (2) an applicant for a license to operate an agency to provide
53 personal care services in the home to undergo a criminal background check. (NRS
54 449.065, 449.067, 449.122) Sections 67, 68 and 80 of this bill impose similar
55 requirements on intermediary service organizations.
56 Existing law requires: (1) the Department to apply for a home and community-
57 based services waiver to include structured family caregiving for certain persons as
58 medical assistance under Medicaid; and (2) a caregiver providing care under that
59 waiver to complete training required by the Aging and Disability Services Division
60 of the Department. (NRS 422.3965) Sections 30 and 122 of this bill instead require
61 such a caregiver to complete the same training that is required for unlicensed
62 caregivers who provide care for an agency to provide personal care services in the
63 home.
-
*AB519_R1*

64 Existing law requires the Director of the Department to include in the State
65 Plan for Medicaid authorization for a recipient of Medicaid to be deemed a provider
66 of services for the purposes of allowing the recipient to receive reimbursement for
67 personal care services covered by Medicaid and using that money to pay for
68 services provided by a personal care assistant or an agency to provide personal care
69 services in the home. (NRS 422.272407). Section 120 of this bill authorizes a
70 family member of a recipient of Medicaid to serve as a personal care assistant for a
71 recipient of Medicaid if the family member: (1) completes the training required by
72 section 30 for certain other caregivers; and (2) receives authorization from a
73 provider of health care.
74 Section 147 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to move regulations
75 specifically relating to such entities to a new chapter of the Nevada Administrative
76 Code that corresponds to the new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes created
77 by sections 2-90. Section 147 also: (1) requires the Board to adopt new regulations
78 to replace other regulations relating to those entities that remain in the chapter of
79 the Nevada Administrative Code governing medical facilities and facilities for the
80 dependent; and (2) provides that those existing regulations remain in effect until the
81 Board adopts new regulations to replace them. Section 148 of this bill clarifies that
82 this bill does not affect the validity of: (1) licenses or certificates to operate
83 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
84 contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
85 or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations;
86 (2) certain training completed by the operators, employees and contractors of such
87 entities; or (3) disciplinary actions taken against such entities.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 519
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 519–COMMITTEE ON
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Creates a separate chapter of the Nevada Revised
Statutes governing certain agencies and
organizations that provide nonmedical services.
(BDR 40-805)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing separate provisions for
the licensing or certification, regulation and discipline of
agencies to provide personal care services in the home,
employment agencies that contract to provide certain
nonmedical services and intermediary service
organizations; enacting provisions to facilitate the
collecting of certain debts from applicants for certain
licenses; imposing certain requirements as an applicant
for a certificate to operate an intermediary service
organization; revising the training requirements for
certain caregivers who receive reimbursement through
Medicaid; authorizing a family member to serve as the
personal care assistant for a recipient of Medicaid under
certain circumstances; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of various types of
2 medical facilities and facilities for the dependent by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449
4 of NRS) Existing law requires an agency to provide personal care services in the
5 home to be licensed by the Division as a facility for the dependent. (NRS 449.0045,
6 449.030) Existing law requires an employment agency that contracts with persons
7 in this State to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly
8 persons or persons with disabilities in the home to obtain a license from the State
-
*AB519_R1*

– 2 –
9 Board of Health. (NRS 449.03005) Existing law requires an intermediary service
10 organization to obtain a certificate from the Division. (NRS 449.431) Existing law
11 requires the Board to adopt regulations governing agencies to provide personal care
12 services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide nonmedical
13 services related to personal care to elderly persons and persons with disabilities and
14 intermediary service organizations. (NRS 449.03005, 449.0302, 449.4309)
15 This bill transfers the provisions of law governing agencies to provide personal
16 care services in the home, employment agencies that contract to provide
17 nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons or persons with
18 disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations from the chapter of
19 the Nevada Revised Statutes that generally governs medical facilities and facilities
20 for the dependent to a new chapter in the Nevada Revised Statutes without
21 changing the current substantive provisions that govern such agencies and
22 organizations. Sections 2-19, 24-49, 51-60, 69-79 and 81-90 of this bill create a
23 new chapter consisting of provisions for the licensure and regulation of such
24 entities in a manner substantially identical to the manner in which those entities are
25 licensed and regulated under existing law. Sections 94, 96-104 and 150 of this bill
26 eliminate provisions governing those entities from the chapter of the Nevada
27 Revised Statutes that regulates medical facilities and facilities for the dependent.
28 Sections 93, 111, 113, 117, 118, 120-123, 126-133, 138 and 146 of this bill
29 eliminate references to sections repealed by section 150. Sections 91, 92, 95 and
30 105-146 of this bill make various conforming changes so that the legal status of
31 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
32 contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
33 or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations is
34 not changed by this bill.
35 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
36 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
37 obligations, including by requiring an applicant for such a license to provide his or
38 her social security number. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 20, 21 and 50 of this bill
39 enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a
40 license to operate an agency to provide personal care services in the home or an
41 employment agency that contracts to provide nonmedical services related to
42 personal care to elderly persons or persons with disabilities in the home in order to
43 comply with federal law. Section 23 of this bill establishes alternate provisions for
44 such an applicant who does not have a social security number. Section 22 of this
45 bill also requires an applicant for the renewal of such a license to provide certain
46 information for the purpose of identifying persons who owe certain debts to the
47 State. Sections 65, 69, 74 and 76 of this bill establish similar provisions for
48 intermediary service organizations, which were carried over from existing law.
49 (NRS 449.4312, 449.4313, 449.4315, 449.432, 449.4322)
50 Existing law requires: (1) an agency to provide personal care services in the
51 home to file with the Administrator of the Division a surety bond or a substitute for
52 a surety bond; and (2) an applicant for a license to operate an agency to provide
53 personal care services in the home to undergo a criminal background check. (NRS
54 449.065, 449.067, 449.122) Sections 67, 68 and 80 of this bill impose similar
55 requirements on intermediary service organizations.
56 Existing law requires: (1) the Department to apply for a home and community-
57 based services waiver to include structured family caregiving for certain persons as
58 medical assistance under Medicaid; and (2) a caregiver providing care under that
59 waiver to complete training required by the Aging and Disability Services Division
60 of the Department. (NRS 422.3965) Sections 30 and 122 of this bill instead require
61 such a caregiver to complete the same training that is required for unlicensed
62 caregivers who provide care for an agency to provide personal care services in the
63 home.
-
*AB519_R1*

64 Existing law requires the Director of the Department to include in the State
65 Plan for Medicaid authorization for a recipient of Medicaid to be deemed a provider
66 of services for the purposes of allowing the recipient to receive reimbursement for
67 personal care services covered by Medicaid and using that money to pay for
68 services provided by a personal care assistant or an agency to provide personal care
69 services in the home. (NRS 422.272407). Section 120 of this bill authorizes a
70 family member of a recipient of Medicaid to serve as a personal care assistant for a
71 recipient of Medicaid if the family member: (1) completes the training required by
72 section 30 for certain other caregivers; and (2) receives authorization from a
73 provider of health care.
74 Section 147 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to move regulations
75 specifically relating to such entities to a new chapter of the Nevada Administrative
76 Code that corresponds to the new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes created
77 by sections 2-90. Section 147 also: (1) requires the Board to adopt new regulations
78 to replace other regulations relating to those entities that remain in the chapter of
79 the Nevada Administrative Code governing medical facilities and facilities for the
80 dependent; and (2) provides that those existing regulations remain in effect until the
81 Board adopts new regulations to replace them. Section 148 of this bill clarifies that
82 this bill does not affect the validity of: (1) licenses or certificates to operate
83 agencies to provide personal care services in the home, employment agencies that
84 contract to provide nonmedical services related to personal care to elderly persons
85 or persons with disabilities in the home and intermediary service organizations;
86 (2) certain training completed by the operators, employees and contractors of such
87 entities; or (3) disciplinary actions taken against such entities.

22 upon sale pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 10, the successful
