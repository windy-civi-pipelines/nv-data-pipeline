8 INTERSTATE MINING COMPACT
9
10 ARTICLE I. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
11
12 (a) The party States find that:
13 1. Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and
14 well-being of every State are of basic significance.
15 2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, water
16 and other resources for other uses present special problems which
17 properly can be approached only with due consideration for the
18 rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or
19 proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the
20 public.
21 3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of
22 mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the
23 devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private
24 concern.
-
*SB464*
– 3 –
1 4. Such variables as soil structure and composition,
2 physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public
3 make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single
4 standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined
5 land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources;
6 but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the
7 effects of mining on lands, water, and other resources may be
8 reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly
9 from State to State for all mining operations similarly situated.
10 5. The States are in a position and have the responsibility to
11 assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound
12 conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.
13 (b) The purposes of this Compact are to:
14 1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, water
15 and other resources affected by mining.
16 2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of
17 pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to
18 mining.
19 3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional,
20 physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party
21 States which will achieve comparable results in protecting,
22 conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to
23 the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related
24 operations may be universally facilitated.
25 4. Assist the party States in their efforts to facilitate the use
26 of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use
27 may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public
28 safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever
29 desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or
30 protection of such land and other resources.
31 5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and
32 productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other
33 benefits attributable to mining.
34

8 INTERSTATE MINING COMPACT
9
10 ARTICLE I. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
11
12 (a) The party States find that:
13 1. Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and
14 well-being of every State are of basic significance.
15 2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, water
16 and other resources for other uses present special problems which
17 properly can be approached only with due consideration for the
18 rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or
19 proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the
20 public.
21 3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of
22 mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the
23 devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private
24 concern.
-
*SB464*

– 3 –
1 4. Such variables as soil structure and composition,
2 physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public
3 make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single
4 standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined
5 land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources;
6 but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the
7 effects of mining on lands, water, and other resources may be
8 reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly
9 from State to State for all mining operations similarly situated.
10 5. The States are in a position and have the responsibility to
11 assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound
12 conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.
13 (b) The purposes of this Compact are to:
14 1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, water
15 and other resources affected by mining.
16 2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of
17 pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to
18 mining.
19 3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional,
20 physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party
21 States which will achieve comparable results in protecting,
22 conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to
23 the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related
24 operations may be universally facilitated.
25 4. Assist the party States in their efforts to facilitate the use
26 of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use
27 may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public
28 safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever
29 desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or
30 protection of such land and other resources.
31 5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and
32 productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other
33 benefits attributable to mining.
34
35 ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS

11 formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation
12 and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards,
13 enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to
14 accomplish:
15 1. The protection of the public and the protection of
16 adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and
17 the structures and other property thereon resulting from the
18 conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of
19 land and property formerly used in the conduct of such
20 operations.
21 2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and
22 other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the
23 economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of
24 land and water.
25 3. The institution and maintenance of suitable programs of
26 adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands.
27 4. The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and

11 the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining
12 operations.
13 8. Study and make recommendations relating to the
14 safeguarding of access to resources which are or may become
15 the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the
16 economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected
17 by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources
18 containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or
19 potential mining sites.

15 hereof, the Commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the
16 allotment of funds by the party States adequate to meet the same.
17 (d) The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all
18 receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the
