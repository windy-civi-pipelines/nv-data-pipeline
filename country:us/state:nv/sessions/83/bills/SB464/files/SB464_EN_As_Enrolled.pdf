Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Interstate Mining Compact is an interstate compact which addresses issues
relating to mining, including, without limitation, the economic impacts, the effects
on natural resources, the protection of the environment and public health and
safety. The Compact requires each state that is a party to formulate and establish a
program for the conservation and use of mined lands for certain purposes. The
Compact creates the Interstate Mining Commission composed of one commissioner
from each party state who is the governor of that state or an alternate designated by
the Governor. The Commission is charged with certain duties, which include: (1)
studying issues relating to mining operations, processes and techniques and the
conservation and restoration of land affected by mining; (2) making
recommendations relating to mining; (3) gathering and disseminating information
relating to mining; (4) cooperating with the Federal Government and any public
and private entities interested in mining; and (5) upon the request of a party state,
consulting with officials in the state on issues relating to mining.
Section 2 of this bill enacts the Interstate Mining Compact. Section 3 of this
bill authorizes the Governor to designate a representative to serve as the alternate of
the Governor to the Compact and on the Commission.
Section 4 of this bill provides that: (1) the provisions of the Compact and any
policy of the Commission do not limit, repeal or supersede any law of this State;
and (2) the State of Nevada is not liable for certain obligations or solvency of the
Commission.
Section 5 of this bill provides that the Governor and the Legislature or their
designated agents have the right to inspect the books and accounts of the
Commission.
Section 6 of this bill requires: (1) the Interstate Mining Commission, as
directed in the Compact, to file a copy of the bylaws of the Commission with the
Division of Minerals of the Commission on Mineral Resources; and (2) the
Division to make a copy of the bylaws available for inspection by the public or
the Legislature. Section 6 also requires the Administrator of the Division to pay the
annual membership dues of the Interstate Mining Commission from the Account
for the Division of Minerals or, if authorized, from certain grants from the Federal
Government.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Chapter 513 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of this
act.
Sec. 2. The Interstate Mining Compact is hereby ratified,
enacted and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining the
Compact, in substantially the form set forth in this section:
INTERSTATE MINING COMPACT
ARTICLE I. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
(a) The party States find that:
1. Mining and the contributions thereof to the economy and
well-being of every State are of basic significance.
2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, water
and other resources for other uses present special problems which
properly can be approached only with due consideration for the
rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or
proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the
public.
3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of
mining on land, water and other resources may be costly and the
devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private
concern.
4. Such variables as soil structure and composition,
physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public
make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single
standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined
land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources;
but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the
effects of mining on lands, water, and other resources may be
reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly
from State to State for all mining operations similarly situated.
5. The States are in a position and have the responsibility to
assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound
conservation principles, and with due regard for local conditions.
(b) The purposes of this Compact are to:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
1. Advance the protection and restoration of land, water
and other resources affected by mining.
2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of
pollution or deterioration of land, water and air attributable to
mining.
3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional,
physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party
States which will achieve comparable results in protecting,
conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to
the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related
operations may be universally facilitated.
4. Assist the party States in their efforts to facilitate the use
of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use
may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public
safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever
desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or
protection of such land and other resources.
5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and
productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other
benefits attributable to mining.
ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS
As used in this Compact, the term:
(a) “Mining” means the breaking of the surface soil in order
to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals,
ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all
or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores,
and other solid matter from its original location, and the
preparation, washing, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals,
ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for
commercial, industrial, or construction use; but shall not include
those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the
surface, and shall not include excavation of grading when
conducted solely in aid of on-site farming or construction.
(b) “State” means a State of the United States, the District of
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a Territory or
Possession of the United States.

and use of mined land, by the establishment of standards,
enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to
accomplish:
1. The protection of the public and the protection of
adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and
the structures and other property thereon resulting from the
conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of
land and property formerly used in the conduct of such
operations.
2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and
other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the
economic, residential, recreational or aesthetic value and utility of
land and water.
3. The institution and maintenance of suitable programs of
adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands.
4. The prevention, abatement and control of water, air and

total number of votes on the Commission is cast in favor thereof.
All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting:

estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall
indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information
concerning value of minerals, ores, and other solid matter mined.
