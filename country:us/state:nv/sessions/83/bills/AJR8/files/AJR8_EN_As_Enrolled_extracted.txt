ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
establishment of a business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to authorize
the Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
establishment of a business court which, if established, will have exclusive original
jurisdiction to hear disputes involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions,
fiduciary duties, receiverships involving business entities and other commercial or
contractual disputes between business entities and any other business disputes of a
similar nature in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. If the Legislature
establishes a business court, the constitutional amendment proposed by this
resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a Special Nominating
Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business court judge; (2)
provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor from
among three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission; (3) prescribe by
law the powers, duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and (4) fix by law
the terms of any such judges. The constitutional amendment proposed by this
resolution also provides that if the Legislature establishes a business court, the
Supreme Court will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of cases within the
original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional amendment
proposed by this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in the
Nevada Constitution relating to the business court.

FILE NUMBER..........
ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
Nevada Constitution to authorize the Legislature, to
the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
establishment of a business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to authorize
the Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
establishment of a business court which, if established, will have exclusive original
jurisdiction to hear disputes involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions,
fiduciary duties, receiverships involving business entities and other commercial or
contractual disputes between business entities and any other business disputes of a
similar nature in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. If the Legislature
establishes a business court, the constitutional amendment proposed by this
resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a Special Nominating
Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business court judge; (2)
provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor from
among three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission; (3) prescribe by
law the powers, duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and (4) fix by law
the terms of any such judges. The constitutional amendment proposed by this
resolution also provides that if the Legislature establishes a business court, the
Supreme Court will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of cases within the
original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional amendment
proposed by this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in the
Nevada Constitution relating to the business court.
