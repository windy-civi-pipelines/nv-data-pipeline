ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to require the Legislature, to the extent money is
available, to provide by law for the establishment of a business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to require the
2 Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the establishment of a
3 business court which, if established, will have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear disputes
4 involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, fiduciary duties, receiverships
5 involving business entities and other commercial or contractual disputes between business
6 entities and any other business disputes of a similar nature in which equitable or
7 declaratory relief is sought. If the Legislature establishes a business court, the constitutional
8 amendment proposed by this resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a
9 Special Nominating Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business
10 court judge; (2) provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor
11 from among three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission [on Judicial Selection;
12 (2)] ; (3) prescribe by law the powers, duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and [(3)]
13 (4) fix by law the terms of any such judges. The constitutional amendment proposed by this
14 resolution also provides that if the Legislature establishes a business court, the Supreme Court
15 [and the court of appeals] will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of cases within the
16 original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional amendment proposed by
17 this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in the Nevada Constitution
18 relating to the business court.

10 the chief judge of the business court may, in his or her reasonable
11 discretion, order the transfer of a dispute presented to the business court
12 to the appropriate district court if the chief judge finds that the dispute
13 would be more appropriately adjudicated in the district court.
14 3. If the Legislature provides by law for the establishment of a
15 business court pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislature shall:
16 (a) Establish by law a Special Nominating Commission for the

ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to require the Legislature, to the extent money is
available, to provide by law for the establishment of a business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to require the
2 Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the establishment of a
3 business court which, if established, will have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear disputes
4 involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, fiduciary duties, receiverships
5 involving business entities and other commercial or contractual disputes between business
6 entities and any other business disputes of a similar nature in which equitable or
7 declaratory relief is sought. If the Legislature establishes a business court, the constitutional
8 amendment proposed by this resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a
9 Special Nominating Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business
10 court judge; (2) provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor
11 from among three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission [on Judicial Selection;
12 (2)] ; (3) prescribe by law the powers, duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and [(3)]
13 (4) fix by law the terms of any such judges. The constitutional amendment proposed by this
14 resolution also provides that if the Legislature establishes a business court, the Supreme Court
15 [and the court of appeals] will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of cases within the
16 original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional amendment proposed by
17 this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in the Nevada Constitution
18 relating to the business court.
1 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
2 That a new section, designated Section 3B, be added to Article 6 of the Nevada
3 Constitution to read as follows:

5 provide by law for the establishment of a business court consisting of

Assembly Amendment No. 149 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 8 Page 4
1 three judges or such greater number as the Legislature may provide by
2 law [.] pursuant to subsection 9.
3 2. If the Legislature provides by law for the establishment of a
4 business court pursuant to subsection 1, the business court shall have
5 exclusive original jurisdiction to hear disputes involving shareholder
6 rights, mergers and acquisitions, fiduciary duties, receiverships involving
7 business entities and other commercial or contractual disputes between
8 business entities and any other business disputes of a similar nature in
9 which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. Upon receipt of a petition,
10 the chief judge of the business court may, in his or her reasonable
11 discretion, order the transfer of a dispute presented to the business court
12 to the appropriate district court if the chief judge finds that the dispute
13 would be more appropriately adjudicated in the district court.
14 3. If the Legislature provides by law for the establishment of a
15 business court pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislature shall:
16 (a) Establish by law a Special Nominating Commission for the
17 selection of nominees for the office of business court judge and prescribe
18 by law the composition of the Commission in accordance with subsection
19 5;
20 (b) Prescribe by law the procedures governing the nomination
21 process of the Special Nominating Commission;
22 (c) Provide for the appointment of:
23 (1) Business court judges by the Governor in accordance with
24 subsection 4; and
25 (2) A chief judge of the business court by the Chief Justice of the
26 Supreme Court;
27 [(b)] (d) Prescribe by law the powers, duties and responsibilities of
28 business court judges in accordance with subsection [5;] 6; and
29 [(c)] (e) Fix by law the:
30 (1) Terms of office of business court judges in accordance with
31 subsection [6;] 7; and
32 (2) Term of a chief judge of the business court in accordance
33 with subsection [7.] 8.
34 4. The judges of the business court must be appointed by the
35 Governor from among three nominees selected for each individual seat by
36 the [permanent] Special Nominating Commission [on Judicial Selection

38 Section 20 of this Article.] A nominee selected by the Commission must,
39 as determined in the reasonable discretion of the Commission, have
40 substantial experience as a practitioner or judge in one or more areas of
41 law within the jurisdiction of the business court.
42 5. The Special Nominating Commission must be composed of:

4 judge who desires to succeed himself or herself must, on or before July 1
5 next preceding the expiration of his or her term of office, declare his or
6 her candidacy in the manner provided by law. With respect to each
7 business court judge who so declares, the question must be presented at
8 the next general election, in a form provided by law, whether that
9 business court judge shall succeed himself or herself. If 55 percent or
10 more of the votes cast on the question are in favor of the business court
11 judge succeeding himself or herself, the business court judge shall
12 succeed himself or herself. The term of office of each business court
13 judge who succeeds himself or herself is 6 years, and that term begins on

1 Supreme Court, any justice who sat on the Commission for that proceeding
2 is disqualified from participating in the consideration or decision of the
3 appeal. When any member of the Commission is disqualified by this
4 subsection, the Supreme Court shall appoint a substitute from among the
5 eligible judges.
