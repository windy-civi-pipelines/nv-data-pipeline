ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
Nevada Constitution to require the Legislature, to the
extent money is available, to provide by law for
the establishment of a business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to require
2 the Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
3 establishment of a business court which, if established, will have exclusive original
4 jurisdiction to hear disputes involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions,
5 fiduciary duties, receiverships involving business entities and other commercial or
6 business disputes in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. If the
7 Legislature establishes a business court, the constitutional amendment proposed by
8 this resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) provide by law for the appointment of
9 business court judges by the Governor from among three nominees for each seat
10 chosen by the Commission on Judicial Selection; (2) prescribe by law the powers,
11 duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and (3) fix by law the terms of any
12 such judges. The constitutional amendment proposed by this resolution also
13 provides that if the Legislature establishes a business court, the Supreme Court and
14 the court of appeals will have appellate jurisdiction of cases within the original
15 jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional amendment proposed
16 by this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in the Nevada
17 Constitution relating to the business court.
