ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to [require] authorize the Legislature, to the extent
money is available, to provide by law for the establishment of a
business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to [require] authorize
2 the Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the establishment of a
3 business court which, if established, will have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear disputes
4 involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, fiduciary duties, receiverships
5 involving business entities and other commercial or contractual disputes between business
6 entities and any other business disputes of a similar nature in which equitable or declaratory
7 relief is sought. If the Legislature establishes a business court, the constitutional amendment
8 proposed by this resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a Special
9 Nominating Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business court judge;
10 (2) provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor from among
11 three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission; (3) prescribe by law the powers,
12 duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and (4) fix by law the terms of any such judges.
13 The constitutional amendment proposed by this resolution also provides that if the Legislature
14 establishes a business court, the Supreme Court will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of
15 cases within the original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional
16 amendment proposed by this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in
17 the Nevada Constitution relating to the business court.
1 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
2 That a new section, designated Section 3B, be added to Article 6 of the Nevada

4 rights, mergers and acquisitions, fiduciary duties, receiverships involving

6 business entities and any other business disputes of a similar nature in
7 which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. Upon receipt of a petition,
8 the chief judge of the business court may, in his or her reasonable
9 discretion, order the transfer of a dispute presented to the business court
10 to the appropriate district court if the chief judge finds that the dispute
11 would be more appropriately adjudicated in the district court.
12 3. If the Legislature provides by law for the establishment of a
13 business court pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislature shall:
14 (a) Establish by law a Special Nominating Commission for the
15 selection of nominees for the office of business court judge and prescribe
16 by law the composition of the Commission in accordance with subsection
17 5;
18 (b) Prescribe by law the procedures governing the nomination
19 process of the Special Nominating Commission;
20 (c) Provide for the appointment of:

5 business court judge shall succeed himself or herself. If 55 percent or
6 more of the votes cast on the question are in favor of the business court
7 judge succeeding himself or herself, the business court judge shall
8 succeed himself or herself. The term of office of each business court
9 judge who succeeds himself or herself is 6 years, and that term begins on
10 the first Monday of January next following the general election at which
11 the business court judge was chosen to succeed himself or herself. If a

14 succeeding himself or herself, a vacancy is created at the expiration of his
15 or her term which must be filled by appointment pursuant to subsection 4.

24 available therefor, provide by law for an increase or decrease in the
25 number of business court judges or divisions of the business court as may
26 be necessary for the proper and timely administration of the business
27 court docket.

ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to [require] authorize the Legislature, to the extent
money is available, to provide by law for the establishment of a
business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to [require] authorize
2 the Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the establishment of a
3 business court which, if established, will have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear disputes
4 involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions, fiduciary duties, receiverships
5 involving business entities and other commercial or contractual disputes between business
6 entities and any other business disputes of a similar nature in which equitable or declaratory
7 relief is sought. If the Legislature establishes a business court, the constitutional amendment
8 proposed by this resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a Special
9 Nominating Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business court judge;
10 (2) provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor from among
11 three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission; (3) prescribe by law the powers,
12 duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and (4) fix by law the terms of any such judges.
13 The constitutional amendment proposed by this resolution also provides that if the Legislature
14 establishes a business court, the Supreme Court will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of
15 cases within the original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional
16 amendment proposed by this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in
17 the Nevada Constitution relating to the business court.

7 which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. Upon receipt of a petition,
8 the chief judge of the business court may, in his or her reasonable
9 discretion, order the transfer of a dispute presented to the business court
10 to the appropriate district court if the chief judge finds that the dispute
11 would be more appropriately adjudicated in the district court.
12 3. If the Legislature provides by law for the establishment of a
13 business court pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislature shall:
14 (a) Establish by law a Special Nominating Commission for the
