ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
Nevada Constitution to authorize the Legislature, to
the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
establishment of a business court.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This resolution proposes an amendment to the Nevada Constitution to authorize
2 the Legislature, to the extent money is available, to provide by law for the
3 establishment of a business court which, if established, will have exclusive original
4 jurisdiction to hear disputes involving shareholder rights, mergers and acquisitions,
5 fiduciary duties, receiverships involving business entities and other commercial or
6 contractual disputes between business entities and any other business disputes of a
7 similar nature in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought. If the Legislature
8 establishes a business court, the constitutional amendment proposed by this
9 resolution requires the Legislature to: (1) establish by law a Special Nominating
10 Commission for the selection of nominees for the office of business court judge; (2)
11 provide by law for the appointment of business court judges by the Governor from
12 among three nominees for each seat chosen by the Commission; (3) prescribe by
13 law the powers, duties and responsibilities of any such judges; and (4) fix by law
14 the terms of any such judges. The constitutional amendment proposed by this
15 resolution also provides that if the Legislature establishes a business court, the
16 Supreme Court will have exclusive appellate jurisdiction of cases within the
17 original jurisdiction of the business court. Finally, the constitutional amendment
18 proposed by this resolution makes various conforming changes to provisions in the
19 Nevada Constitution relating to the business court.
