AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits vehicles from stopping, standing or parking within 20
2 feet of a crosswalk. (NRS 484B.450) Section 1 of this bill makes various changes
3 to apply the 20-foot prohibition to both marked and unmarked crosswalks, and in
4 circumstances where there is a curb extension present, applies the prohibition to
5 within 15 feet of the marked or unmarked crosswalk.
6 Existing law authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance for the purpose
7 of erecting official traffic-control devices that regulate the stopping, standing or
8 parking of vehicles on any highway under its jurisdiction. (NRS 484B.520)
9 Existing law defines “official traffic-control device” as certain signs, signals,
10 markings and other devices that are placed or erected by a public authority or
11 railroad for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic. (NRS 484A.145)
12 Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance
13 for the purpose of establishing a variance from the default distance for stopping,
14 standing or parking within a marked or unmarked crosswalk if the deviation is
15 necessary to protect the safety of the community and the local authority erects
16 official traffic-control devices to provide notice of the distance applicable to the
17 jurisdiction.
18 Section 2 provides that, through December 31, 2026, the prohibition relating to
19 stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a marked or
20 unmarked crosswalk may only be enforced through the issuance of a warning and
21 such enforcement is only permitted in circumstances where notice of the distance
22 applicable to the jurisdiction is provided by an official traffic-control device.
23 Section 3 of this bill removes these restrictions effective January 1, 2027, thereby
24 authorizing a law enforcement officer to take any applicable enforcement actions
25 relating to stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a marked
