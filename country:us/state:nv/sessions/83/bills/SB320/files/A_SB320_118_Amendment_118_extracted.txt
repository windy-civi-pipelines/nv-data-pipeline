SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to crosswalks. (BDR 43-9)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing stopping, standing
or parking near a crosswalk; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits vehicles from stopping, standing or parking within 20 feet of a
2 crosswalk. (NRS 484B.450) Section 1 of this bill [makes various changes to apply] applies
3 the 20-foot prohibition to both marked and unmarked crosswalks . [, and in circumstances
4 where there is a curb extension present, applies the prohibition to within 15 feet of the marked
5 or unmarked crosswalk.]
6 Existing law authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance for the purpose of erecting
7 official traffic-control devices that regulate the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles on
8 any highway under its jurisdiction. (NRS 484B.520) Existing law defines “official traffic-
9 control device” as certain signs, signals, markings and other devices that are placed or erected
10 by a public authority or railroad for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic.
11 (NRS 484A.145) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a local authority to adopt an
12 ordinance for the purpose of establishing a [variance from] greater distance than the default
13 distance for stopping, standing or parking [within] near a marked or unmarked crosswalk if
14 the deviation is necessary to protect the safety of the community and the local authority erects
15 official traffic-control devices to provide notice of the distance applicable to the jurisdiction.
16 Section 2 provides that, through December 31, 2026, the prohibition relating to stopping,
17 standing or parking within the specified distance of a marked or unmarked crosswalk may
18 only be enforced through the issuance of a warning and such enforcement is only permitted in
19 circumstances where notice of the distance applicable to the jurisdiction is provided by an
20 official traffic-control device. Section 3 of this bill removes these restrictions effective on
21 January 1, 2027, thereby authorizing a law enforcement officer to take any applicable
22 enforcement actions relating to stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a
23 marked or unmarked crosswalk, regardless of whether notice of the prohibition was provided
24 by an official traffic-control device.
