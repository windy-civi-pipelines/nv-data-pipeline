SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to crosswalks.
(BDR 43-9)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
stopping, standing or parking near a crosswalk; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits vehicles from stopping, standing or parking within 20
2 feet of a crosswalk. (NRS 484B.450) Section 1 of this bill applies the 20-foot
3 prohibition to both marked and unmarked crosswalks.
4 Existing law authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance for the purpose
5 of erecting official traffic-control devices that regulate the stopping, standing or
6 parking of vehicles on any highway under its jurisdiction. (NRS 484B.520)
7 Existing law defines “official traffic-control device” as certain signs, signals,
8 markings and other devices that are placed or erected by a public authority or
9 railroad for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic. (NRS 484A.145)
10 Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance
11 for the purpose of establishing a greater distance than the default distance for
12 stopping, standing or parking near a marked or unmarked crosswalk if the deviation
13 is necessary to protect the safety of the community and the local authority erects
14 official traffic-control devices to provide notice of the distance applicable to the
15 jurisdiction.
16 Section 2 provides that, through December 31, 2026, the prohibition relating to
17 stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a marked or
18 unmarked crosswalk may only be enforced through the issuance of a warning and
19 such enforcement is only permitted in circumstances where notice of the distance
20 applicable to the jurisdiction is provided by an official traffic-control device.
21 Section 3 of this bill removes these restrictions effective on January 1, 2027,
22 thereby authorizing a law enforcement officer to take any applicable enforcement
23 actions relating to stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a
24 marked or unmarked crosswalk, regardless of whether notice of the prohibition was
25 provided by an official traffic-control device.
