Senate Bill No. 320–Senator Scheible
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
stopping, standing or parking near a crosswalk; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits vehicles from stopping, standing or parking within 20
feet of a crosswalk. (NRS 484B.450) Section 1 of this bill applies the 20-foot
prohibition to both marked and unmarked crosswalks.
Existing law authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance for the purpose
of erecting official traffic-control devices that regulate the stopping, standing or
parking of vehicles on any highway under its jurisdiction. (NRS 484B.520)
Existing law defines “official traffic-control device” as certain signs, signals,
markings and other devices that are placed or erected by a public authority or
railroad for the purpose of regulating, warning or guiding traffic. (NRS 484A.145)
Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a local authority to adopt an ordinance
for the purpose of establishing a greater distance than the default distance for
stopping, standing or parking near a marked or unmarked crosswalk if the deviation
is necessary to protect the safety of the community and the local authority erects
official traffic-control devices to provide notice of the distance applicable to the
jurisdiction.
Section 2 provides that, through December 31, 2026, the prohibition relating to
stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a marked or
unmarked crosswalk may only be enforced through the issuance of a warning and
such enforcement is only permitted in circumstances where notice of the distance
applicable to the jurisdiction is provided by an official traffic-control device.
Section 3 of this bill removes these restrictions effective on January 1, 2027,
thereby authorizing a law enforcement officer to take any applicable enforcement
actions relating to stopping, standing or parking within the specified distance of a
marked or unmarked crosswalk, regardless of whether notice of the prohibition was
provided by an official traffic-control device.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
