EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions relating to
fee waivers for certain students; providing for the
continuity of waivers previously provided to certain
students; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada from
2 assessing, with certain exceptions, tuition charges against certain students,
3 including those who are bona fide residents of this State. (NRS 396.540) Existing
4 law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration, laboratory
5 and other mandatory fees assessed against certain students, including a student who
6 is: (1) an active member of the Nevada National Guard; (2) the child, widow or
7 widower of a person killed while performing duties as a member of the Nevada
8 National Guard; (3) a veteran who has been awarded the Purple Heart or the child
9 of such a veteran; (4) the child or spouse of a person identified as a prisoner of war
10 or missing in action while performing duties as a member of the Armed Forces of
11 the United States; (5) identified as a homeless or unaccompanied pupil; and (6) a
12 member or a descendent of a member of certain Indian tribes. Existing law provides
13 that in most cases, a student to whom a waiver is granted: (1) is deemed to be a
14 bona fide resident of this State for the purpose of assessing tuition and fees; (2)
15 must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 to be eligible for the
16 waiver; and (3) is limited to using the waiver for certain courses and programs.
17 (NRS 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections 2-8
18 of this bill eliminate these and other similar provisions prescribing the terms and
19 limitations of certain fee waivers granted to students who meet certain eligibility

20 criteria. Instead, section 1 of this bill establishes a consolidated waiver which
21 requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration, laboratory and other
22 mandatory fees assessed against a student enrolled full-time or part-time in certain
23 undergraduate or graduate degree programs and who meets certain eligibility
24 criteria.
25 Section 1 limits the applicability of the consolidated waiver to certain
26 undergraduate and graduate courses and programs of study. In order to receive a
27 waiver under section 1, an eligible student must: (1) complete the Free Application
28 for Federal Student Aid, if the student is eligible under federal law to complete the
29 application; and (2) maintain at least a 2.0 grade point average, on a 4.0 grading
30 scale, each semester, or its equivalent if a different scale is used. Section 1 requires
31 the Board of Regents to apply all scholarships, grants and other financial assistance,
32 not including loans, to which a student is entitled for a semester towards the fees
33 assessed against the student for that semester before granting a waiver to cover the
34 remaining balance of those fees. Section 1 authorizes the Board of Regents to seek
35 certain assistance to verify the eligibility of a student to receive a waiver. Section 1
36 also requires the Board of Regents to treat a student who is granted a fee waiver as
37 a bona fide resident of this State for the purpose of assessing fees and tuition
38 charges.
39 Section 1 requires the Board of Regents to publish the programs and courses
40 for which the waiver may be used before the start of each semester. Sections 2-8
41 make conforming changes to apply the terms of the waiver established by section 1
42 to all existing waivers and revise internal references. Section 9 of this bill provides
43 that a student who is currently enrolled in the System as of July 1, 2025, and who
44 has been granted a waiver under existing law for a program which is not covered by
45 section 1 is entitled to continue to use that waiver for that program until July 1,
46 2029, if the waiver granted under section 1 would not cover such program.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 532–COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION)
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to fee waivers granted by
the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada.
(BDR 34-524)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to higher education; revising provisions relating to
fee waivers for certain students; providing for the
continuity of waivers previously provided to certain
students; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada from
2 assessing, with certain exceptions, tuition charges against certain students,
3 including those who are bona fide residents of this State. (NRS 396.540) Existing
4 law authorizes the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration, laboratory
5 and other mandatory fees assessed against certain students, including a student who
6 is: (1) an active member of the Nevada National Guard; (2) the child, widow or
7 widower of a person killed while performing duties as a member of the Nevada
8 National Guard; (3) a veteran who has been awarded the Purple Heart or the child
9 of such a veteran; (4) the child or spouse of a person identified as a prisoner of war
10 or missing in action while performing duties as a member of the Armed Forces of
11 the United States; (5) identified as a homeless or unaccompanied pupil; and (6) a
12 member or a descendent of a member of certain Indian tribes. Existing law provides
13 that in most cases, a student to whom a waiver is granted: (1) is deemed to be a
14 bona fide resident of this State for the purpose of assessing tuition and fees; (2)
15 must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 to be eligible for the
16 waiver; and (3) is limited to using the waiver for certain courses and programs.
17 (NRS 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5448, 396.5449) Sections 2-8
18 of this bill eliminate these and other similar provisions prescribing the terms and
19 limitations of certain fee waivers granted to students who meet certain eligibility

– 2 –
20 criteria. Instead, section 1 of this bill establishes a consolidated waiver which
21 requires the Board of Regents to waive all registration, laboratory and other
22 mandatory fees assessed against a student enrolled full-time or part-time in certain
23 undergraduate or graduate degree programs and who meets certain eligibility
24 criteria.
25 Section 1 limits the applicability of the consolidated waiver to certain
26 undergraduate and graduate courses and programs of study. In order to receive a
27 waiver under section 1, an eligible student must: (1) complete the Free Application
28 for Federal Student Aid, if the student is eligible under federal law to complete the
29 application; and (2) maintain at least a 2.0 grade point average, on a 4.0 grading
30 scale, each semester, or its equivalent if a different scale is used. Section 1 requires
31 the Board of Regents to apply all scholarships, grants and other financial assistance,
32 not including loans, to which a student is entitled for a semester towards the fees
33 assessed against the student for that semester before granting a waiver to cover the
34 remaining balance of those fees. Section 1 authorizes the Board of Regents to seek
35 certain assistance to verify the eligibility of a student to receive a waiver. Section 1
36 also requires the Board of Regents to treat a student who is granted a fee waiver as
37 a bona fide resident of this State for the purpose of assessing fees and tuition
38 charges.
39 Section 1 requires the Board of Regents to publish the programs and courses
40 for which the waiver may be used before the start of each semester. Sections 2-8
41 make conforming changes to apply the terms of the waiver established by section 1
42 to all existing waivers and revise internal references. Section 9 of this bill provides
43 that a student who is currently enrolled in the System as of July 1, 2025, and who
44 has been granted a waiver under existing law for a program which is not covered by
45 section 1 is entitled to continue to use that waiver for that program until July 1,
46 2029, if the waiver granted under section 1 would not cover such program.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 396 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:

8 meets the criteria for a waiver established pursuant to NRS
9 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445, 396.5448 or 396.5449. A
10 waiver must not be granted for a student in a trade or vocational
11 program or a professional program.
12 2. The amount of a waiver granted pursuant to subsection 1
13 must be equal to the balance of all registration fees, laboratory
14 fees and any other mandatory fees assessed against a student for a
15 semester after the application of all scholarships, grants and other
16 financial assistance, with the exception of loans, including,
17 without limitation, federal student aid, federal educational benefits

5 including, without limitation, tuition charges assessed pursuant to
6 NRS 396.540, such a student shall be deemed a bona fide resident
7 of this State.

18 (a) Establish policies and procedures prescribing the manner
19 by which a student may apply for a waiver under this section.
20 (b) Publish, on the Internet website maintained by each
21 institution in the System, a list of the undergraduate and graduate
22 programs and courses at the institution that will be covered by the
23 waiver granted pursuant to this section.
24 (c) Ensure that any waiver of registration fees, laboratory fees
25 and any other mandatory fees established by the Board of Regents
26 for which the qualifications, terms and conditions are not
27 established by law is administered in a manner that is consistent
28 with the provisions of this section, such that the administration of
29 fee waivers by the Board of Regents is as uniform as possible.
30 6. The Board of Regents may:
31 (a) Determine whether grants are available to assist the System
32 in defraying the costs of granting waivers pursuant to this section
33 and apply for and accept any such grants.
34 (b) Accept gifts, grants, bequests and donations to fund the
35 waivers granted under this section.
36 (c) Seek assistance from any state agency, board, department,
37 division, commission or officer to verify the eligibility of a student
38 to receive a waiver.
39 (d) Request documentation from a student to confirm his or
40 her eligibility for a waiver.
41 (e) Establish policies and procedures necessary to carry out
42 the provisions of this section.
43 7. As used in this section, “other mandatory fees” includes,
44 without limitation, differential program fees, special course fees,
45 student fees and technology fees.
