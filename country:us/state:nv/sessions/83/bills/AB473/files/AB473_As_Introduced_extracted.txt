5 2. Money appropriated by subsection 1 may be:
6 (a) Granted to a forensic laboratory designated by a board of
7 county commissioners to carry out the program.
8 (b) Used only:
9 (1) To conduct genetic marker analyses for unidentified
10 deceased persons; and
11 (2) If the DNA profile resulting from the genetic marker
12 analysis fails to yield a match in CODIS, for forensic genetic
13 genealogy DNA testing.
14 3. Any remaining balance of the appropriation made by
15 subsection 1 must not be committed for expenditure after June 30,
16 2027, by the entity to which the appropriation is made or any entity
17 to which money from the appropriation is granted or otherwise

12 exchange of DNA records submitted by federal, state and local
13 forensic DNA laboratories.
14 (c) “DNA” means deoxyribonucleic acid, which is located in the
15 cells of a person and which provides the genetic blueprint of a
16 person.
17 (d) “DNA profile” means the genetic constitution of a person at
18 defined locations in the DNA of the person.
19 (e) “Forensic genetic genealogy DNA testing” means any testing
