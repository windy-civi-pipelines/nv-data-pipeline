SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to elections.
(BDR 24-202)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1-3, 5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising the circumstances under
which a candidate defeated at certain elections or a voter
may demand a recount; requiring, under certain
circumstances, that a recount for certain elections be
conducted; requiring certain costs for certain recounts to
be repaid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
Account; creating the Voter Access Grant Program and
the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a candidate defeated at
2 certain elections to demand and receive a recount of the vote for the office for
3 which he or she is a candidate if he or she deposits the estimated costs for the
4 recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1 of this bill instead: (1) authorizes a defeated
5 candidate to demand a recount in certain elections if the difference between the
6 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the number of votes
7 cast for the defeated candidate who demands the recount is 5 percent or less; and
8 (2) reorganizes the provisions of existing law that set forth how the estimated costs
9 of the recount are determined. Section 1 additionally requires, with certain
10 exceptions, a recount of the vote for an office to be conducted, at no cost to any
11 candidate, if the difference between the highest number of votes cast for a
12 candidate for the office and the next highest number of votes cast for a candidate
13 for the office is 0.25 percent or less. Such a recount is not required to be conducted
14 if the format of the ballot allowed a voter to select more than one candidate for the
15 office, unless the difference between the number of votes cast in the election for the
-
*AB287_R1*
– 2 –
16 candidate with the lowest number of votes who won the election and the next
17 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less.
18 Existing law authorizes a voter at an election to demand and receive a recount
19 of the vote for a ballot question if the registered voter deposits the estimated costs
20 of the recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1: (1) instead authorizes a voter to demand
21 and receive a recount of the vote for a ballot question only if the difference between
22 the results of the ballot question being approved or disapproved is 5 percent or less;
23 and (2) additionally requires a recount of the vote for a ballot question to be
24 conducted if the difference between the results of the ballot question being
25 approved or disapproved is 0.25 percent or less.
26 Sections 2-5 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the changes to
27 the recount process made pursuant to section 1.
28 Existing law: (1) requires, under certain circumstances, the State Board of
29 Examiners to repay the allowable costs from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
30 Account to each county for a recount that concerns an office or ballot question for
31 which voting is statewide; and (2) sets forth a process for the review, submission
32 and approval of such costs. (NRS 293.405) If a recount of the vote for an office or
33 ballot question for which voting is statewide is required pursuant to section 1,
34 rather than demanded, section 3 requires: (1) the clerk of each county to submit a
35 statement of its costs in the recount to the Secretary of State for review and
36 approval; (2) the Secretary of State to submit such statements to the State Board of
37 Examiners; and (3) the State Board of Examiners to repay the allowable costs from
38 the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account to the respective counties.
39 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to serve as the Chief Officer of
40 Elections for this State and to be responsible for the execution and enforcement of
41 the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes and all other provisions of state and
42 federal law relating to elections. (NRS 293.124) Section 7 of this bill requires the
43 Secretary of State to establish and administer the Voter Access Grant Program to
44 provide grants of money from the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program
45 created by section 8 of this bill to eligible entities to support the administration of
46 elections and improve voter access. For the purpose of providing such grants, an
47 “eligible entity” is defined by section 7 to mean a county, city or tribal government.

6 candidate and the number of votes received for the person who won

42 conducted if, after the canvass of the vote and the certification by

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 287–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS
GONZÁLEZ AND MONROE-MORENO

____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to elections.
(BDR 24-202)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1-3, 5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising the circumstances under
which a candidate defeated at certain elections or a voter
may demand a recount; requiring, under certain
circumstances, that a recount for certain elections be
conducted; requiring certain costs for certain recounts to
be repaid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
Account; creating the Voter Access Grant Program and
the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a candidate defeated at
2 certain elections to demand and receive a recount of the vote for the office for
3 which he or she is a candidate if he or she deposits the estimated costs for the
4 recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1 of this bill instead: (1) authorizes a defeated
5 candidate to demand a recount in certain elections if the difference between the
6 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the number of votes
7 cast for the defeated candidate who demands the recount is 5 percent or less; and
8 (2) reorganizes the provisions of existing law that set forth how the estimated costs
9 of the recount are determined. Section 1 additionally requires, with certain
10 exceptions, a recount of the vote for an office to be conducted, at no cost to any
11 candidate, if the difference between the highest number of votes cast for a
12 candidate for the office and the next highest number of votes cast for a candidate
13 for the office is 0.25 percent or less. Such a recount is not required to be conducted
14 if the format of the ballot allowed a voter to select more than one candidate for the
15 office, unless the difference between the number of votes cast in the election for the
-
*AB287_R1*

– 2 –
16 candidate with the lowest number of votes who won the election and the next
17 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less.
18 Existing law authorizes a voter at an election to demand and receive a recount
19 of the vote for a ballot question if the registered voter deposits the estimated costs
20 of the recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1: (1) instead authorizes a voter to demand
21 and receive a recount of the vote for a ballot question only if the difference between
22 the results of the ballot question being approved or disapproved is 5 percent or less;
23 and (2) additionally requires a recount of the vote for a ballot question to be
24 conducted if the difference between the results of the ballot question being
25 approved or disapproved is 0.25 percent or less.
26 Sections 2-5 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the changes to
27 the recount process made pursuant to section 1.
28 Existing law: (1) requires, under certain circumstances, the State Board of
29 Examiners to repay the allowable costs from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
30 Account to each county for a recount that concerns an office or ballot question for
31 which voting is statewide; and (2) sets forth a process for the review, submission
32 and approval of such costs. (NRS 293.405) If a recount of the vote for an office or
33 ballot question for which voting is statewide is required pursuant to section 1,
34 rather than demanded, section 3 requires: (1) the clerk of each county to submit a
35 statement of its costs in the recount to the Secretary of State for review and
36 approval; (2) the Secretary of State to submit such statements to the State Board of
37 Examiners; and (3) the State Board of Examiners to repay the allowable costs from
