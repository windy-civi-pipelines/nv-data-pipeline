EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising the circumstances under which a candidate
defeated at certain elections or a voter may demand a recount;
requiring, under certain circumstances, that a recount for certain
elections be conducted; requiring certain costs for certain recounts
to be repaid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a candidate defeated at certain
2 elections to demand and receive a recount of the vote for the office for which he or she is a
3 candidate if he or she deposits the estimated costs for the recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1 of
4 this bill instead: (1) authorizes a defeated candidate to demand a recount in certain elections if
5 the difference between the highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the
6 number of votes cast for the defeated candidate who demands the recount is 5 percent or less;
7 and (2) reorganizes the provisions of existing law that set forth how the estimated costs of the
8 recount are determined. Section 1 additionally requires, with certain exceptions, a recount of
9 the vote for an office to be conducted, at no cost to any candidate, if the difference between
10 the highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the next highest number of
11 votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less. Such a recount is not required
12 to be conducted if the format of the ballot allowed a voter to select more than one candidate
13 for the office, unless the difference between the number of votes cast in the election for the
14 candidate with the lowest number of votes who won the election and the next highest number
15 of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less.
16 Existing law authorizes a voter at an election to demand and receive a recount of the vote
17 for a ballot question if the registered voter deposits the estimated costs of the recount. (NRS
18 293.403) Section 1: (1) [eliminates the authority of] instead authorizes a voter to demand
19 and receive a recount of the vote for a ballot question [;] only if the difference between the
20 results of the ballot question being approved or disapproved is 5 percent or less; and (2)
21 [provides instead that] additionally requires a recount of the vote for a ballot question [must]
22 to be conducted if the difference between the results of the ballot question being approved or
23 disapproved is 0.25 percent or less. [Section 1 further provides that no voter is required to pay
24 the costs of such a recount.]

Assembly Amendment No. 99 to Assembly Bill No. 287 Page 4
25 Sections 2-5 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the changes to the
26 recount process made pursuant to section 1.
27 Existing law: (1) requires, under certain circumstances, the State Board of
28 Examiners to repay the allowable costs from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
29 Account to each county for a recount that concerns an office or ballot question for which
30 voting is statewide; and (2) sets forth a process for the review, submission and approval
31 of such costs. If a recount of the vote for an office or ballot question for which voting is
32 statewide is required pursuant to section 1, rather than demanded, section 3 requires:
33 (1) the clerk of each county to submit a statement of its costs in the recount to the
34 Secretary of State for review and approval; (2) the Secretary of State to submit such
35 statements to the State Board of Examiners; and (3) the State Board of Examiners to
36 repay the allowable costs from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account to the
37 respective counties.
