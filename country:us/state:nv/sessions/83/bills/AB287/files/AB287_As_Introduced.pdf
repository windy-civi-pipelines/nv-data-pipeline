EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising the circumstances under
which a candidate defeated at certain elections may
demand a recount; requiring, under certain circumstances,
that a recount for certain elections be conducted; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a candidate defeated at
2 certain elections to demand and receive a recount of the vote for the office for
3 which he or she is a candidate if he or she deposits the estimated costs for the
4 recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1 of this bill instead: (1) authorizes a defeated
5 candidate to demand a recount in certain elections if the difference between the
6 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the number of votes
7 cast for the defeated candidate who demands the recount is 5 percent or less; and
8 (2) reorganizes the provisions of existing law that set forth how the estimated costs
9 of the recount are determined. Section 1 additionally requires, with certain
10 exceptions, a recount of the vote for an office to be conducted, at no cost to any
11 candidate, if the difference between the highest number of votes cast for a
12 candidate for the office and the next highest number of votes cast for a candidate
13 for the office is 0.25 percent or less. Such a recount is not required to be conducted
14 if the format of the ballot allowed a voter to select more than one candidate for the
15 office, unless the difference between the number of votes cast in the election for the
16 candidate with the lowest number of votes who won the election and the next
17 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less.
18 Existing law authorizes a voter at an election to demand and receive a recount
19 of the vote for a ballot question if the registered voter deposits the estimated costs
20 of the recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1: (1) eliminates the authority of a voter to

– 2 –
21 demand and receive a recount of the vote for a ballot question; and (2) provides
22 instead that a recount of the vote for a ballot question must be conducted if the
23 difference between the results of the ballot question being approved or disapproved
24 is 0.25 percent or less. Section 1 further provides that no voter is required to pay
25 the costs of such a recount.
26 Sections 2-5 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the changes to
27 the recount process made pursuant to section 1.
