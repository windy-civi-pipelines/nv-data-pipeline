EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising the circumstances under which a candidate
defeated at certain elections may demand a recount; requiring, under
certain circumstances, that a recount for certain elections be conducted;
creating the Voter Access Grant Program and the Account for the
Voter Access Grant Program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a candidate defeated at certain
2 elections to demand and receive a recount of the vote for the office for which he or she is a
3 candidate if he or she deposits the estimated costs for the recount. (NRS 293.403) Section 1 of
4 this bill instead: (1) authorizes a defeated candidate to demand a recount in certain elections if
5 the difference between the highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the
6 number of votes cast for the defeated candidate who demands the recount is 5 percent or less;
7 and (2) reorganizes the provisions of existing law that set forth how the estimated costs of the
8 recount are determined. Section 1 additionally requires, with certain exceptions, a recount of
9 the vote for an office to be conducted, at no cost to any candidate, if the difference between
10 the highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the next highest number of
11 votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less. Such a recount is not required
12 to be conducted if the format of the ballot allowed a voter to select more than one candidate
13 for the office, unless the difference between the number of votes cast in the election for the
14 candidate with the lowest number of votes who won the election and the next highest number
15 of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less.
16 Existing law authorizes a voter at an election to demand and receive a recount of the vote
17 for a ballot question if the registered voter deposits the estimated costs of the recount. (NRS
18 293.403) Section 1: (1) eliminates the authority of a voter to demand and receive a recount of
19 the vote for a ballot question; and (2) provides instead that a recount of the vote for a ballot
20 question must be conducted if the difference between the results of the ballot question being
21 approved or disapproved is 0.25 percent or less. Section 1 further provides that no voter is
22 required to pay the costs of such a recount.
23 Sections 2-5 of this bill make conforming changes to account for the changes to the
24 recount process made pursuant to section 1.

Assembly Amendment No. 123 to Assembly Bill No. 287 Page 4
25 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to serve as the Chief Officer of Elections
26 for this State and to be responsible for the execution and enforcement of the provisions
27 of the Nevada Revised Statutes and all other provisions of state and federal law relating
28 to elections. (NRS 293.124) Section 7 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to
29 establish and administer the Voter Access Grant Program to provide grants of money
30 from the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program created by section 8 of this bill to
31 eligible entities to support the administration of elections and improve voter access. For
32 the purpose of providing such grants, an “eligible entity” is defined by section 7 to mean
33 a county, city or tribal government.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

4 for which he or she is a candidate to determine the number of votes received for the
5 defeated candidate and the number of votes received for the person who won the
6 election if [, within] the difference between the highest number of votes cast for a
7 candidate for the office and the number of votes cast for the defeated candidate
8 who demands the recount is 5 percent or less. To demand such a recount, within
9 3 working days after the canvass of the vote and the certification by the county
10 clerk or city clerk of the abstract of votes, the defeated candidate who demands the

12 (a) [Files] File in writing a demand with the officer with whom the defeated
13 candidate filed his or her declaration of candidacy; and
14 (b) [Deposits] Deposit in advance the estimated costs of the recount with that

22 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office and the next highest
23 number of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less. A
24 recount of the votes for an office is not required pursuant to this subsection if the
25 format of the ballot allowed a voter to select more than one candidate for the
26 office, unless the difference between the number of votes cast in the election for
27 the candidate with the lowest number of votes who won the election and the next
28 highest number of votes cast for a candidate for the office is 0.25 percent or less.

30 this subsection.

32 working days] after the canvass of the vote and the certification by the county clerk
33 or city clerk of the abstract of votes, the [voter:
