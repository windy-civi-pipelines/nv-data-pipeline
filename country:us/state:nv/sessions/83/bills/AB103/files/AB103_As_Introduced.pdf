Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law creates a municipal corporation known as
2 a housing authority in each city, county and town in this State to provide various
3 types of housing services for persons of certain low income in the city, county or
4 town. (NRS 315.140-315.7813) Existing law authorizes the initial operation of such
5 a housing authority only when the governing body of the city, county or town
6 declares by resolution that there is a need for the housing authority to function in
7 the city, county or town. (NRS 315.320) Upon the adoption of such a resolution,
8 existing law requires the appointment of five persons to serve as commissioners of
9 the housing authority. (NRS 315.370) In a county whose population is 700,000 or
10 more (currently only Clark County), existing law authorizes two or more housing
11 authorities to form a regional housing authority, which is required to be governed
12 by nine appointed commissioners. (NRS 315.7805, 315.7809) Under existing law, a
13 housing authority is authorized to provide, by resolution, compensation for each
14 commissioner of $80 for each meeting attended, but imposes a monthly limit of
15 $240 on such compensation. (NRS 315.390) In lieu of this specified amount of
16 compensation, section 1 of this bill authorizes the housing authority to provide, by
17 resolution, an amount of compensation determined by the housing authority that
18 does not exceed $200 for each meeting attended. Section 1 also increases the
19 monthly limit on such compensation to $600.
20 Existing law also creates the Nevada Rural Housing Authority to provide
21 various types of housing services for persons of certain low and moderate income
22 in areas of this State which are not included within the corporate limits of a city or
23 town having a population of 150,000 or more or in other areas pursuant to a
24 contract. (NRS 315.961-315.99874) Existing law: (1) requires the appointment of
25 five persons to serve as commissioners of the Authority; and (2) entitles each
26 commissioner to receive compensation of $80 per day for attendance at meetings of
27 the Authority. (NRS 315.977, 315.980) In lieu of this specified amount of
