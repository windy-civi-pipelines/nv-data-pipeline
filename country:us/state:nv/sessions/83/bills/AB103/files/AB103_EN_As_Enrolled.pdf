CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to housing authorities; authorizing the formation
of a regional housing authority in certain counties; setting
forth the composition and powers of certain regional housing
authorities; revising various provisions relating to housing
authorities; revising the compensation of commissioners; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
With certain exceptions, existing law creates a municipal corporation known as
a housing authority in each city, county and town in this State to provide various
types of housing services for persons of certain low income in the city, county or
town. (NRS 315.140-315.7813) Existing law authorizes the initial operation of such
a housing authority only when the governing body of the city, county or town
declares by resolution that there is a need for the housing authority to function in
the city, county or town. (NRS 315.320) Upon the adoption of such a resolution,
existing law requires the appointment of five persons to serve as commissioners of
the housing authority. (NRS 315.370) In a county whose population is 700,000 or
more (currently only Clark County), existing law authorizes two or more housing
authorities to form a regional housing authority, which is required to be governed
by nine appointed commissioners. (NRS 315.7805, 315.7809)
Section 3 of this bill authorizes the creation of a regional housing authority in a
county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only
Washoe County) by the governing body of each city, town and county located
within the county that desires to participate in the regional housing authority.
Section 3 requires dissolution of the existing housing authority upon formation of
the regional housing authority. Section 4 of this bill establishes the composition of
the regional housing authority and requires the appointment of seven
commissioners as follows: (1) two persons appointed by the governing body of the
county; (2) two persons appointed by the governing body of the largest city; (3) two
persons appointed by the governing body of the second largest city; and (4) one
person who must be a current recipient of assistance from the housing authority
appointed by the executive director of the regional housing authority.
Existing law sets forth that a housing authority is required to fix the rentals or
payments of its housing projects at low rates sufficient for certain purposes and is
prohibited from operating for a profit. (NRS 315.500) Section 18 of this bill also
authorizes a housing authority to fix the rentals or payments for the purposes of
enhancing the ability of the authority to meet its purposes, including providing
housing and services for low-income households in the operation area of the
authority. Section 18 provides that: (1) certain housing projects constructed or
operated that are eligible for low-income housing under certain federal laws are not
constructed or operated for a profit; and (2) the provisions do not prohibit
authorized actions or impose restrictions on a business entity created by section 5
of this bill. Section 18 also exempts a regional housing authority formed pursuant
to section 3 from operating for a profit.
Existing law requires a housing authority to follow certain conditions when
operating or managing a housing project, including renting or leasing a dwelling or
accommodation to eligible tenants subject to certain preferences and prohibiting a
housing authority from accepting any person as a tenant in a housing project who
-

exceeds certain income limitations. (NRS 315.510) Section 19 of this bill revises
the preferences to only include preferences that may be required by the Federal
Government pursuant to federal law or in any contract for financial assistance with
the authority and eliminates the certain income limitations. Section 19 also clarifies
that the provisions do not apply to a business entity created by section 5.
Existing law exempts from property taxes the portion of real property that is
used for housing and related facilities for persons with low incomes if the portion
of the property: (1) qualifies as a low-income unit that is part of a qualified low-
income housing project and is financed in part by certain federal or state funding
sources; or (2) meets certain affordability requirements set forth in federal law and
is financed in part by certain federal funding sources. (NRS 361.082) Existing law
requires a housing authority to pay in lieu of taxes to the State or any political
subdivision an amount consistent with the maintenance of the low-rent character of
the housing project or the achievement of the purposes of the housing authority.
(NRS 315.540) Section 20 of this bill provides that a housing authority is exempt
from such payments in lieu of taxes if the property meets the requirements for the
tax exemption.
Existing law defines the terms “veteran” and “serviceman or servicewoman”
related to housing authorities. (NRS 315.300) Section 2 of this bill moves and
revises the terms “serviceman” and “servicewoman” for the purposes of existing
law governing housing authorities. Section 12 of this bill revises the term “veteran”
for the purposes of existing law governing housing authorities.
Under existing law, a housing authority is authorized to provide, by resolution,
compensation for each commissioner of $80 for each meeting attended, but
imposes a monthly limit of $240 on such compensation. (NRS 315.390) In lieu of
this specified amount of compensation, section 14 of this bill authorizes the
housing authority to provide, by resolution, an amount of compensation determined
by the housing authority that does not exceed $250 for each meeting attended.
Section 14 also eliminates the monthly limit on such compensation.
Existing law also creates the Nevada Rural Housing Authority to provide
various types of housing services for persons of certain low and moderate income
in areas of this State which are not included within the corporate limits of a city or
town having a population of 150,000 or more or in other areas pursuant to a
contract. (NRS 315.961-315.99874) Existing law: (1) requires the appointment of
five persons to serve as commissioners of the Authority; and (2) entitles each
commissioner to receive compensation of $80 per day for attendance at meetings of
the Authority. (NRS 315.977, 315.980) In lieu of this specified amount of
compensation, section 22 of this bill requires the Authority to determine the
compensation for such attendance in an amount that does not exceed $250 per day.
Section 5 of this bill establishes, in addition to the various types of housing
services for persons of certain low income that a housing authority may provide,
certain powers of the regional housing authority, including authorizing the regional
housing authority to enter into a public-private partnership to finance a housing
project, construct or operate a housing project for profit and create a nonprofit or
for-profit business for the purpose of developing housing projects. Sections 5 and
22 of this bill exempt a business entity created by the regional housing authority
from the provisions that require that meetings of state and local agencies be open
and public.
Sections 6, 10, 11, 13 and 16 of this bill revise references to a regional housing
authority in existing law to include a regional authority formed pursuant to
section 3.
Section 8 of this bill indicates the placement of sections 2-5 in existing law
relating to housing authorities.

and effectuate the purposes and provisions of existing law relating to housing
authorities includes the provisions of sections 2-5.
