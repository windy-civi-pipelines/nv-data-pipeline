Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law creates a municipal corporation known as
2 a housing authority in each city, county and town in this State to provide various
3 types of housing services for persons of certain low income in the city, county or
4 town. (NRS 315.140-315.7813) Existing law authorizes the initial operation of such
5 a housing authority only when the governing body of the city, county or town
6 declares by resolution that there is a need for the housing authority to function in
7 the city, county or town. (NRS 315.320) Upon the adoption of such a resolution,
8 existing law requires the appointment of five persons to serve as commissioners of
9 the housing authority. (NRS 315.370) In a county whose population is 700,000 or
10 more (currently only Clark County), existing law authorizes two or more housing
11 authorities to form a regional housing authority, which is required to be governed
12 by nine appointed commissioners. (NRS 315.7805, 315.7809)
13 Section 3 of this bill authorizes the creation of a regional housing authority in a
14 county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only
15 Washoe County) by the governing body of each city, town and county located
16 within the county that desires to participate in the regional housing authority.
17 Section 3 requires dissolution of the existing housing authority upon formation of
18 the regional housing authority. Section 4 of this bill establishes the composition of
19 the regional housing authority and requires the appointment of seven
20 commissioners as follows: (1) two persons appointed by the governing body of the
-
*AB103_R1*

– 2 –
21 county; (2) two persons appointed by the governing body of the largest city; (3) two
22 persons appointed by the governing body of the second largest city; and (4) one
23 person who must be a current recipient of assistance from the housing authority
24 appointed by the executive director of the regional housing authority.
25 Existing law sets forth that a housing authority is required to fix the rentals or
26 payments of its housing projects at low rates sufficient for certain purposes and is
27 prohibited from operating for a profit. (NRS 315.500) Section 18 of this bill also
28 authorizes a housing authority to fix the rentals or payments for the purposes of
29 enhancing the ability of the authority to meet its purposes, including providing
30 housing and services for low-income households in the operation area of the
31 authority. Section 18 provides that: (1) certain housing projects constructed or
32 operated that are eligible for low-income housing under certain federal laws are not
33 constructed or operated for a profit; and (2) the provisions do not prohibit
34 authorized actions or impose restrictions on a business entity created by section 5
35 of this bill. Section 18 also exempts a regional housing authority formed pursuant
36 to section 3 from operating for a profit.
37 Existing law requires a housing authority to follow certain conditions when
38 operating or managing a housing project, including renting or leasing a dwelling or
39 accommodation to eligible tenants subject to certain preferences and prohibiting a
40 housing authority from accepting any person as a tenant in a housing project who
41 exceeds certain income limitations. (NRS 315.510) Section 19 of this bill revises
42 the preferences to only include preferences that may be required by the Federal
43 Government pursuant to federal law or in any contract for financial assistance with
44 the authority and eliminates the certain income limitations. Section 19 also clarifies
45 that the provisions do not apply to a business entity created by section 5.
46 Existing law exempts from property taxes the portion of real property that is
47 used for housing and related facilities for persons with low incomes if the portion
48 of the property: (1) qualifies as a low-income unit that is part of a qualified low-
49 income housing project and is financed in part by certain federal or state funding
50 sources; or (2) meets certain affordability requirements set forth in federal law and
51 is financed in part by certain federal funding sources. (NRS 361.082) Existing law
52 requires a housing authority to pay in lieu of taxes to the State or any political
53 subdivision an amount consistent with the maintenance of the low-rent character of
54 the housing project or the achievement of the purposes of the housing authority.
55 (NRS 315.540) Section 20 of this bill provides that a housing authority is exempt
56 from such payments in lieu of taxes if the property meets the requirements for the
57 tax exemption.
58 Existing law defines the terms “veteran” and “serviceman or servicewoman”
59 related to housing authorities. (NRS 315.300) Section 2 of this bill moves and
60 revises the terms “serviceman” and “servicewoman” for the purposes of existing
61 law governing housing authorities. Section 12 of this bill revises the term “veteran”
62 for the purposes of existing law governing housing authorities.
63 Under existing law, a housing authority is authorized to provide, by resolution,
64 compensation for each commissioner of $80 for each meeting attended, but
65 imposes a monthly limit of $240 on such compensation. (NRS 315.390) In lieu of
66 this specified amount of compensation, section 14 of this bill authorizes the
67 housing authority to provide, by resolution, an amount of compensation determined
68 by the housing authority that does not exceed $250 for each meeting attended.
69 Section 14 also eliminates the monthly limit on such compensation.
70 Existing law also creates the Nevada Rural Housing Authority to provide
71 various types of housing services for persons of certain low and moderate income
72 in areas of this State which are not included within the corporate limits of a city or
73 town having a population of 150,000 or more or in other areas pursuant to a
74 contract. (NRS 315.961-315.99874) Existing law: (1) requires the appointment of
75 five persons to serve as commissioners of the Authority; and (2) entitles each
-
*AB103_R1*

– 3 –
76 commissioner to receive compensation of $80 per day for attendance at meetings of
77 the Authority. (NRS 315.977, 315.980) In lieu of this specified amount of
78 compensation, section 22 of this bill requires the Authority to determine the
79 compensation for such attendance in an amount that does not exceed $250 per day.
80 Section 5 of this bill establishes, in addition to the various types of housing
81 services for persons of certain low income that a housing authority may provide,
82 certain powers of the regional housing authority, including authorizing the regional
83 housing authority to enter into a public-private partnership to finance a housing
84 project, construct or operate a housing project for profit and create a nonprofit or
85 for-profit business for the purpose of developing housing projects. Sections 5 and
86 22 of this bill exempt a business entity created by the regional housing authority
87 from the provisions that require that meetings of state and local agencies be open
88 and public.
89 Sections 6, 10, 11, 13 and 16 of this bill revise references to a regional housing
90 authority in existing law to include a regional authority formed pursuant to
91 section 3.
92 Section 8 of this bill indicates the placement of sections 2-5 in existing law
93 relating to housing authorities.
94 Section 9 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 2 to the
95 provisions of sections 2-5.
96 Section 15 of this bill indicates the powers of a housing authority to carry out
97 and effectuate the purposes and provisions of existing law relating to housing
98 authorities includes the provisions of sections 2-5.
99 Section 25 of this bill repeals obsolete provisions relating to the provision of
100 housing by a housing authority. Section 7 of this bill makes conforming changes to
101 eliminate references to the repealed provisions.

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
315.011 Legislative findings and declarations. The
Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
1. The policy of this State, to provide decent, safe and sanitary
housing for persons of low income, is being thwarted by the
frequent occurrence in public housing of activities concerning the
unlawful possession, distribution and use of controlled substances.
2. The provision of public housing has never been intended to
help subsidize criminal behavior.
3. These unlawful activities, conducted by an intimidating
minority of the residents of public housing, are causing our public
-
*AB103_R1*

– 14 –
housing to become increasingly infested with violence, degeneracy
and squalor, which imperils the physical and mental health of the
peaceful residents therein.
4. Persons residing with the active participants in these
unlawful activities commonly share in the proceeds thereof or have
the ability to prevent or interfere significantly in the conduct of the
activities.
5. It will promote the public health, safety and welfare of the
residents of this State to require housing authorities to evict from
public housing both the persons who actively participate in unlawful
activities relating to the possession, distribution or use of controlled
substances, and the persons who reside with them.
315.580 Housing for veterans and servicemen or
servicewomen.
1. In addition to other powers conferred upon an authority by
NRS 315.140 to 315.7813, inclusive, an authority may acquire
property and construct housing projects thereon for the purpose of
leasing dwellings to servicemen or servicewomen, veterans and their
families, and the families of deceased persons who served in the
Armed Forces, at rentals, excluding utilities, of not to exceed $50
per month, during the existence of the acute shortage of housing
available to such persons as determined by applicable law or as may
be provided for in any contract for financial assistance with the
Federal Government.
2. In exercising the powers provided in this section an
authority shall not be subject to the limitations provided in NRS
315.500 or 315.510 during the period of acute housing shortage for
veterans and servicemen or servicewomen, and their families and
the families of deceased persons who served in the Armed Forces,
of moderate income.
