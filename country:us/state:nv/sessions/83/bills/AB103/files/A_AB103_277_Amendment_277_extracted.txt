housing authority in certain counties; setting forth the composition
and powers of certain regional housing authorities; revising
various provisions relating to housing authorities; revising the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law creates a municipal corporation known as a housing
2 authority in each city, county and town in this State to provide various types of housing
3 services for persons of certain low income in the city, county or town. (NRS 315.140-
4 315.7813) Existing law authorizes the initial operation of such a housing authority only when
5 the governing body of the city, county or town declares by resolution that there is a need for
6 the housing authority to function in the city, county or town. (NRS 315.320) Upon the
7 adoption of such a resolution, existing law requires the appointment of five persons to serve as
8 commissioners of the housing authority. (NRS 315.370) In a county whose population is
9 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), existing law authorizes two or more housing
10 authorities to form a regional housing authority, which is required to be governed by nine
11 appointed commissioners. (NRS 315.7805, 315.7809)
12 Section 3 of this bill authorizes the creation of a regional housing authority in a
13 county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only
14 Washoe County) by the governing body of each city, town and county located within the
15 county that desires to participate in the regional housing authority. Section 3 requires
16 dissolution of the existing housing authority upon formation of the regional housing
17 authority. Section 4 of this bill establishes the composition of the regional housing
18 authority and requires the appointment of seven commissioners as follows: (1) two
19 persons appointed by the governing body of the county; (2) two persons appointed by
20 the governing body of the largest city; (3) two persons appointed by the governing body
21 of the second largest city; and (4) one person who must be a current recipient of
22 assistance from the housing authority appointed by the executive director of the regional
23 housing authority.
24 Existing law sets forth that a housing authority is required to fix the rentals or
25 payments of its housing projects at low rates sufficient for certain purposes and is
26 prohibited from operating for a profit. (NRS 315.500) Section 18 of this bill also
27 authorizes a housing authority to fix the rentals or payments for the purposes of
Assembly Amendment No. 277 to Assembly Bill No. 103 Page 4
28 enhancing the ability of the authority to meet its purposes, including providing housing
29 and services for low-income households in the operation area of the authority. Section 18
30 provides that: (1) certain housing projects constructed or operated that are eligible for
31 low-income housing under certain federal laws are not constructed or operated for a
32 profit; and (2) the provisions do not prohibit authorized actions or impose restrictions
33 on a business entity created by section 5 of this bill. Section 18 also exempts a regional
34 housing authority formed pursuant to section 3 from operating for a profit.
35 Existing law requires a housing authority to follow certain conditions when
36 operating or managing a housing project, including renting or leasing a dwelling or
37 accommodation to eligible tenants subject to certain preferences and prohibiting a
38 housing authority from accepting any person as a tenant in a housing project who
39 exceeds certain income limitations. (NRS 315.510) Section 19 of this bill revises the
40 preferences to only include preferences that may be required by the Federal
41 Government pursuant to federal law or in any contract for financial assistance with the
42 authority and eliminates the certain income limitations. Section 19 also clarifies that the
43 provisions do not apply to a business entity created by section 5.
44 Existing law exempts from property taxes the portion of real property that is used
45 for housing and related facilities for persons with low incomes if the portion of the
46 property: (1) qualifies as a low-income unit that is part of a qualified low-income
47 housing project and is financed in part by certain federal or state funding sources; or (2)
48 meets certain affordability requirements set forth in federal law and is financed in part
49 by certain federal funding sources. (NRS 361.082) Existing law requires a housing
50 authority to pay in lieu of taxes to the State or any political subdivision an amount
51 consistent with the maintenance of the low-rent character of the housing project or the
52 achievement of the purposes of the housing authority. (NRS 315.540) Section 20 of this
53 bill provides that a housing authority is exempt from such payments in lieu of taxes if
54 the property meets the requirements for the tax exemption.
55 Existing law defines the terms “veteran” and “serviceman or servicewoman” related
56 to housing authorities. (NRS 315.300) Section 2 of this bill moves and revises the terms
57 “serviceman” and “servicewoman” for the purposes of existing law governing housing
58 authorities. Section 12 of this bill revises the term “veteran” for the purposes of existing
59 law governing housing authorities.
60 Under existing law, a housing authority is authorized to provide, by resolution,
61 compensation for each commissioner of $80 for each meeting attended, but imposes a
62 monthly limit of $240 on such compensation. (NRS 315.390) In lieu of this specified amount
63 of compensation, section [1] 14 of this bill authorizes the housing authority to provide, by
64 resolution, an amount of compensation determined by the housing authority that does not
65 exceed [$200] $250 for each meeting attended. Section [1] 14 also [increases] eliminates the
66 monthly limit on such compensation . [to $600.]
67 Existing law also creates the Nevada Rural Housing Authority to provide various types of
68 housing services for persons of certain low and moderate income in areas of this State which
69 are not included within the corporate limits of a city or town having a population of 150,000
70 or more or in other areas pursuant to a contract. (NRS 315.961-315.99874) Existing law: (1)
71 requires the appointment of five persons to serve as commissioners of the Authority; and (2)
72 entitles each commissioner to receive compensation of $80 per day for attendance at meetings
73 of the Authority. (NRS 315.977, 315.980) In lieu of this specified amount of compensation,
74 section [2] 22 of this bill requires the Authority to determine the compensation for such
75 attendance in an amount that does not exceed [$200] $250 per day.
76 Section 5 of this bill establishes, in addition to the various types of housing services
77 for persons of certain low income that a housing authority may provide, certain powers
78 of the regional housing authority, including authorizing the regional housing authority
79 to enter into a public-private partnership to finance a housing project, construct or
80 operate a housing project for profit and create a nonprofit or for-profit business for the
81 purpose of developing housing projects. Sections 5 and 22 of this bill exempt a business
82 entity created by the regional housing authority from the provisions that require that
83 meetings of state and local agencies be open and public.
84 Sections 6, 10, 11, 13 and 16 of this bill revise references to a regional housing
85 authority in existing law to include a regional authority formed pursuant to section 3.
Assembly Amendment No. 277 to Assembly Bill No. 103 Page 5
86 Section 8 of this bill indicates the placement of sections 2-5 in existing law relating to
87 housing authorities.
88 Section 9 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 2 to the
89 provisions of sections 2-5.
90 Section 15 of this bill indicates the powers of a housing authority to carry out and
91 effectuate the purposes and provisions of existing law relating to housing authorities
92 includes the provisions of sections 2-5.
93 Section 25 of this bill repeals obsolete provisions relating to the provision of housing
94 by a housing authority. Section 7 of this bill makes conforming changes to eliminate
95 references to the repealed provisions.

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS

Section 2:
315.011 Legislative findings and declarations. The Legislature hereby
finds and declares that:

Section 3:
1. The policy of this State, to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing
for persons of low income, is being thwarted by the frequent occurrence in
public housing of activities concerning the unlawful possession, distribution
and use of controlled substances.

Section 4:
2. The provision of public housing has never been intended to help
subsidize criminal behavior.

Section 5:
3. These unlawful activities, conducted by an intimidating minority of the
residents of public housing, are causing our public housing to become
increasingly infested with violence, degeneracy and squalor, which imperils the
physical and mental health of the peaceful residents therein.

Section 6:
4. Persons residing with the active participants in these unlawful
activities commonly share in the proceeds thereof or have the ability to prevent
or interfere significantly in the conduct of the activities.

Section 7:
5. It will promote the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of
this State to require housing authorities to evict from public housing both the
persons who actively participate in unlawful activities relating to the
possession, distribution or use of controlled substances, and the persons who
reside with them.

utilities, of not to exceed $50 per month, during the existence of the acute
shortage of housing available to such persons as determined by applicable law
or as may be provided for in any contract for financial assistance with the
Federal Government.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing authorities; authorizing the formation of a regional
housing authority in certain counties; setting forth the composition
and powers of certain regional housing authorities; revising
various provisions relating to housing authorities; revising the
compensation of commissioners; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law creates a municipal corporation known as a housing
2 authority in each city, county and town in this State to provide various types of housing
3 services for persons of certain low income in the city, county or town. (NRS 315.140-
4 315.7813) Existing law authorizes the initial operation of such a housing authority only when
5 the governing body of the city, county or town declares by resolution that there is a need for
6 the housing authority to function in the city, county or town. (NRS 315.320) Upon the
7 adoption of such a resolution, existing law requires the appointment of five persons to serve as
8 commissioners of the housing authority. (NRS 315.370) In a county whose population is
9 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), existing law authorizes two or more housing
10 authorities to form a regional housing authority, which is required to be governed by nine
11 appointed commissioners. (NRS 315.7805, 315.7809)
12 Section 3 of this bill authorizes the creation of a regional housing authority in a
13 county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only
14 Washoe County) by the governing body of each city, town and county located within the
15 county that desires to participate in the regional housing authority. Section 3 requires
16 dissolution of the existing housing authority upon formation of the regional housing
17 authority. Section 4 of this bill establishes the composition of the regional housing
18 authority and requires the appointment of seven commissioners as follows: (1) two
19 persons appointed by the governing body of the county; (2) two persons appointed by
20 the governing body of the largest city; (3) two persons appointed by the governing body
21 of the second largest city; and (4) one person who must be a current recipient of
22 assistance from the housing authority appointed by the executive director of the regional
23 housing authority.
24 Existing law sets forth that a housing authority is required to fix the rentals or
25 payments of its housing projects at low rates sufficient for certain purposes and is
26 prohibited from operating for a profit. (NRS 315.500) Section 18 of this bill also
27 authorizes a housing authority to fix the rentals or payments for the purposes of

Assembly Amendment No. 277 to Assembly Bill No. 103 Page 4
28 enhancing the ability of the authority to meet its purposes, including providing housing
29 and services for low-income households in the operation area of the authority. Section 18
30 provides that: (1) certain housing projects constructed or operated that are eligible for
31 low-income housing under certain federal laws are not constructed or operated for a
32 profit; and (2) the provisions do not prohibit authorized actions or impose restrictions
33 on a business entity created by section 5 of this bill. Section 18 also exempts a regional
34 housing authority formed pursuant to section 3 from operating for a profit.
35 Existing law requires a housing authority to follow certain conditions when
36 operating or managing a housing project, including renting or leasing a dwelling or
37 accommodation to eligible tenants subject to certain preferences and prohibiting a
38 housing authority from accepting any person as a tenant in a housing project who
39 exceeds certain income limitations. (NRS 315.510) Section 19 of this bill revises the
40 preferences to only include preferences that may be required by the Federal
41 Government pursuant to federal law or in any contract for financial assistance with the
42 authority and eliminates the certain income limitations. Section 19 also clarifies that the
43 provisions do not apply to a business entity created by section 5.
44 Existing law exempts from property taxes the portion of real property that is used
45 for housing and related facilities for persons with low incomes if the portion of the
46 property: (1) qualifies as a low-income unit that is part of a qualified low-income
47 housing project and is financed in part by certain federal or state funding sources; or (2)
48 meets certain affordability requirements set forth in federal law and is financed in part
49 by certain federal funding sources. (NRS 361.082) Existing law requires a housing
50 authority to pay in lieu of taxes to the State or any political subdivision an amount
51 consistent with the maintenance of the low-rent character of the housing project or the
52 achievement of the purposes of the housing authority. (NRS 315.540) Section 20 of this
53 bill provides that a housing authority is exempt from such payments in lieu of taxes if
54 the property meets the requirements for the tax exemption.
55 Existing law defines the terms “veteran” and “serviceman or servicewoman” related
56 to housing authorities. (NRS 315.300) Section 2 of this bill moves and revises the terms
57 “serviceman” and “servicewoman” for the purposes of existing law governing housing
58 authorities. Section 12 of this bill revises the term “veteran” for the purposes of existing
59 law governing housing authorities.
60 Under existing law, a housing authority is authorized to provide, by resolution,
61 compensation for each commissioner of $80 for each meeting attended, but imposes a
62 monthly limit of $240 on such compensation. (NRS 315.390) In lieu of this specified amount
63 of compensation, section [1] 14 of this bill authorizes the housing authority to provide, by
64 resolution, an amount of compensation determined by the housing authority that does not
65 exceed [$200] $250 for each meeting attended. Section [1] 14 also [increases] eliminates the
66 monthly limit on such compensation . [to $600.]
67 Existing law also creates the Nevada Rural Housing Authority to provide various types of
68 housing services for persons of certain low and moderate income in areas of this State which
69 are not included within the corporate limits of a city or town having a population of 150,000
70 or more or in other areas pursuant to a contract. (NRS 315.961-315.99874) Existing law: (1)
71 requires the appointment of five persons to serve as commissioners of the Authority; and (2)
72 entitles each commissioner to receive compensation of $80 per day for attendance at meetings
73 of the Authority. (NRS 315.977, 315.980) In lieu of this specified amount of compensation,
74 section [2] 22 of this bill requires the Authority to determine the compensation for such
75 attendance in an amount that does not exceed [$200] $250 per day.
76 Section 5 of this bill establishes, in addition to the various types of housing services
77 for persons of certain low income that a housing authority may provide, certain powers
78 of the regional housing authority, including authorizing the regional housing authority
79 to enter into a public-private partnership to finance a housing project, construct or
80 operate a housing project for profit and create a nonprofit or for-profit business for the
81 purpose of developing housing projects. Sections 5 and 22 of this bill exempt a business
82 entity created by the regional housing authority from the provisions that require that
83 meetings of state and local agencies be open and public.
84 Sections 6, 10, 11, 13 and 16 of this bill revise references to a regional housing
85 authority in existing law to include a regional authority formed pursuant to section 3.

Assembly Amendment No. 277 to Assembly Bill No. 103 Page 5
86 Section 8 of this bill indicates the placement of sections 2-5 in existing law relating to
87 housing authorities.
88 Section 9 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 2 to the

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
315.011 Legislative findings and declarations. The Legislature hereby
finds and declares that:
1. The policy of this State, to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing
for persons of low income, is being thwarted by the frequent occurrence in
public housing of activities concerning the unlawful possession, distribution
and use of controlled substances.
2. The provision of public housing has never been intended to help
subsidize criminal behavior.
3. These unlawful activities, conducted by an intimidating minority of the
residents of public housing, are causing our public housing to become
increasingly infested with violence, degeneracy and squalor, which imperils the
physical and mental health of the peaceful residents therein.
4. Persons residing with the active participants in these unlawful
activities commonly share in the proceeds thereof or have the ability to prevent
or interfere significantly in the conduct of the activities.
5. It will promote the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of
this State to require housing authorities to evict from public housing both the
persons who actively participate in unlawful activities relating to the
possession, distribution or use of controlled substances, and the persons who
reside with them.

Assembly Amendment No. 277 to Assembly Bill No. 103 Page 13

1. In addition to other powers conferred upon an authority by NRS
315.140 to 315.7813, inclusive, an authority may acquire property and
construct housing projects thereon for the purpose of leasing dwellings to
servicemen or servicewomen, veterans and their families, and the families of
deceased persons who served in the Armed Forces, at rentals, excluding
utilities, of not to exceed $50 per month, during the existence of the acute
shortage of housing available to such persons as determined by applicable law
or as may be provided for in any contract for financial assistance with the
Federal Government.
2. In exercising the powers provided in this section an authority shall not
be subject to the limitations provided in NRS 315.500 or 315.510 during the
period of acute housing shortage for veterans and servicemen or
servicewomen, and their families and the families of deceased persons who
served in the Armed Forces, of moderate income.
