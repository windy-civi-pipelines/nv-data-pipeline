Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes special license plates and registration certificates to be
2 issued to residents of Nevada for antique motor vehicles that qualify as “Old
3 Timer” vehicles, street rods, classic rods or classic vehicles. (NRS 482.381,
4 482.3812, 482.3814, 482.3816) Section 1 of this bill also authorizes the
5 Department of Motor Vehicles to issue special license plates and registration
6 certificates to residents for antique kei vehicles, which are defined as imported
7 vehicles having an enclosed passenger cab that are: (1) at least 25 years old; (2)
8 powered by an internal combustion engine with a displacement of 660 cubic
9 centimeter or less; (3) 60 inches or less in width; (4) 135 inches or less in length;
10 and (5) designed to travel on four wheels. Section 1 prohibits the use of a vehicle
11 which has been issued special license plates and a registration certificate for antique
12 kei vehicles from being used for general transportation purposes but authorizes
13 such a vehicle to be used for club activities, exhibitions, tours, parades or similar
14 activities and for uses which are necessary for the operation and maintenance of the
15 vehicle. Section 1 authorizes a person wishing to obtain the special license plates to

16 request that the plates be combined with personalized prestige plates if the person
17 pays the additional fees for the personalized prestige plates.
18 Existing law requires the State Environmental Commission, in cooperation with
19 the Department and any local air pollution control agency, to adopt regulations for
20 the control of emissions from motor vehicles in areas designated by the
21 Commission that are in any county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
22 Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 445B.770) Existing law also authorizes the
23 Commission to prescribe emissions standards for certain vehicles but requires the
24 Commission to provide an exemption for certain classic vehicles that the owner
25 certifies were not driven more than 5,000 miles during the immediately preceding
26 year. (NRS 445B.760) Section 7 of this bill similarly exempts an antique kei
27 vehicle from such exhaust emissions standards if the owner of the antique kei
28 vehicle certifies to the Department that the antique kei vehicle was not driven more
29 than 5,000 miles during the immediately preceding year. Section 1 exempts an
30 antique kei vehicle from certain standards and requirements for the control of
31 emissions. Section 3 of this bill prohibits the Department from issuing a special
32 license plate pursuant to section 1 if the motor vehicle is tested for exhaust
33 emissions and fails such an emissions test.
34 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a new vehicle dealer who is authorized to issue
35 certificates of registration from accepting an application for the registration of an
36 antique kei vehicle if the applicant wishes to obtain special license plates.
37 Section 4 of this bill prohibits the Department from issuing the special license
38 plate for a full trailer or semitrailer.
39 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the holder of the
40 original registration of any antique kei vehicle to transfer the registration and use of
41 the special license plates to another vehicle under certain circumstances.
42 Section 6 of this bill establishes a fee of $10 for any replacement of a special
43 license plate issued pursuant to section 1.
