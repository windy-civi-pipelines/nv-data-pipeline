AN ACT relating to the education of incarcerated persons; requiring
staff at each institution or facility of the Department of
Corrections to provide information and assistance relating
to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid; requiring
the submission of certain reports concerning the provision
of such information and assistance; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the board of trustees of a school district and the governing
2 bodies of certain charter schools and private schools are required to provide support
3 and assistance to certain pupils and their parents or legal guardians in completing
4 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and report certain related
5 information to the State Treasurer. (NRS 388.224, 394.151) Section 2.3 of this bill
6 imposes similar requirements on the programming staff at each institution or
7 facility of the Department of Corrections. Section 2.3 requires such staff to: (1)
8 provide information to offenders on the importance and benefits of financial
9 planning and completing the FAFSA; and (2) offer assistance to offenders in
10 completing the FAFSA, including through designated FAFSA events held each
11 year in October and February. Section 2.3 also requires: (1) each institution and
12 facility to report annually to the Department on the implementation and outcomes
13 of such services; and (2) the Department to submit a summary of such reports to the
14 Joint Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary in odd-numbered years. Section
15 2.3 prohibits the Department and Department staff from using the decision of an
16 offender to apply for financial aid or to participate in related activities as the basis
17 for imposing a sanction or granting a privilege, incentive or other benefit. Finally,
18 section 2.3 provides that any substantially similar program offered by the
19 Department in effect on July 1, 2025, is deemed to satisfy such requirements if the
20 Department continues to offer the program without substantial interruption.
