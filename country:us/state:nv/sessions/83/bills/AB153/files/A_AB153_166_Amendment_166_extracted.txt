AN ACT relating to the education of incarcerated persons; requiring [a school
district that operates a program] staff at each institution or facility of
[education for incarcerated persons] the Department of Corrections
to provide [support] information and assistance relating to [certain
incarcerated persons in completing] the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid; requiring the [board of trustees] submission of [a school
district that operates a program] certain reports concerning the
provision of [education for incarcerated persons to report certain] such
information [to the State Treasurer;] and assistance; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law provides for the establishment of a statewide program of education for
2 incarcerated persons and sets forth certain requirements for the program. (NRS 388H.020) To
3 carry out the statewide program of education for incarcerated persons, existing law authorizes
4 the board of trustees of a school district to operate a program of education for incarcerated
5 persons in any facility or institution operated by the Department of Corrections in the county
6 of the school district. (NRS 388H.040)]
7 Under existing law, the board of trustees of a school district and the governing bodies of
8 certain charter schools and private schools are required to [: (1)] provide support and
9 assistance to certain pupils and their parents or legal guardians in completing the Free
10 Application for Federal Student Aid [;] (FAFSA) and [(2)] report certain related
11 information to the State Treasurer . [certain information relating to the provision of such
12 support and assistance.] (NRS 388.224, 394.151) Section [1] 2.3 of this bill imposes similar
13 requirements on [a school district that operates a program] the programming staff at each
14 institution or facility of [education for incarcerated persons.] the Department of
15 Corrections. Section 2.3 requires such staff to: (1) provide information to offenders on
16 the importance and benefits of financial planning and completing the FAFSA; and (2)
17 offer assistance to offenders in completing the FAFSA, including through designated
18 FAFSA events held each year in October and February. Section 2.3 also requires: (1)
19 each institution and facility to report annually to the Department on the implementation
Assembly Amendment No. 166 to Assembly Bill No. 153 Page 4
20 and outcomes of such services; and (2) the Department to submit a summary of such
21 reports to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary in odd-numbered
22 years. Section 2.3 prohibits the Department and Department staff from using the
23 decision of an offender to apply for financial aid or to participate in related activities as
24 the basis for imposing a sanction or granting a privilege, incentive or other benefit.
25 Finally, section 2.3 provides that any substantially similar program offered by the
26 Department in effect on July 1, 2025, is deemed to satisfy such requirements if the
27 Department continues to offer the program without substantial interruption.
