EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program;
requiring the Board of the Public Employees’ Benefits
Program to report certain information relating to the costs
of health insurance for certain retirees; revising provisions
relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and welfare
benefits for certain state employees who have retired with
state service; revising requirements for certain retired
public officers and employees to reinstate insurance under
the Program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay
2 for a portion of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public
3 Employees’ Benefits Program on behalf of persons who were initially hired before
4 January 1, 2012, and have retired with state service, which must be: (1) deposited in
5 the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund to pay a portion of the current
6 and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2) based upon a base
7 amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also requires that,
8 for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to the
9 Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for
10 persons who retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the
11 Legislature multiplied by 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1,
12 1994, the base funding level multiplied by the years of service of the person,
13 excluding service purchased, up to a maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section
14 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program to report, before August 31 of every
15 even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim Retirement and Benefits
-
*AB188*

– 2 –
16 Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to obtain
17 actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered
18 by the Program.
19 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE
20 program or Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 of this
21 bill prohibits the Board, unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1)
22 establishing limits on the yearly balance of such health reimbursement
23 arrangements; and (2) reverting money in a health reimbursement arrangement to
24 the Retirees’ Fund unless the retiree has died or, for more than 2 consecutive years,
25 elected coverage other than coverage provided through TRICARE, Medicare or the
26 plan offered by the Program.
27 Under existing law, persons hired on or after January 1, 2012, are ineligible to
28 receive a subsidy to pay a portion of their current and future health and welfare
29 benefits upon retirement. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 provides that persons hired on
30 and after January 1, 2012, are eligible to receive the subsidy from the Fund, subject
31 to the same adjustments and limitations as retirees who were initially hired on or
32 after January 1, 2010, which require, with certain exceptions, that the retiree must
33 have: (1) participated in the Program on a continuous basis since retirement; and (2)
34 15 years of service, which must include state service and may include local
35 governmental service.
36 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse
37 of a retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance
38 under the Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not
39 have more than one period during which the retired public officer or employee was
40 not covered by insurance under the Program on or after the later of October 1,
41 2011, or the date of retirement of the public officer or employee, and the officer or
42 employee retired from: (1) a participating state or local governmental agency under
43 certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement program established by the
44 Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional staff of the Nevada
45 System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local government agency,
46 under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance, the public
47 officer or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program
48 not later than 31 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475)
49 Section 4 of this bill: (1) removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or
50 employee not have more than one period during which he or she was not covered
51 by insurance under the Program to reinstate insurance; (2) authorizes the public
52 officer or employee or surviving spouse to reinstate coverage during any open
53 enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and (3) provides that the retired public
54 officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive the subsidy provided
55 for certain retired employees.
56 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the
57 Program to the provisions of section 1.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 287 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
