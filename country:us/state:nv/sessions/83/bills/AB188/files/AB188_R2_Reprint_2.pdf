EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program;
requiring the Board of the Public Employees’ Benefits
Program to report certain information relating to the costs
of health insurance for certain retirees; revising provisions
relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and welfare
benefits for certain state employees who have retired with
state service; revising requirements for certain retired
public officers and employees to reinstate insurance under
the Program; requiring the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Government Affairs to conduct an interim
study on the Program; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay
2 for a portion of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public
3 Employees’ Benefits Program on behalf of persons who were initially hired before
4 January 1, 2012, and have retired with state service, which must be: (1) deposited in
5 the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund to pay a portion of the current
6 and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2) based upon a base
7 amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also requires that,
8 for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to the
9 Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for
10 persons who retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the
11 Legislature multiplied by 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1,
12 1994, the base funding level multiplied by the years of service of the person,
13 excluding service purchased, up to a maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046)

14 Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program to report, before August 31
15 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim Retirement and
16 Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
17 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan
18 offered by the Program.
19 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE
20 program or Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 of this
21 bill prohibits the Board, unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1)
22 establishing limits on the yearly balance of a health reimbursement arrangement for
23 a person who is enrolled in Medicare that is less than the total amount of the
24 subsidy paid by the Board in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years; and (2)
25 reverting money in a health reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund
26 unless the retiree has died or, for more than 2 consecutive years, elected coverage
27 other than coverage provided through TRICARE, Medicare or the plan offered by
28 the Program.
29 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse
30 of a retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance
31 under the Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not
32 have more than one period during which the retired public officer or employee was
33 not covered by insurance under the Program on or after the later of October 1,
34 2011, or the date of retirement of the public officer or employee, and the officer or
35 employee retired from: (1) a participating state or local governmental agency under
36 certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement program established by the
37 Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional staff of the Nevada
38 System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local governmental agency,
39 under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance, the public
40 officer or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program
41 not later than 31 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475)
42 Section 4 of this bill: (1) removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or
43 employee not have more than one period during which he or she was not covered
44 by insurance under the Program to reinstate insurance; and (2) instead provides that
45 if a person has more than one period during which he or she was not covered by
46 insurance under the Program, the Board may require the person to provide evidence
47 of continuous coverage provided under another health insurance plan during any
48 period other than the first period in which he or she was not covered to reinstate
49 insurance under the Program.
50 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving
51 spouse to reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of
52 insurance; and (2) provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible,
53 upon reinstatement, to receive the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
54 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
55 Government Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning
56 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
57 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the
58 Program to the provisions of section 1.
