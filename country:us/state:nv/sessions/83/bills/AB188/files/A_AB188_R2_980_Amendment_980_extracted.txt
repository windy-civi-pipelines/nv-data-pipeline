EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; requiring the Board
of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to report certain
information relating to the costs of health insurance for certain retirees;
revising provisions relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and
welfare benefits for certain state employees who have retired with state
service; revising requirements for certain retired public officers and
employees to reinstate insurance under the Program; revising
provisions relating to certain subsidies paid to the Program for the
2025-2027 biennium; requiring the Joint Interim Standing Committee
on Government Affairs to conduct an interim study on the Program;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay for a portion
2 of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public Employees’ Benefits Program on
3 behalf of persons who were initially hired before January 1, 2012, and have retired with state
4 service, which must be: (1) deposited in the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund
5 to pay a portion of the current and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2)
6 based upon a base amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also
7 requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to
8 the Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for persons who
9 retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the Legislature multiplied by
10 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1, 1994, the base funding level
11 multiplied by the years of service of the person, excluding service purchased, up to a
12 maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program
13 to report, before August 31 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim
14 Retirement and Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
15 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered by
16 the Program.
Senate Amendment No. 980 to Assembly Bill No. 188 Second Reprint Page 4
17 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or
18 Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 of this bill prohibits the Board,
19 unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1) establishing limits on the yearly balance of
20 a health reimbursement arrangement for a person who is enrolled in Medicare that is less than
21 the total amount of the subsidy paid by the Board in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years;
22 and (2) reverting money in a health reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund unless
23 the retiree has died or, for more than 2 consecutive years, elected coverage other than
24 coverage provided through TRICARE, Medicare or the plan offered by the Program.
25 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse of a
26 retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance under the
27 Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not have more than one
28 period during which the retired public officer or employee was not covered by insurance
29 under the Program on or after the later of October 1, 2011, or the date of retirement of the
30 public officer or employee, and the officer or employee retired from: (1) a participating state
31 or local governmental agency under certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement
32 program established by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional
33 staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local governmental
34 agency, under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance, the public officer
35 or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program not later than 31
36 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
37 removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or employee not have more than one
38 period during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program to reinstate
39 insurance; and (2) instead provides that if a person has more than one period during which he
40 or she was not covered by insurance under the Program, the Board may require the person to
41 provide evidence of continuous coverage provided under another health insurance plan during
42 any period other than the first period in which he or she was not covered to reinstate insurance
43 under the Program.
44 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving spouse to
45 reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and (2)
46 provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive
47 the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
48 Existing law establishes for the 2025-2027 biennium the share of the cost of qualified
49 medical expenses for individual Medicare insurance plans through the Program that is
50 required to be paid by the State and local governments for retired public officers and
51 employees. (Chapter 57, Statutes of Nevada 2025) Section 4.1 of this bill increases those
52 amounts for Fiscal Year 2026-2027. Section 4.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to
53 pay for the increases.
54 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government
55 Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the Public Employees’
56 Benefits Program.
57 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the Program to
58 the provisions of section 1.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; requiring the Board
of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to report certain
information relating to the costs of health insurance for certain retirees;
revising provisions relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and
welfare benefits for certain state employees who have retired with state
service; revising requirements for certain retired public officers and
employees to reinstate insurance under the Program; revising
provisions relating to certain subsidies paid to the Program for the
2025-2027 biennium; requiring the Joint Interim Standing Committee
on Government Affairs to conduct an interim study on the Program;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay for a portion
2 of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public Employees’ Benefits Program on
3 behalf of persons who were initially hired before January 1, 2012, and have retired with state
4 service, which must be: (1) deposited in the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund
5 to pay a portion of the current and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2)
6 based upon a base amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also
7 requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to
8 the Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for persons who
9 retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the Legislature multiplied by
10 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1, 1994, the base funding level
11 multiplied by the years of service of the person, excluding service purchased, up to a
12 maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program
13 to report, before August 31 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim
14 Retirement and Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
15 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered by
16 the Program.

Senate Amendment No. 980 to Assembly Bill No. 188 Second Reprint Page 4
17 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or
18 Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 of this bill prohibits the Board,
19 unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1) establishing limits on the yearly balance of
20 a health reimbursement arrangement for a person who is enrolled in Medicare that is less than
21 the total amount of the subsidy paid by the Board in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years;
22 and (2) reverting money in a health reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund unless
23 the retiree has died or, for more than 2 consecutive years, elected coverage other than
24 coverage provided through TRICARE, Medicare or the plan offered by the Program.
25 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse of a
26 retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance under the
27 Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not have more than one
28 period during which the retired public officer or employee was not covered by insurance
29 under the Program on or after the later of October 1, 2011, or the date of retirement of the
30 public officer or employee, and the officer or employee retired from: (1) a participating state
31 or local governmental agency under certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement
32 program established by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional
33 staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local governmental
34 agency, under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance, the public officer
35 or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program not later than 31
36 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
37 removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or employee not have more than one
38 period during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program to reinstate
39 insurance; and (2) instead provides that if a person has more than one period during which he
40 or she was not covered by insurance under the Program, the Board may require the person to
41 provide evidence of continuous coverage provided under another health insurance plan during
42 any period other than the first period in which he or she was not covered to reinstate insurance
43 under the Program.
44 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving spouse to
45 reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and (2)
46 provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive
47 the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
48 Existing law establishes for the 2025-2027 biennium the share of the cost of qualified
49 medical expenses for individual Medicare insurance plans through the Program that is
50 required to be paid by the State and local governments for retired public officers and
51 employees. (Chapter 57, Statutes of Nevada 2025) Section 4.1 of this bill increases those
52 amounts for Fiscal Year 2026-2027. Section 4.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to
53 pay for the increases.
54 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government
55 Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the Public Employees’
56 Benefits Program.
57 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the Program to
58 the provisions of section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 287 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new

8 through the Program by an individual medical plan offered pursuant to the
9 Health Insurance for the Aged Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq., that is actuarially
10 comparable to the plan of health insurance offered by the Program to retirees
