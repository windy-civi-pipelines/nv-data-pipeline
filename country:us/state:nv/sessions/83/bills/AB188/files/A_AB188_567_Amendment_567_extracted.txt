EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; requiring the Board
of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to report certain
information relating to the costs of health insurance for certain retirees;
revising provisions relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and
welfare benefits for certain state employees who have retired with state
service; revising requirements for certain retired public officers and
employees to reinstate insurance under the Program; requiring the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs to
conduct an interim study on the Program; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay for a portion
2 of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public Employees’ Benefits Program on
3 behalf of persons who were initially hired before January 1, 2012, and have retired with state
4 service, which must be: (1) deposited in the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund
5 to pay a portion of the current and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2)
6 based upon a base amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also
7 requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to
8 the Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for persons who
9 retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the Legislature multiplied by
10 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1, 1994, the base funding level
11 multiplied by the years of service of the person, excluding service purchased, up to a
12 maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program
13 to report, before August 31 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim
14 Retirement and Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
15 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered by
16 the Program.
17 Section 3 of this bill requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through
18 the federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who were initially hired on or after
19 January 1, 2012, the portion paid to the Program must be the base funding level
Assembly Amendment No. 567 to Assembly Bill No. 188 Page 4
20 multiplied by years of state service of the person, excluding service purchased and any
21 years of local governmental service, up to a maximum of 20 years.
22 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or
23 Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 [of this bill] prohibits the
24 Board, unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1) establishing limits on the yearly
25 balance of [such] a health reimbursement [arrangements;] arrangement for a person who is
26 enrolled in Medicare that is less than the total amount of the subsidy paid by the Board
27 in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years; and (2) reverting money in a health
28 reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund unless the retiree has died or, for more than
29 2 consecutive years, elected coverage other than coverage provided through TRICARE,
30 Medicare or the plan offered by the Program.
31 Under existing law, persons hired on or after January 1, 2012, are ineligible to receive a
32 subsidy to pay a portion of their current and future health and welfare benefits upon
33 retirement. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 provides that persons hired on and after January 1, 2012,
34 are eligible to receive the subsidy from the Fund [, subject to the same adjustments and
35 limitations as retirees who were initially hired on or after January 1, 2010, which require, with
36 certain exceptions, that] if the retiree [must have:] has: (1) participated in the Program on a
37 continuous basis since retirement; and (2) 15 years of state service . [, which must include
38 state service and may include local governmental service.]
39 Under existing law, the subsidy for persons who retire on or after January 1, 1994,
40 who are not enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who have more
41 than 15 years of service must be increased by 7.5 percent of the base funding level for
42 each year of service greater than 15 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 requires that, for
43 persons who were initially hired by the State on or after January 1, 2012, the amount by
44 which the subsidy is increased must be based on each year of state service and may not
45 include any years of local governmental service.
46 Section 3 authorizes a participating local governmental agency to pay an additional
47 subsidy on behalf of persons who were initially hired by the State on or after January 1,
48 2012, who have at least 15 years of state service and have continuously participated in
49 the Program since retirement and who also have any number of years of local
50 governmental service.
51 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse of a
52 retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance under the
53 Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not have more than one
54 period during which the retired public officer or employee was not covered by insurance
55 under the Program on or after the later of October 1, 2011, or the date of retirement of the
56 public officer or employee, and the officer or employee retired from: (1) a participating state
57 or local governmental agency under certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement
58 program established by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional
59 staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local [government]
60 governmental agency, under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance,
61 the public officer or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program
62 not later than 31 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475) Section 4
63 of this bill: (1) removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or employee not have
64 more than one period during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program
65 to reinstate insurance; and (2) instead provides that if a person has more than one period
66 during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program, the Board
67 may require the person to provide evidence of continuous coverage provided under
68 another health insurance plan during any period other than the first period in which he
69 or she was not covered to reinstate insurance under the Program.
70 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving spouse to
71 reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and [(3)] (2)
72 provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive
73 the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
74 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
75 Government Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the
76 Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
77 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the Program to
78 the provisions of section 1.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 4)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; requiring the Board
of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to report certain
information relating to the costs of health insurance for certain retirees;
revising provisions relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and
welfare benefits for certain state employees who have retired with state
service; revising requirements for certain retired public officers and
employees to reinstate insurance under the Program; requiring the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs to
conduct an interim study on the Program; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay for a portion
2 of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public Employees’ Benefits Program on
3 behalf of persons who were initially hired before January 1, 2012, and have retired with state
4 service, which must be: (1) deposited in the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund
5 to pay a portion of the current and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2)
6 based upon a base amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also
7 requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to
8 the Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for persons who
9 retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the Legislature multiplied by
10 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1, 1994, the base funding level
11 multiplied by the years of service of the person, excluding service purchased, up to a
12 maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program
13 to report, before August 31 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim
14 Retirement and Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
15 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered by
16 the Program.
17 Section 3 of this bill requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through
18 the federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who were initially hired on or after
19 January 1, 2012, the portion paid to the Program must be the base funding level

Assembly Amendment No. 567 to Assembly Bill No. 188 Page 4
20 multiplied by years of state service of the person, excluding service purchased and any
21 years of local governmental service, up to a maximum of 20 years.
22 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or
23 Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 [of this bill] prohibits the
24 Board, unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1) establishing limits on the yearly
25 balance of [such] a health reimbursement [arrangements;] arrangement for a person who is
26 enrolled in Medicare that is less than the total amount of the subsidy paid by the Board
27 in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years; and (2) reverting money in a health
28 reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund unless the retiree has died or, for more than
29 2 consecutive years, elected coverage other than coverage provided through TRICARE,
30 Medicare or the plan offered by the Program.
31 Under existing law, persons hired on or after January 1, 2012, are ineligible to receive a
32 subsidy to pay a portion of their current and future health and welfare benefits upon
33 retirement. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 provides that persons hired on and after January 1, 2012,
34 are eligible to receive the subsidy from the Fund [, subject to the same adjustments and
35 limitations as retirees who were initially hired on or after January 1, 2010, which require, with
36 certain exceptions, that] if the retiree [must have:] has: (1) participated in the Program on a
37 continuous basis since retirement; and (2) 15 years of state service . [, which must include
38 state service and may include local governmental service.]
39 Under existing law, the subsidy for persons who retire on or after January 1, 1994,
40 who are not enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who have more
41 than 15 years of service must be increased by 7.5 percent of the base funding level for
42 each year of service greater than 15 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 requires that, for
43 persons who were initially hired by the State on or after January 1, 2012, the amount by
44 which the subsidy is increased must be based on each year of state service and may not
45 include any years of local governmental service.
46 Section 3 authorizes a participating local governmental agency to pay an additional
47 subsidy on behalf of persons who were initially hired by the State on or after January 1,
48 2012, who have at least 15 years of state service and have continuously participated in
49 the Program since retirement and who also have any number of years of local
50 governmental service.
51 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse of a
52 retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance under the
53 Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not have more than one
54 period during which the retired public officer or employee was not covered by insurance
55 under the Program on or after the later of October 1, 2011, or the date of retirement of the
56 public officer or employee, and the officer or employee retired from: (1) a participating state
57 or local governmental agency under certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement
58 program established by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional
59 staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local [government]
60 governmental agency, under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance,
61 the public officer or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program
62 not later than 31 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475) Section 4
63 of this bill: (1) removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or employee not have
64 more than one period during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program
65 to reinstate insurance; and (2) instead provides that if a person has more than one period
66 during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program, the Board
67 may require the person to provide evidence of continuous coverage provided under
68 another health insurance plan during any period other than the first period in which he
69 or she was not covered to reinstate insurance under the Program.
70 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving spouse to
71 reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and [(3)] (2)
72 provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive
73 the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
74 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
75 Government Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the
76 Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
77 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the Program to
78 the provisions of section 1.
