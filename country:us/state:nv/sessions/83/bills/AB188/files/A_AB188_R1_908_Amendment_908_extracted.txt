EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; requiring the Board
of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to report certain
information relating to the costs of health insurance for certain retirees;
revising provisions relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and
welfare benefits for certain state employees who have retired with state
service; revising requirements for certain retired public officers and
employees to reinstate insurance under the Program; requiring the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs to conduct an
interim study on the Program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay for a portion
2 of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public Employees’ Benefits Program on
3 behalf of persons who were initially hired before January 1, 2012, and have retired with state
4 service, which must be: (1) deposited in the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund
5 to pay a portion of the current and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2)
6 based upon a base amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also
7 requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to
8 the Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for persons who
9 retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the Legislature multiplied by
10 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1, 1994, the base funding level
11 multiplied by the years of service of the person, excluding service purchased, up to a
12 maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program
13 to report, before August 31 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim
14 Retirement and Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
15 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered by
16 the Program.
17 [Section 3 of this bill requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through the
18 federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who were initially hired on or after January 1,
19 2012, the portion paid to the Program must be the base funding level multiplied by years of
Assembly Amendment No. 908 to Assembly Bill No. 188 First Reprint Page 4
20 state service of the person, excluding service purchased and any years of local governmental
21 service, up to a maximum of 20 years.]
22 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or
23 Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 of this bill prohibits the Board,
24 unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1) establishing limits on the yearly balance of
25 a health reimbursement arrangement for a person who is enrolled in Medicare that is less than
26 the total amount of the subsidy paid by the Board in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years;
27 and (2) reverting money in a health reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund unless
28 the retiree has died or, for more than 2 consecutive years, elected coverage other than
29 coverage provided through TRICARE, Medicare or the plan offered by the Program.
30 [Under existing law, persons hired on or after January 1, 2012, are ineligible to receive a
31 subsidy to pay a portion of their current and future health and welfare benefits upon
32 retirement. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 provides that persons hired on and after January 1, 2012,
33 are eligible to receive the subsidy from the Fund if the retiree has: (1) participated in the
34 Program on a continuous basis since retirement; and (2) 15 years of state service.
35 Under existing law, the subsidy for persons who retire on or after January 1, 1994, who
36 are not enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who have more than 15
37 years of service must be increased by 7.5 percent of the base funding level for each year of
38 service greater than 15 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 requires that, for persons who were
39 initially hired by the State on or after January 1, 2012, the amount by which the subsidy is
40 increased must be based on each year of state service and may not include any years of local
41 governmental service.
42 Section 3 authorizes a participating local governmental agency to pay an additional
43 subsidy on behalf of persons who were initially hired by the State on or after January 1, 2012,
44 who have at least 15 years of state service and have continuously participated in the Program
45 since retirement and who also have any number of years of local governmental service.]
46 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse of a
47 retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance under the
48 Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not have more than one
49 period during which the retired public officer or employee was not covered by insurance
50 under the Program on or after the later of October 1, 2011, or the date of retirement of the
51 public officer or employee, and the officer or employee retired from: (1) a participating state
52 or local governmental agency under certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement
53 program established by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional
54 staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local governmental
55 agency, under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance, the public officer
56 or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program not later than 31
57 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
58 removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or employee not have more than one
59 period during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program to reinstate
60 insurance; and (2) instead provides that if a person has more than one period during which he
61 or she was not covered by insurance under the Program, the Board may require the person to
62 provide evidence of continuous coverage provided under another health insurance plan during
63 any period other than the first period in which he or she was not covered to reinstate insurance
64 under the Program.
65 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving spouse to
66 reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and (2)
67 provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive
68 the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
69 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government
70 Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the Public Employees’
71 Benefits Program.
72 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the Program to
73 the provisions of section 1.

Program. (BDR 23-673)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 4)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; requiring the Board
of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to report certain
information relating to the costs of health insurance for certain retirees;
revising provisions relating to the subsidy paid for certain health and
welfare benefits for certain state employees who have retired with state
service; revising requirements for certain retired public officers and
employees to reinstate insurance under the Program; requiring the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs to conduct an
interim study on the Program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Office of Finance to establish an assessment to pay for a portion
2 of the costs of the premiums or contributions for the Public Employees’ Benefits Program on
3 behalf of persons who were initially hired before January 1, 2012, and have retired with state
4 service, which must be: (1) deposited in the State Retirees’ Health and Welfare Benefits Fund
5 to pay a portion of the current and future health and welfare benefits of those retirees; and (2)
6 based upon a base amount approved by the Legislature each session. Existing law also
7 requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through Medicare, the portion paid to
8 the Program from the Retirees’ Fund on behalf of these retirees must be: (1) for persons who
9 retired before January 1, 1994, the base funding level defined by the Legislature multiplied by
10 15; and (2) for persons who retired on or after January 1, 1994, the base funding level
11 multiplied by the years of service of the person, excluding service purchased, up to a
12 maximum of 20 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board of the Program
13 to report, before August 31 of every even-numbered year, to the Governor and the Interim
14 Retirement and Benefits Committee of the Legislature the typical full cost for such retirees to
15 obtain actuarially comparable health insurance as state retirees enrolled in the plan offered by
16 the Program.
17 [Section 3 of this bill requires that, for retirees who receive health coverage through the
18 federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who were initially hired on or after January 1,
19 2012, the portion paid to the Program must be the base funding level multiplied by years of

Assembly Amendment No. 908 to Assembly Bill No. 188 First Reprint Page 4
20 state service of the person, excluding service purchased and any years of local governmental
21 service, up to a maximum of 20 years.]
22 If the Board pays the subsidy for retirees enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or
23 Medicare into a health reimbursement arrangement, section 3 of this bill prohibits the Board,
24 unless otherwise required by federal law, from: (1) establishing limits on the yearly balance of
25 a health reimbursement arrangement for a person who is enrolled in Medicare that is less than
26 the total amount of the subsidy paid by the Board in the immediately preceding 5 fiscal years;
27 and (2) reverting money in a health reimbursement arrangement to the Retirees’ Fund unless
28 the retiree has died or, for more than 2 consecutive years, elected coverage other than
29 coverage provided through TRICARE, Medicare or the plan offered by the Program.
30 [Under existing law, persons hired on or after January 1, 2012, are ineligible to receive a
31 subsidy to pay a portion of their current and future health and welfare benefits upon
32 retirement. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 provides that persons hired on and after January 1, 2012,
33 are eligible to receive the subsidy from the Fund if the retiree has: (1) participated in the
34 Program on a continuous basis since retirement; and (2) 15 years of state service.
35 Under existing law, the subsidy for persons who retire on or after January 1, 1994, who
36 are not enrolled in the federal TRICARE program or Medicare and who have more than 15
37 years of service must be increased by 7.5 percent of the base funding level for each year of
38 service greater than 15 years. (NRS 287.046) Section 3 requires that, for persons who were
39 initially hired by the State on or after January 1, 2012, the amount by which the subsidy is
40 increased must be based on each year of state service and may not include any years of local
41 governmental service.
42 Section 3 authorizes a participating local governmental agency to pay an additional
43 subsidy on behalf of persons who were initially hired by the State on or after January 1, 2012,
44 who have at least 15 years of state service and have continuously participated in the Program
45 since retirement and who also have any number of years of local governmental service.]
46 Under existing law, a retired public officer or employee or the surviving spouse of a
47 retired public officer or employee who is deceased may reinstate any insurance under the
48 Program, except life insurance, if the public officer or employee did not have more than one
49 period during which the retired public officer or employee was not covered by insurance
50 under the Program on or after the later of October 1, 2011, or the date of retirement of the
51 public officer or employee, and the officer or employee retired from: (1) a participating state
52 or local governmental agency under certain circumstances or was enrolled in the retirement
53 program established by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada for professional
54 staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education; or (2) a nonparticipating local governmental
55 agency, under certain circumstances. (NRS 287.046) To reinstate insurance, the public officer
56 or employee or surviving spouse must provide written notice to the Program not later than 31
57 days before the commencement of the plan year. (NRS 287.0475) Section 4 of this bill: (1)
58 removes the prohibition that the retired public officer or employee not have more than one
59 period during which he or she was not covered by insurance under the Program to reinstate
60 insurance; and (2) instead provides that if a person has more than one period during which he
61 or she was not covered by insurance under the Program, the Board may require the person to
62 provide evidence of continuous coverage provided under another health insurance plan during
63 any period other than the first period in which he or she was not covered to reinstate insurance
64 under the Program.
65 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the public officer or employee or surviving spouse to
66 reinstate coverage during any open enrollment period for the plan of insurance; and (2)
67 provides that the retired public officer or employee is eligible, upon reinstatement, to receive
68 the subsidy provided for certain retired employees.
69 Section 4.5 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government
70 Affairs to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the Public Employees’
71 Benefits Program.
72 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to the Program to
73 the provisions of section 1.
