Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain crimes.
(BDR 15-443)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; revising the definition of the term
“violent or sexual offense” for the purpose of certain
provisions of existing law; requiring certain defendants to
be certified as not representing a high risk to reoffend
before the court may grant probation to or suspend the
sentence of the defendant; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a court from deferring judgment on a case if the
2 defendant has been convicted of a violent or sexual offense. (NRS 176.211)
3 Existing law also: (1) sets the maximum period of probation or suspension of
4 sentence for a violent or sexual offense at 60 months; and (2) requires the Division
5 of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety to petition the court to
6 recommend the early discharge of a person from probation if the person has not
7 been convicted of a violent or sexual offense and satisfies certain other
8 requirements. (NRS 176A.500, 176A.840) Finally, existing law requires a person to
9 report certain violent or sexual offenses against a child to a law enforcement agency
10 under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.882) Section 1 of this bill expands the list
11 of offenses which are deemed to be violent or sexual offenses for the purposes of
12 these provisions.
13 Existing law prohibits a court from granting probation to or suspending the
14 sentence of a person convicted of certain offenses unless the person is certified as
15 not representing a high risk to reoffend. (NRS 176A.110) Section 2 of this bill adds
16 attempted lewdness with a child to the list of offenses which require a certification
17 that the person convicted does not represent a high risk to reoffend.
