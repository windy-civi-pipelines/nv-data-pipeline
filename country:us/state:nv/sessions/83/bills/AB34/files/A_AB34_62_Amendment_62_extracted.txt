SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain crimes. (BDR 15-443)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; revising the definition of the term “violent or sexual
offense” for the purpose of certain provisions of existing law; requiring
certain defendants to be certified as not representing a high risk to
reoffend before the court may grant probation to or suspend the
sentence of the defendant; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a court from deferring judgment on a case if the defendant has
2 been convicted of a violent or sexual offense. (NRS 176.211) Existing law also: (1) sets the
3 maximum period of probation or suspension of sentence for a violent or sexual offense at 60
4 months; and (2) requires the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public
5 Safety to petition the court to recommend the early discharge of a person from probation if the
6 person has not been convicted of a violent or sexual offense and satisfies certain other
7 requirements. (NRS 176A.500, 176A.840) Finally, existing law requires a person to report
8 certain violent or sexual offenses against a child to a law enforcement agency under certain
9 circumstances. (NRS 202.882) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of offenses which are
10 deemed to be violent or sexual offenses for the purposes of these provisions.
11 Existing law prohibits a court from granting probation to or suspending the sentence of a
12 person convicted of certain offenses unless the person is certified as not representing a high
13 risk to reoffend. (NRS 176A.110) Section 2 of this bill adds attempted lewdness with a child
14 to the list of offenses which require a certification that the person convicted does not represent
15 a high risk to reoffend.

8 certain violent or sexual offenses against a child to a law enforcement agency under certain

11 Existing law prohibits a court from granting probation to or suspending the sentence of a
12 person convicted of certain offenses unless the person is certified as not representing a high
