Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that in any county for all or part of which a streets and
2 highways plan has been adopted as a part of the master plan by the county or
3 regional planning commission, the board of county commissioners may by
4 ordinance create a regional transportation commission. A commission may perform
5 certain duties prescribed by law, such as operating a system of public transportation
6 within its area of jurisdiction and using streets, roads, highways and other public
7 rights-of-way for public transportation. (NRS 277A.170, 277A.270) Section 1 of
8 this bill requires a regional transportation commission in a county whose population
9 is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to: (1) take certain
10 actions to mitigate safety risks to transit operators, including, without limitation,
11 installing and maintaining appropriate infrastructure and technology designed to
12 mitigate safety risks to transit operators such as the use of barriers, panic buttons
13 and other technology; and (2) install and maintain appropriate signage informing
14 the public about the criminal penalties for certain crimes committed against transit
15 operators or the public.
16 Existing law establishes an increased penalty for assault or battery committed
17 upon a transit operator, which is defined as a person who operates a bus or other

19 performing his or her duty and the person charged knew or should have known that
20 the victim was a transit operator. (NRS 200.471, 200.481) Section 2 of this bill: (1)
21 authorizes a governmental entity that operates a public mass transportation system
22 to petition the district court for a public transportation trespass order against a
23 person who has been convicted of assault or battery against a transit operator; (2)
24 sets forth requirements for the issuance, modification and termination of such an
25 order; and (3) provides that violation of such an order is a misdemeanor.
