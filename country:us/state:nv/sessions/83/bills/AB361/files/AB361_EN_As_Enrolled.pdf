Existing law provides that in any county for all or part of which a streets and
highways plan has been adopted as a part of the master plan by the county or
regional planning commission, the board of county commissioners may by
ordinance create a regional transportation commission. A commission may perform
certain duties prescribed by law, such as operating a system of public transportation
within its area of jurisdiction and using streets, roads, highways and other public
rights-of-way for public transportation. (NRS 277A.170, 277A.270) Section 1 of
this bill requires a regional transportation commission in a county whose population

installing and maintaining appropriate infrastructure and technology designed to
mitigate safety risks to transit operators such as the use of barriers, panic buttons
and other technology; and (2) install and maintain appropriate signage informing
the public about the criminal penalties for certain crimes committed against transit
operators or the public.
