4 ordinance create a regional transportation commission. A commission may perform
5 certain duties prescribed by law, such as operating a system of public transportation
6 within its area of jurisdiction and using streets, roads, highways and other public
7 rights-of-way for public transportation. (NRS 277A.170, 277A.270) Section 1 of
8 this bill requires a regional transportation commission in a county whose population
9 is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to: (1) take certain
10 actions to mitigate safety risks to transit operators, including, without limitation,
