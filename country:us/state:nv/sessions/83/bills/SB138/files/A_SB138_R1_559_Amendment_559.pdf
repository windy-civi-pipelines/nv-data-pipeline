AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring certain hospitals to enroll as a qualified
provider for determining whether a pregnant woman is presumptively

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain hospitals to enter into agreements with the United States
2 Secretary of Health and Human Services to accept payment through Medicare. (NRS
3 449.1821) Existing law also requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
4 Services to authorize a pregnant woman who is determined to be presumptively eligible for
5 Medicaid to enroll in Medicaid for a specified period of time without submitting an
6 application for enrollment in Medicaid which includes additional proof of eligibility. (NRS
7 422.27171) Section 2.4 of this bill requires a hospital that provides birthing services to [: (1)]
8 enroll as a qualified provider to determine whether a pregnant woman is presumptively
9 eligible for Medicaid [; (2)] or contract with an entity that is qualified to make such
10 determinations under federal law. Section 2.4 requires the hospital or qualified entity to:
11 (1) determine whether each pregnant woman seeking services from the hospital is
12 presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and [(3)] (2) notify a pregnant woman and the parent or
13 legal guardian of certain newborn children of federal benefits that the woman or child, as
14 applicable, may be eligible to receive.
15 Existing law establishes certain rights for patients of medical facilities and facilities for
16 the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Section 2.6 of this bill establishes certain rights of
17 a parent or legal guardian of a newborn child who is receiving care in a neonatal intensive

18 care unit of a hospital. Section 2.2 of this bill authorizes the suspension or revocation of the
19 license of a hospital that fails to honor such rights.
