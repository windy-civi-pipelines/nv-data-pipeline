AN ACT relating to Medicaid; providing for the establishment of
presumptive eligibility under Medicaid and automatic
enrollment in Medicaid for certain infants admitted to a
neonatal intensive care unit; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop
2 and administer a State Plan for Medicaid, which includes a list of specific medical
3 services that must be provided to recipients of Medicaid. (NRS 422.063, 422.270;
4 42 U.S.C. § 1396a) Existing federal law authorizes a state to provide benefits under
5 Medicaid for a prescribed period of presumptive eligibility to a child who is
6 determined to be eligible for Medicaid by an entity that meets certain requirements.
7 (42 U.S.C. § 1396r-1a) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to establish
8 such presumptive eligibility under Medicaid for an infant who has been admitted to
9 a neonatal intensive care unit. Section 1 also requires the Department to establish
10 automatic enrollment in Medicaid for such an infant, if the Social Security
11 Administration determines that the infant or the parent or legal guardian of the
12 infant is eligible to receive benefits from the Supplemental Security Income
13 Program, which is a federal program to supplement the income of certain persons
14 who are aged, blind or disabled. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1381 et seq.) Section 2 of this bill
15 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to administer
16 section 1 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing the State
17 Plan for Medicaid.
