EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring certain hospitals to enroll
as a qualified provider for determining whether a pregnant
woman is presumptively eligible for Medicaid or contract
with certain entities to make such determinations;
requiring such hospitals and contractors to provide notices
relating to Medicaid to certain persons; prescribing
certain rights for parents and legal guardians of newborn
children who are patients in a neonatal intensive care unit

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain hospitals to enter into agreements with the United
2 States Secretary of Health and Human Services to accept payment through
3 Medicare. (NRS 449.1821) Existing law also requires the Director of the
4 Department of Health and Human Services to authorize a pregnant woman who is
5 determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid to enroll in Medicaid for a
6 specified period of time without submitting an application for enrollment in
7 Medicaid which includes additional proof of eligibility. (NRS 422.27171) Section
8 2.4 of this bill requires a hospital that provides birthing services to enroll as a
9 qualified provider to determine whether a pregnant woman is presumptively
10 eligible for Medicaid or contract with an entity that is qualified to make such

11 determinations under federal law. Section 2.4 requires the hospital or qualified
12 entity to: (1) determine whether each pregnant woman seeking services from the
13 hospital is presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (2) notify a pregnant woman
14 and the parent or legal guardian of certain newborn children of federal benefits that
15 the woman or child, as applicable, may be eligible to receive.
16 Existing law establishes certain rights for patients of medical facilities and
17 facilities for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Section 2.6 of this bill
18 establishes certain rights of a parent or legal guardian of a newborn child who is
19 receiving care in a neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital. Section 2.2 of this bill
20 authorizes the suspension or revocation of the license of a hospital that fails to
21 honor such rights.
