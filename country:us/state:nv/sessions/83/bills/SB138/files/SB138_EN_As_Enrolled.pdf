CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring certain hospitals to enroll
as a qualified provider for determining whether a pregnant
woman is presumptively eligible for Medicaid or contract
with certain entities to make such determinations; requiring
such hospitals and contractors to provide notices relating to
Medicaid to certain persons; prescribing certain rights for
parents and legal guardians of newborn children who are
patients in a neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain hospitals to enter into agreements with the United
States Secretary of Health and Human Services to accept payment through
Medicare. (NRS 449.1821) Existing law also requires the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to authorize a pregnant woman who is
determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid to enroll in Medicaid for a
specified period of time without submitting an application for enrollment in
Medicaid which includes additional proof of eligibility. (NRS 422.27171) Section
2.4 of this bill requires a hospital that provides birthing services to enroll as a
qualified provider to determine whether a pregnant woman is presumptively
eligible for Medicaid or contract with an entity that is qualified to make such
determinations under federal law. Section 2.4 requires the hospital or qualified
entity to: (1) determine whether each pregnant woman seeking services from the
hospital is presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (2) notify a pregnant woman
and the parent or legal guardian of certain newborn children of federal benefits that
the woman or child, as applicable, may be eligible to receive.
Existing law establishes certain rights for patients of medical facilities and
facilities for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Section 2.6 of this bill
establishes certain rights of a parent or legal guardian of a newborn child who is
receiving care in a neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital. Section 2.2 of this bill
authorizes the suspension or revocation of the license of a hospital that fails to
honor such rights.
