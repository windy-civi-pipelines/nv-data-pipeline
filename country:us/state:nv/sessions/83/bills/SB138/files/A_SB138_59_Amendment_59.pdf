AN ACT relating to Medicaid; [providing for the establishment of presumptive
eligibility under Medicaid and automatic enrollment in Medicaid for
certain infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit;] requiring
certain hospitals to enroll as a qualified provider for determining
whether a pregnant woman is presumptively eligible for Medicaid;
requiring such hospitals to provide notices relating to Medicaid to
certain persons; prescribing certain rights for parents and legal
guardians of newborn children who are patients in a neonatal
intensive care unit of a hospital; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain hospitals to enter into agreements with the United
2 States Secretary of Health and Human Services to accept payment through Medicare.
3 (NRS 449.1821) Existing law also requires the Director of the Department of Health and
4 Human Services to [develop and administer a State Plan for Medicaid, which includes a list of
5 specific medical services that must be provided to recipients of Medicaid. (NRS 422.063,
6 422.270; 42 U.S.C. § 1396a) Existing federal law authorizes a state to provide benefits under
7 Medicaid for a prescribed period of presumptive eligibility to a child who is determined to be
8 eligible for Medicaid by an entity that meets certain requirements. (42 U.S.C. § 1396r-1a)
9 Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to establish such presumptive eligibility under
10 Medicaid for an infant who has been admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. Section 1 also
11 requires the Department to establish automatic enrollment in Medicaid for such an infant, if
12 the Social Security Administration determines that the infant or the parent or legal guardian of
13 the infant is eligible to receive benefits from the Supplemental Security Income Program,
14 which is a federal program to supplement the income of certain persons who are aged, blind or
15 disabled. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1381 et seq.) Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
16 require the Director of the Department to administer section 1 in the same manner as the
17 provisions of existing law governing the State Plan for Medicaid.] authorize a pregnant
18 woman who is determined to be presumptively eligible for Medicaid to enroll in

Senate Amendment No. 59 to Senate Bill No. 138 Page 4
19 Medicaid for a specified period of time without submitting an application for enrollment
20 in Medicaid which includes additional proof of eligibility. (NRS 422.27171) Section 2.4 of
21 this bill requires a hospital that provides birthing services to: (1) enroll as a qualified
22 provider to determine whether a pregnant woman is presumptively eligible for
23 Medicaid; (2) determine whether each pregnant woman seeking services from the
24 hospital is presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (3) notify a pregnant woman and the
25 parent or legal guardian of certain newborn children of federal benefits that the woman
26 or child, as applicable, may be eligible to receive.
27 Existing law establishes certain rights for patients of medical facilities and facilities
28 for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Section 2.6 of this bill establishes certain
29 rights of a parent or legal guardian of a newborn child who is receiving care in a
30 neonatal intensive care unit of a hospital. Section 2.2 of this bill authorizes the
31 suspension or revocation of the license of a hospital that fails to honor such rights.

9 enrollment in Medicaid which includes additional proof of eligibility; and
10 (b) Automatic enrollment in Medicaid without a separate application for an
