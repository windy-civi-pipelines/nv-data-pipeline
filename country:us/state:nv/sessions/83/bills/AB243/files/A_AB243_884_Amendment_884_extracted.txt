EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the property and
governmental services taxes for [surviving spouses of members of the
armed forces killed in the line of duty;] certain Nevada Gold Star
Spouses; establishing certain requirements for claiming the
exemptions; requiring the maximum allowable amount of the
exemptions be adjusted annually; authorizing an eligible [surviving
spouse] Nevada Gold Star Spouse to direct an amount equivalent to
the exemptions to certain charitable gift accounts in lieu of claiming
the exemptions; providing for the reduction of the property tax
exemption in certain circumstances; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of property,
2 adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a surviving spouse who is
3 a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080) Existing law also exempts from
4 property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year
5 using the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran who served on active duty under certain
6 circumstances has an interest; and (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as
7 adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a
8 permanent service-connected disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a
9 veteran, has an interest. (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these
10 exemptions to property taxes, the same partial exemptions may be applied to reduce the
11 amount of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran or
12 surviving spouse of a veteran or disabled veteran upon the annual renewal of the registration
13 of a vehicle. (NRS 361.1565, 371.101, 371.103, 371.104)
14 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill, respectively, [increase the partial exemption] exempt from
15 property taxes and governmental services taxes [for the surviving spouse of a member of the
16 Armed Forces of the United States who was killed in action. Under sections 1 and 4, the
17 amount of the exemption increases from the exemption of $1,000 for surviving spouses to the
Assembly Amendment No. 884 to Assembly Bill No. 243 Page 4
18 amount of the exemption for the surviving spouse of a veteran with a permanent service-
19 connected disability of 100 percent.] $20,000 of the assessed valuation of the property of a
20 Nevada Gold Star Spouse. Sections 1 and 4 define Nevada Gold Star Spouse as the
21 surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who died under
22 certain circumstances while on active duty in the Armed Forces and who, at the time of
23 his or her death, was a resident of this State. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
24 change to apply to sections 1 and 4 existing law which requires a partial exemption from
25 property taxes to be reduced by any partial exemption from the governmental services taxes.
26 Sections 2 and 5 of this bill make a conforming change to authorize a [surviving spouse]
27 Nevada Gold Star Spouse who qualifies for the partial exemption from property taxes or
28 governmental services taxes under section 1 or 4, respectively, to request the deposit of an
29 amount equal to the partial exemption to the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Southern
30 Nevada or the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada. (NRS 361.0905,
31 371.1035) Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to section 4 existing law
32 governing the filing of claims for exemptions for governmental services tax or the designation
33 of amounts to be credited to a Gift Account for a Veterans Home. (NRS 371.105) Section 7 of
34 this bill makes a conforming change to apply existing law requiring the provision of notice to
35 the Department of Motor Vehicles when an owner of a vehicle is no longer eligible for the
36 exemption under section 4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 361 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new

6 exemption not to exceed the amount of $20,000 assessed valuation. For the
7 purposes of this section, the first $20,000 assessed valuation of property in which
8 a person has any interest is deemed to be the property of the person.
9 2. The exemption may be allowed only to a claimant who has filed an
10 affidavit with his or her claim for exemption on real property pursuant to NRS
11 361.155. The affidavit may be made at any time by a person claiming an
12 exemption from taxation on personal property.
13 3. The affidavit required by subsection 2 must be made before the county

15 that the affiant:

25 (b) The designation of any amount to be credited to the Gift Account for the
26 Veterans Home in Southern Nevada or the Gift Account for the Veterans Home

28  to the person each year following a year in which the exemption was allowed
29 for that person. The form must be designed to facilitate its return by mail by the
30 person claiming the exemption. If so requested by the person claiming the
Assembly Amendment No. 884 to Assembly Bill No. 243 Page 5

15 1126(a); and
16 (2) Listed Nevada as his or her home of record; and
17 (b) Documentation that the person was married to the member.
18 6. The allowance of a tax exemption to a person under this section does not
19 affect the eligibility of that person for an exemption under NRS 361.090 or
20 361.091 based on the person’s own service in the Armed Forces of the United
21 States, if applicable.
22 7. If any person files a false affidavit or produces false proof to the county
23 assessor or a notary public and, as a result of the false affidavit or false proof, the
24 person is allowed a tax exemption to which the person is not entitled, the person
25 is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
26 8. [The monetary amounts in subsection 1 must be adjusted for each fiscal
27 year by adding to the amount the product of the amount multiplied by the
28 percentage increase in the consumer price inflation index from July 2003 to the
29 July preceding the fiscal year for which the adjustment is calculated. The

AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the property and

3 a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080) Existing law also exempts from
4 property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year
5 using the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran who served on active duty under certain
6 circumstances has an interest; and (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as
7 adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a
8 permanent service-connected disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a
9 veteran, has an interest. (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these
10 exemptions to property taxes, the same partial exemptions may be applied to reduce the
11 amount of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran or
12 surviving spouse of a veteran or disabled veteran upon the annual renewal of the registration
13 of a vehicle. (NRS 361.1565, 371.101, 371.103, 371.104)

17 amount of the exemption increases from the exemption of $1,000 for surviving spouses to the

18 amount of the exemption for the surviving spouse of a veteran with a permanent service-
19 connected disability of 100 percent.] $20,000 of the assessed valuation of the property of a
20 Nevada Gold Star Spouse. Sections 1 and 4 define Nevada Gold Star Spouse as the
21 surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who died under
22 certain circumstances while on active duty in the Armed Forces and who, at the time of
23 his or her death, was a resident of this State. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
24 change to apply to sections 1 and 4 existing law which requires a partial exemption from
25 property taxes to be reduced by any partial exemption from the governmental services taxes.
26 Sections 2 and 5 of this bill make a conforming change to authorize a [surviving spouse]
27 Nevada Gold Star Spouse who qualifies for the partial exemption from property taxes or
28 governmental services taxes under section 1 or 4, respectively, to request the deposit of an
29 amount equal to the partial exemption to the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Southern
30 Nevada or the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada. (NRS 361.0905,
31 371.1035) Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to section 4 existing law
32 governing the filing of claims for exemptions for governmental services tax or the designation
33 of amounts to be credited to a Gift Account for a Veterans Home. (NRS 371.105) Section 7 of
34 this bill makes a conforming change to apply existing law requiring the provision of notice to
35 the Department of Motor Vehicles when an owner of a vehicle is no longer eligible for the
36 exemption under section 4.

21 States, if applicable.
22 7. If any person files a false affidavit or produces false proof to the county

25 is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
