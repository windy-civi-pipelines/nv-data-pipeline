EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the
property and governmental services taxes for certain
Nevada Gold Star Spouses; establishing certain
requirements for claiming the exemptions; requiring the
maximum allowable amount of the exemptions be
adjusted annually; authorizing an eligible Nevada Gold
Star Spouse to direct an amount equivalent to the
exemptions to certain charitable gift accounts in lieu of
claiming the exemptions; providing for the reduction of
the property tax exemption in certain circumstances;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of
2 property, adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
3 surviving spouse who is a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080)
4 Existing law also exempts from property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation
5 of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
6 veteran who served on active duty under certain circumstances has an interest; and
7 (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using
8 the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a permanent service-connected
9 disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a veteran, has an interest.
10 (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these exemptions
11 to property taxes, the same partial exemptions may be applied to reduce the amount
12 of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran
13 or surviving spouse of a veteran or disabled veteran upon the annual renewal of the
14 registration of a vehicle. (NRS 361.1565, 371.101, 371.103, 371.104)

15 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill, respectively, exempt from property taxes and
16 governmental services taxes $20,000 of the assessed valuation, adjusted each fiscal
17 year using the Consumer Price Index, of the property of a Nevada Gold Star
18 Spouse. Sections 1 and 4 define Nevada Gold Star Spouse as the surviving spouse
19 of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who died under certain
20 circumstances while on active duty in the Armed Forces and who, at the time of his
21 or her death, was a resident of this State. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
22 change to apply to sections 1 and 4 existing law which requires a partial exemption
23 from property taxes to be reduced by any partial exemption from the governmental
24 services taxes. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill make a conforming change to authorize
25 a Nevada Gold Star Spouse who qualifies for the partial exemption from property
26 taxes or governmental services taxes under section 1 or 4, respectively, to request
27 the deposit of an amount equal to the partial exemption to the Gift Account for the
28 Veterans Home in Southern Nevada or the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in
29 Northern Nevada. (NRS 361.0905, 371.1035) Section 6 of this bill makes a
30 conforming change to apply to section 4 existing law governing the filing of claims
31 for exemptions for governmental services tax or the designation of amounts to be
32 credited to a Gift Account for a Veterans Home. (NRS 371.105) Section 7 of this
33 bill makes a conforming change to apply existing law requiring the provision of
34 notice to the Department of Motor Vehicles when an owner of a vehicle is no
35 longer eligible for the exemption under section 4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

29 6. The allowance of a tax exemption to a person under this
30 section does not affect the eligibility of that person for an
31 exemption under NRS 361.090 or 361.091 based on the person’s
32 own service in the Armed Forces of the United States, if
33 applicable.
34 7. If any person files a false affidavit or produces false proof
35 to the county assessor or a notary public and, as a result of the
36 false affidavit or false proof, the person is allowed a tax exemption
37 to which the person is not entitled, the person is guilty of a gross
38 misdemeanor.
39 8. The monetary amounts in subsection 1 must be adjusted
40 for each fiscal year by adding to the amount the product of the
41 amount multiplied by the percentage increase in the consumer
42 price inflation index from July 2003 to the July preceding the
43 fiscal year for which the adjustment is calculated. The Department
44 shall provide to each county assessor the adjusted amount, in
45 writing, on or before September 30 of each year.
