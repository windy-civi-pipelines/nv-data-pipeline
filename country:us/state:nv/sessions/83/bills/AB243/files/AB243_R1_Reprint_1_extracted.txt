EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the
property and governmental services taxes for certain
Nevada Gold Star Spouses; establishing certain
requirements for claiming the exemptions; requiring the
maximum allowable amount of the exemptions be
adjusted annually; authorizing an eligible Nevada Gold
Star Spouse to direct an amount equivalent to the
exemptions to certain charitable gift accounts in lieu of
claiming the exemptions; providing for the reduction of
the property tax exemption in certain circumstances;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of
2 property, adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
3 surviving spouse who is a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080)
4 Existing law also exempts from property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation
5 of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
6 veteran who served on active duty under certain circumstances has an interest; and
7 (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using
8 the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a permanent service-connected
9 disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a veteran, has an interest.
10 (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these exemptions
11 to property taxes, the same partial exemptions may be applied to reduce the amount
12 of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran
13 or surviving spouse of a veteran or disabled veteran upon the annual renewal of the
14 registration of a vehicle. (NRS 361.1565, 371.101, 371.103, 371.104)

15 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill, respectively, exempt from property taxes and
16 governmental services taxes $20,000 of the assessed valuation of the property of a
17 Nevada Gold Star Spouse. Sections 1 and 4 define Nevada Gold Star Spouse as the
18 surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who died
19 under certain circumstances while on active duty in the Armed Forces and who, at
20 the time of his or her death, was a resident of this State. Section 3 of this bill makes
21 a conforming change to apply to sections 1 and 4 existing law which requires a
22 partial exemption from property taxes to be reduced by any partial exemption from
23 the governmental services taxes. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill make a conforming
24 change to authorize a Nevada Gold Star Spouse who qualifies for the partial
25 exemption from property taxes or governmental services taxes under section 1 or 4,
26 respectively, to request the deposit of an amount equal to the partial exemption to
27 the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Southern Nevada or the Gift Account
28 for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada. (NRS 361.0905, 371.1035) Section 6
29 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to section 4 existing law governing
30 the filing of claims for exemptions for governmental services tax or the designation
31 of amounts to be credited to a Gift Account for a Veterans Home. (NRS 371.105)
32 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply existing law requiring
33 the provision of notice to the Department of Motor Vehicles when an owner of a
34 vehicle is no longer eligible for the exemption under section 4.

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of
2 property, adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
3 surviving spouse who is a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080)
4 Existing law also exempts from property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation
5 of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
6 veteran who served on active duty under certain circumstances has an interest; and

21 a conforming change to apply to sections 1 and 4 existing law which requires a
22 partial exemption from property taxes to be reduced by any partial exemption from
23 the governmental services taxes. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill make a conforming
24 change to authorize a Nevada Gold Star Spouse who qualifies for the partial
25 exemption from property taxes or governmental services taxes under section 1 or 4,
26 respectively, to request the deposit of an amount equal to the partial exemption to

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

24 (2) Listed Nevada as his or her home of record; and
25 (b) Documentation that the person was married to the member.

29 own service in the Armed Forces of the United States, if
30 applicable.
31 7. If any person files a false affidavit or produces false proof
32 to the county assessor or a notary public and, as a result of the
33 false affidavit or false proof, the person is allowed a tax exemption

39 (1) Died under any of the circumstances described in 10
