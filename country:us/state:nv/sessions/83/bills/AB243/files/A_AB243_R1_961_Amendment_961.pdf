AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the property and
governmental services taxes for certain Nevada Gold Star Spouses;
establishing certain requirements for claiming the exemptions;
requiring the maximum allowable amount of the exemptions be
adjusted annually; authorizing an eligible Nevada Gold Star Spouse to
direct an amount equivalent to the exemptions to certain charitable gift
accounts in lieu of claiming the exemptions; providing for the
reduction of the property tax exemption in certain circumstances;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of property,
2 adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a surviving spouse who is
3 a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080) Existing law also exempts from
4 property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year
5 using the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran who served on active duty under certain
6 circumstances has an interest; and (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as
7 adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a
8 permanent service-connected disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a
9 veteran, has an interest. (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these
10 exemptions to property taxes, the same partial exemptions may be applied to reduce the
11 amount of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran or
12 surviving spouse of a veteran or disabled veteran upon the annual renewal of the registration
13 of a vehicle. (NRS 361.1565, 371.101, 371.103, 371.104)
14 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill, respectively, exempt from property taxes and governmental
15 services taxes $20,000 of the assessed valuation , adjusted each fiscal year using the
16 Consumer Price Index, of the property of a Nevada Gold Star Spouse. Sections 1 and 4
17 define Nevada Gold Star Spouse as the surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of
18 the United States who died under certain circumstances while on active duty in the Armed
19 Forces and who, at the time of his or her death, was a resident of this State. Section 3 of this
20 bill makes a conforming change to apply to sections 1 and 4 existing law which requires a
21 partial exemption from property taxes to be reduced by any partial exemption from the

Senate Amendment No. 961 to Assembly Bill No. 243 First Reprint Page 4
22 governmental services taxes. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill make a conforming change to
23 authorize a Nevada Gold Star Spouse who qualifies for the partial exemption from property
24 taxes or governmental services taxes under section 1 or 4, respectively, to request the deposit
25 of an amount equal to the partial exemption to the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in
26 Southern Nevada or the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada. (NRS
27 361.0905, 371.1035) Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to section 4
28 existing law governing the filing of claims for exemptions for governmental services tax or
29 the designation of amounts to be credited to a Gift Account for a Veterans Home. (NRS
30 371.105) Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply existing law requiring the
31 provision of notice to the Department of Motor Vehicles when an owner of a vehicle is no
32 longer eligible for the exemption under section 4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 361 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. A bona fide resident of the State of Nevada who is a Nevada Gold Star
4 Spouse, and who has not remarried, is entitled to an exemption not to exceed the
5 amount of $20,000 assessed valuation. For the purposes of this section, the first
6 $20,000 assessed valuation of property in which a person has any interest is
7 deemed to be the property of the person.
8 2. The exemption may be allowed only to a claimant who has filed an
9 affidavit with his or her claim for exemption on real property pursuant to NRS
10 361.155. The affidavit may be made at any time by a person claiming an
11 exemption from taxation on personal property.
12 3. The affidavit required by subsection 2 must be made before the county
13 assessor or a notary public and be filed with the county assessor. It must state
14 that the affiant:

16 (b) Is a Nevada Gold Star Spouse;
17 (c) Has not remarried; and
18 (d) Has not claimed the exemption in any other county within this State.

28 person claiming the exemption. If so requested by the person claiming the
29 exemption, the county assessor may provide the form to the person by electronic

15 is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
16 8. The monetary amounts in subsection 1 must be adjusted for each fiscal
17 year by adding to the amount the product of the amount multiplied by the
