EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the
property and governmental services taxes for surviving
spouses of members of the armed forces killed in the line
of duty; establishing certain requirements for claiming the
exemptions; requiring the maximum allowable amount of
the exemptions be adjusted annually; authorizing an
eligible surviving spouse to direct an amount equivalent
to the exemptions to certain charitable gift accounts in
lieu of claiming the exemptions; providing for the
reduction of the property tax exemption in certain
circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of
2 property, adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
3 surviving spouse who is a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080)
4 Existing law also exempts from property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation
5 of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
6 veteran who served on active duty under certain circumstances has an interest; and
7 (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using
8 the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a permanent service-connected
9 disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a veteran, has an interest.
10 (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these exemptions
11 to property taxes, the same partial exemptions may be applied to reduce the amount
12 of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran

13 or surviving spouse of a veteran or disabled veteran upon the annual renewal of the
14 registration of a vehicle. (NRS 361.1565, 371.101, 371.103, 371.104)
15 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill, respectively, increase the partial exemption from
16 property taxes and governmental services taxes for the surviving spouse of a
17 member of the Armed Forces of the United States who was killed in action. Under
18 sections 1 and 4, the amount of the exemption increases from the exemption of
19 $1,000 for surviving spouses to the amount of the exemption for the surviving
20 spouse of a veteran with a permanent service-connected disability of 100 percent.
21 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to sections 1 and 4
22 existing law which requires a partial exemption from property taxes to be reduced
23 by any partial exemption from the governmental services taxes. Sections 2 and 5 of
24 this bill make a conforming change to authorize a surviving spouse who qualifies
25 for the partial exemption from property taxes or governmental services taxes under
26 section 1 or 4, respectively, to request the deposit of an amount equal to the partial
27 exemption to the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Southern Nevada or the
28 Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada. (NRS 361.0905,
29 371.1035) Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to section 4
30 existing law governing the filing of claims for exemptions for governmental
31 services tax or the designation of amounts to be credited to a Gift Account for a
32 Veterans Home. (NRS 371.105) Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change
33 to apply existing law requiring the provision of notice to the Department of Motor
34 Vehicles when an owner of a vehicle is no longer eligible for the exemption under
35 section 4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

3 1. A bona fide resident of the State of Nevada who is the
4 surviving spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United

7 $20,000 assessed valuation. For the purposes of this section, the
8 first $20,000 assessed valuation of property in which a person has

10 2. The exemption may be allowed only to a claimant who has
11 filed an affidavit with his or her claim for exemption on real

14 personal property.
15 3. The affidavit required by subsection 2 must be made before
16 the county assessor or a notary public and be filed with the county
17 assessor. It must state that the affiant:

7 (b) The designation of any amount to be credited to the Gift
8 Account for the Veterans Home in Southern Nevada or the Gift
9 Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada established
10 pursuant to NRS 417.145,
11  to the person each year following a year in which the exemption
12 was allowed for that person. The form must be designed to

14 If so requested by the person claiming the exemption, the county

26 identifies the member of the Armed Forces who was killed in the
27 line of duty; and
28 (b) Documentation that the person was married to the member.
29 6. The allowance of a tax exemption to a person under this
30 section does not affect the eligibility of that person for an
31 exemption under NRS 361.090 or 361.091 based on the person’s
32 own service in the Armed Forces of the United States, if
33 applicable.
34 7. If any person files a false affidavit or produces false proof
35 to the county assessor or a notary public and, as a result of the
36 false affidavit or false proof, the person is allowed a tax exemption
37 to which the person is not entitled, the person is guilty of a gross
38 misdemeanor.
39 8. The monetary amounts in subsection 1 must be adjusted
40 for each fiscal year by adding to the amount the product of the
41 amount multiplied by the percentage increase in the consumer
42 price inflation index from July 2003 to the July preceding the
43 fiscal year for which the adjustment is calculated. The Department
44 shall provide to each county assessor the adjusted amount, in

AN ACT relating to taxation; providing partial exemptions from the
property and governmental services taxes for surviving
spouses of members of the armed forces killed in the line

eligible surviving spouse to direct an amount equivalent
to the exemptions to certain charitable gift accounts in
lieu of claiming the exemptions; providing for the
reduction of the property tax exemption in certain
circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of
2 property, adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
3 surviving spouse who is a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080)
4 Existing law also exempts from property taxes: (1) $2,000 of the assessed valuation
5 of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
6 veteran who served on active duty under certain circumstances has an interest; and
7 (2) $20,000 of the assessed valuation of property, as adjusted each fiscal year using
8 the Consumer Price Index, in which a veteran with a permanent service-connected
9 disability of 100 percent, or the surviving spouse of such a veteran, has an interest.
10 (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Under existing law, in lieu of applying these exemptions

12 of governmental services tax owed by a surviving spouse, veteran, disabled veteran

15 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill, respectively, increase the partial exemption from
16 property taxes and governmental services taxes for the surviving spouse of a
17 member of the Armed Forces of the United States who was killed in action. Under
18 sections 1 and 4, the amount of the exemption increases from the exemption of

22 existing law which requires a partial exemption from property taxes to be reduced
23 by any partial exemption from the governmental services taxes. Sections 2 and 5 of
24 this bill make a conforming change to authorize a surviving spouse who qualifies
25 for the partial exemption from property taxes or governmental services taxes under
26 section 1 or 4, respectively, to request the deposit of an amount equal to the partial
27 exemption to the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Southern Nevada or the
28 Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada. (NRS 361.0905,
29 371.1035) Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply to section 4
30 existing law governing the filing of claims for exemptions for governmental
31 services tax or the designation of amounts to be credited to a Gift Account for a
32 Veterans Home. (NRS 371.105) Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change
33 to apply existing law requiring the provision of notice to the Department of Motor
34 Vehicles when an owner of a vehicle is no longer eligible for the exemption under
35 section 4.

41 amount multiplied by the percentage increase in the consumer
42 price inflation index from July 2003 to the July preceding the
