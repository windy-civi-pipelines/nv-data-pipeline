Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in

3 and administer a program of infrastructure grants for the development or
4 improvement of broadband services for persons with low income and persons in
5 rural areas of this State; and (2) the Office to establish and administer a program to
6 encourage the deployment of broadband infrastructure in underserved communities
7 in this State. (NRS 223.600, 223.610, 223.670) Section 2 of this bill sets forth a
8 legislative declaration regarding the importance of using a well-trained workforce
9 and providing jobs to residents of this State in expending federal money to increase
10 the development of broadband services and infrastructure in this State.
11 Section 3 of this bill requires each state agency that awards grants of federal
12 money for the development of broadband services and infrastructure to: (1)
13 evaluate and assign a score to each grant application received by the state agency
14 based on the factors and relative weights assigned to each factor that the state
15 agency specified in the request for grant applications; and (2) assign a relative
16 weight of 30 percent to a grant application if the applicant submits a signed
17 certification with his or her application. Section 3 provides that the applicant must
18 certify that if the applicant or the provider of broadband services will perform some
19 or all of the work or will subcontract some or all of the work to a licensed
20 contractor, the applicant, provider or contractor: (1) is able to provide certain
21 documentation upon request, meets certain safety and training requirements,
22 provides job opportunities with high-quality wages and employs a qualified local

24 non-supervisory employees directly employed by the applicant who will perform
25 any work financed in whole or in part by the grant money.
26 Section 3 further requires each state agency to include as a condition of any
27 grant award that: (1) the certification provided by the applicant is binding upon the
28 applicant that is awarded the grant money; and (2) if an applicant, provider of
29 broadband services or contractor performs certain work that requires a contractor’s
30 license, certain provisions of law governing public works apply to the work
31 performed by the subcontractor. Lastly, section 3 authorizes any state agency that
32 awards a grant of federal money for the development of broadband services and
33 infrastructure pursuant to section 3 to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions
34 of section 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 232 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 1. The State of Nevada is poised to see a once-in-a-generation
5 wave of federal money resulting from the passage of the
6 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58, and
7 the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Public Law 117-2, which
8 will help to close the digital divide and increase the development of
9 broadband services and infrastructure across the State;
10 2. The State of Nevada needs to ensure that this historic
11 investment creates long-lasting broadband infrastructure that is
12 built by a well-trained workforce;
13 3. Work performed by an unqualified contractor with a
14 poorly trained workforce endangers the public and is not in the
15 best interest of the citizens of this State; and
16 4. Proper stewardship of public money will require that the
17 State of Nevada implement appropriate measures to ensure that
18 any grants of federal money awarded by this State for the
19 development of broadband services and infrastructure prioritize
20 issuing grants to applicants that will ensure the work is performed
21 safely and by a well-trained workforce and that the applicant
22 provides quality jobs to Nevada workers.
23 Sec. 3. 1. In awarding any grant of federal money for the
24 development of broadband services and infrastructure in
25 accordance with federal law, each state agency shall:
26 (a) Evaluate and assign a score to each application for the
27 grant received by the state agency based on the factors and relative
28 weights assigned to each factor that the state agency specified in
29 the request for grant applications; and
30 (b) When ranking the proposals, assign a relative weight of 30
31 percent to an application if the applicant submits a signed
