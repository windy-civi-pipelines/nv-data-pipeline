Senate Bill No. 93–Senator Daly
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to broadband; establishing certain requirements
for a state agency that awards grants of federal money for the
development of broadband services and infrastructure; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
the Office of the Governor and requires: (1) the Director of the Office to establish
and administer a program of infrastructure grants for the development or
improvement of broadband services for persons with low income and persons in
rural areas of this State; and (2) the Office to establish and administer a program to
encourage the deployment of broadband infrastructure in underserved communities
in this State. (NRS 223.600, 223.610, 223.670) Section 2 of this bill sets forth a
legislative declaration regarding the importance of using a well-trained workforce
and providing jobs to residents of this State in expending federal money to increase
the development of broadband services and infrastructure in this State.
Section 3 of this bill requires each state agency that awards grants of federal
money for the development of broadband services and infrastructure to: (1)
evaluate and assign a score to each grant application received by the state agency
based on the factors and relative weights assigned to each factor that the state
agency specified in the request for grant applications; and (2) assign a relative
weight of 30 percent to a grant application if the applicant submits a signed
certification with his or her application. Section 3 provides that the applicant must
certify that if the applicant or the provider of broadband services will perform some
or all of the work or will subcontract some or all of the work to a licensed
contractor, the applicant, provider or contractor: (1) is able to provide certain
documentation upon request, meets certain safety and training requirements,
provides job opportunities with high-quality wages and employs a qualified local
workforce; or (2) is a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement that covers all
non-supervisory employees directly employed by the applicant who will perform
any work financed in whole or in part by the grant money.
Section 3 further requires each state agency to include as a condition of any
grant award that: (1) the certification provided by the applicant is binding upon the
applicant that is awarded the grant money; and (2) if an applicant, provider of
broadband services or contractor performs certain work that requires a contractor’s
license, certain provisions of law governing public works apply to the work
performed by the subcontractor. Lastly, section 3 authorizes any state agency that
awards a grant of federal money for the development of broadband services and
infrastructure pursuant to section 3 to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions
of section 3.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Chapter 232 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:

wave of federal money resulting from the passage of the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58, and
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Public Law 117-2, which
will help to close the digital divide and increase the development of
broadband services and infrastructure across the State;
2. The State of Nevada needs to ensure that this historic
investment creates long-lasting broadband infrastructure that is
built by a well-trained workforce;
3. Work performed by an unqualified contractor with a
poorly trained workforce endangers the public and is not in the
best interest of the citizens of this State; and
4. Proper stewardship of public money will require that the
State of Nevada implement appropriate measures to ensure that
any grants of federal money awarded by this State for the
development of broadband services and infrastructure prioritize
issuing grants to applicants that will ensure the work is performed
safely and by a well-trained workforce and that the applicant
provides quality jobs to Nevada workers.
Sec. 3. 1. In awarding any grant of federal money for the
development of broadband services and infrastructure in
accordance with federal law, each state agency shall:
(a) Evaluate and assign a score to each application for the
grant received by the state agency based on the factors and relative
weights assigned to each factor that the state agency specified in
the request for grant applications; and
(b) When ranking the proposals, assign a relative weight of 30
percent to an application if the applicant submits a signed
certification attesting that the applicant meets the requirements of
paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 2.
2. An applicant for a grant of federal money for the
development of broadband services and infrastructure shall
submit to a state agency with the application for the grant a signed
