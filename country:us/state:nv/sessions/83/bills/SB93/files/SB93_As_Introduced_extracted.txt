AN ACT relating to broadband; establishing certain requirements
for a state agency that awards grants of federal money for
the development of broadband services and infrastructure;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
2 the Office of the Governor and requires: (1) the Director of the Office to establish
3 and administer a program of infrastructure grants for the development or
4 improvement of broadband services for persons with low income and persons in
5 rural areas of this State; and (2) the Office to establish and administer a program to
6 encourage the deployment of broadband infrastructure in underserved communities
7 in this State. (NRS 223.600, 223.610, 223.670) Section 2 of this bill sets forth a
8 legislative declaration regarding the importance of using a well-trained workforce
9 and providing jobs to residents of this State in expending federal money to increase
10 the development of broadband services and infrastructure in this State.
11 Section 3 of this bill requires each state agency that awards grants of federal
12 money for the development of broadband services and infrastructure to: (1)
13 evaluate and assign a score to each grant application received by the state agency
14 based on the factors and relative weights assigned to each factor that the state
15 agency specified in the request for grant applications; and (2) assign a relative
16 weight of 30 percent to a grant application if the applicant submits a signed
17 certification with his or her application. Section 3 provides that the applicant must
18 certify that if the applicant or the provider of broadband services will perform some
19 or all of the work or will subcontract some or all of the work to a licensed
20 contractor, the applicant, provider or contractor: (1) meets certain safety and
21 training requirements and provides job opportunities with high-quality wages for
22 residents of this State and members of underrepresented communities; or (2) is a
23 signatory to a collective bargaining agreement that covers all non-supervisory
-
*SB93*
– 2 –
24 employees directly employed by the applicant who will perform any work financed
25 in whole or in part by the grant money.
26 Section 3 also provides that if an applicant or provider is a signatory to a
27 collective bargaining agreement, certain provisions of law requiring the payment of
28 prevailing wages on public works do not apply. Section 4 of this bill makes a
29 conforming change to provide an exception to the requirements to pay prevailing
30 wages on public works.
31 Section 3 further requires each state agency to include as a condition of any
32 grant award that: (1) the certification provided by the applicant is binding upon the
33 applicant that is awarded the grant money; and (2) if a licensed contractor performs
34 any work, certain provisions of law governing public works apply to the work
35 performed by the subcontractor. Lastly, section 3 authorizes the Director of the
36 Office to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of section 3.

8 will help to close the digital divide and increase the development of

10 2. The State of Nevada needs to ensure that this historic
11 investment creates long-lasting broadband infrastructure that is

17 State of Nevada implement appropriate measures to ensure that
18 any grants of federal money awarded by this State for the

20 issuing grants to applicants that will ensure the work is performed
21 safely and by a well-trained workforce and that the applicant
22 provides quality jobs to Nevada workers.
23 Sec. 3. 1. In awarding any grant of federal money for the
24 development of broadband services and infrastructure in
25 accordance with federal law, each state agency shall:

42 applicant, provider or contractor, as applicable, who will perform
43 any work financed in whole or in part with the grant money.

20 6. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting

24 would preclude or reduce federal assistance for that work.
25 7. The Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and
26 Technology established pursuant to NRS 223.600 may adopt
27 regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.
