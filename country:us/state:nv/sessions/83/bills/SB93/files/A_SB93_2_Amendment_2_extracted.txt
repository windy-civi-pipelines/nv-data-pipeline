EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to broadband; establishing certain requirements for a state agency
that awards grants of federal money for the development of broadband
services and infrastructure; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in the Office
2 of the Governor and requires: (1) the Director of the Office to establish and administer a
3 program of infrastructure grants for the development or improvement of broadband services
4 for persons with low income and persons in rural areas of this State; and (2) the Office to
5 establish and administer a program to encourage the deployment of broadband infrastructure
6 in underserved communities in this State. (NRS 223.600, 223.610, 223.670) Section 2 of this
7 bill sets forth a legislative declaration regarding the importance of using a well-trained
8 workforce and providing jobs to residents of this State in expending federal money to increase
9 the development of broadband services and infrastructure in this State.
10 Section 3 of this bill requires each state agency that awards grants of federal money for
11 the development of broadband services and infrastructure to: (1) evaluate and assign a score to
12 each grant application received by the state agency based on the factors and relative weights
13 assigned to each factor that the state agency specified in the request for grant applications; and
14 (2) assign a relative weight of 30 percent to a grant application if the applicant submits a
15 signed certification with his or her application. Section 3 provides that the applicant must
16 certify that if the applicant or the provider of broadband services will perform some or all of
17 the work or will subcontract some or all of the work to a licensed contractor, the applicant,
18 provider or contractor: (1) is able to provide certain documentation upon request, meets
19 certain safety and training requirements , [and] provides job opportunities with high-quality
20 wages [for residents of this State and members of underrepresented communities;] and
21 employs a qualified local workforce; or (2) is a signatory to a collective bargaining
22 agreement that covers all non-supervisory employees directly employed by the applicant who
23 will perform any work financed in whole or in part by the grant money.
24 [Section 3 also provides that if an applicant or provider is a signatory to a collective
25 bargaining agreement, certain provisions of law requiring the payment of prevailing wages on
26 public works do not apply. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide an
27 exception to the requirements to pay prevailing wages on public works.]
28 Section 3 further requires each state agency to include as a condition of any grant award
29 that: (1) the certification provided by the applicant is binding upon the applicant that is
30 awarded the grant money; and (2) if [a licensed] an applicant, provider of broadband
Senate Amendment No. 2 to Senate Bill No. 93 Page 4
31 services or contractor performs [any] certain work [,] that requires a contractor’s license,
32 certain provisions of law governing public works apply to the work performed by the
33 subcontractor. Lastly, section 3 authorizes any state agency that awards a grant of federal
34 money for the [Director] development of [the Office] broadband services and
35 infrastructure pursuant to section 3 to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of
36 section 3.
