AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the scope of the mandatory subjects
of collective bargaining to include the ratio of pupils per licensed

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the mandatory subjects of bargaining that are subject to
2 negotiation with a recognized employee organization for the purposes of a collective
3 bargaining agreement. (NRS 288.150) Section 1 of this bill revises the scope of mandatory
4 subjects of bargaining to include the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for each classroom
5 and the ratio of pupils per each type of specialized instructional support personnel in public
6 schools.
7 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to consider the
8 recommendations developed by the State Board of Education when establishing the ratio of
9 pupils per licensed teacher or specialized instructional support personnel in the school district.
10 (NRS 388.890) Section 2 of this bill creates an exception to this requirement for when a
11 school district is bound to a ratio of pupils per licensed teacher or specialized instructional
12 support personnel set by a collective bargaining agreement. Section 3 of this bill makes
13 conforming changes to a provision relating to the development of a plan to improve the set
14 ratio of pupils to specialized instructional support personnel in certain school districts.

11 without limitation:

13 (b) If the staff member of another public school consents, reassigning that
14 member of the staff of the other public school to such a school.

16 differs from or conflicts in any way with the provisions of subsection 9 or imposes
17 consequences on the board of trustees of a school district or the principal of a
18 school for taking any action authorized pursuant to subsection 9 is unenforceable
19 and void.
20 11. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
21 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils may use a
22 substantiated report of the abuse or neglect of a child or a violation of NRS
23 201.540, 201.553, 201.560, 392.4633 or 394.366 obtained from the Statewide
24 Central Registry for the Collection of Information Concerning the Abuse or Neglect
25 of a Child established by NRS 432.100 or an equivalent registry maintained by a

30 agreement negotiated pursuant to this chapter which conflicts with the provisions of
31 this subsection is unenforceable and void.
