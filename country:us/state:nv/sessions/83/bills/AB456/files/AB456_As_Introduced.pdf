EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring public utilities to
make notices to customers available in certain languages;
requiring the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to
adopt certain regulations relating to communications
between public utilities and customers; prohibiting a
public utility from disclosing information concerning
customers under certain circumstances; revising
provisions governing the circumstances under which a
public utility is prohibited from terminating gas, water or
electric service; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires a public utility, for any notice which is required
2 to be provided to a customer, to make such notice available in English and the three
3 languages other than English that are most commonly spoken in this State, except
4 to a customer who has designated the language in which the customer prefers to
5 receive communications. Section 2 requires the Public Utilities Commission of
6 Nevada to adopt regulations as necessary to ensure that customers of a public utility
7 who are persons with limited English proficiency or persons with a communication
8 disability are able to communicate and receive communications in a
9 comprehensible form from the public utilities in this State.
10 Existing regulations prohibit a public utility from providing any information
11 concerning its customers to any person for commercial purposes without the
12 approval of the Commission. (NAC 704.4051) Section 3 of this bill adds this
13 requirement to the Nevada Revised Statutes and additionally requires a public
14 utility to take reasonable steps to ensure that information concerning a customer of
15 a public utility which is disclosed to a third party will not be subject to further
16 disclosure.

17 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt or amend regulations that
18 govern the termination of utility service for gas, water or electricity, including
19 when a public utility is required to postpone the termination of utility service to a
20 residential customer. (NRS 704.1835) Existing regulations govern the termination
21 of such utility service. (NAC 704.350-704.380, inclusive) Section 4 of this bill
22 prohibits a public utility from terminating utility service for gas, water or electricity
23 to a residential customer because of nonpayment: (1) if the outstanding amount
24 owed by the customer is less than $300 or less than 6 months overdue; (2) if at least
25 half of the outstanding amount owed by the customer was paid within the
26 immediately preceding 25 days; (3) on a day, or on the day before a day, on which
27 the office of the utility that accepts or processes payments is closed; (4) without
28 first providing certain notice and information to the customer; and (5) without first
29 applying the amount of any security deposit of the customer towards the
30 outstanding amount. Section 4 prohibits a public utility from terminating electricity
31 service for a residential customer at any time from May 1 through October 31 of
32 each year. Section 4 prohibits a public utility from terminating gas service for a
33 residential customer during certain weather conditions.
34 Section 4 requires a public utility to notify each customer who is elderly or
35 who is a person with a disability that the customer may designate a third person to
36 receive notice of the pending termination of utility service of the customer. Section
37 4 requires a third person who is designated to receive such notice to receive a
38 duplicate of any written notice and information regarding the termination of utility
39 service for gas, water or electricity that is provided to the customer.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

8 spoken in this State, as determined by the Commission. If a
9 customer has designated the language in which he or she prefers

11 is not required to provide notice to that customer in a language
12 other than the preferred language designated by the customer.

18 public utilities in this State.
19 3. As used in this section:

10 from providing any person, including any other utility or
11 telecommunication provider, with information necessary to
12 provide utility services.
13 2. Except for disclosures made pursuant to NRS 704.197,
14 704.202 or 704.206, or a disclosure to which a customer consents

16 customer of a public utility to a third party, a public utility shall
17 take reasonable steps to ensure that such information will not be
18 subject to further disclosure.
19 Sec. 4. NRS 704.1835 is hereby amended to read as follows:

29 (a) Establish the criteria that will be used to determine when a
30 public utility is required to postpone its termination of utility service
31 to the residence of a residential customer who has failed to pay for
32 such service. Such criteria may be based in part upon the residential
33 customer’s ability to pay.
34 (b) Require a public utility to postpone its termination of utility
35 service to the residence of a residential customer who has failed to
36 pay for such service if the residential customer satisfies the criteria
37 established by the Commission and termination of the utility service
38 is reasonably likely to threaten the health of an occupant of the
39 residence of the residential customer.
40 [2.] 5. In addition to the regulations adopted pursuant to
41 subsection [1,] 4, for the purposes of regulating public utilities that
42 provide gas, water or electricity to landlords who pay for the utility

2 utility to terminate utility service because the landlord has failed to
3 pay for such service. Such notice must provide sufficient
4 information to allow residential tenants or their occupants to contact

6 likely to threaten the health of an occupant of the residence of a
7 residential tenant.

9 gas, water or electricity without complying with the provisions of
10 this section and the regulations adopted by the Commission
11 pursuant to this section.

15 may designate a third person to receive notice of the pending
16 termination of utility service of the customer. The utility shall give
17 the written notice:
18 (a) At the time the customer applies for service; or
19 (b) If the customer applies for service by telephone, at the time
20 the customer receives the first bill for service.
