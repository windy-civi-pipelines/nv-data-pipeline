Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes collective bargaining between: (1) local government
2 employers and local government employees; and (2) the State and certain state
3 employees. (Chapter 288 of NRS) This bill authorizes collective bargaining
4 between state professional employers and professional employees. Section 5 of this
5 bill defines “state professional employer” to mean a board, commission or similar
6 body within the Executive Department of the State Government, including, without
7 limitation, the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, that employs 400 or
8 more professional employees. Section 13 of this bill defines “professional
9 employee” to mean a person who, with various exceptions, is employed by a state
10 professional employer and who is: (1) in the unclassified service of the State; or (2)
11 paid in accordance with any arrangement other than the pay plan for the classified
12 service of the State.
13 Sections 2, 57 and 59 of this bill expand the powers and duties of the
14 Government Employee-Management Relations Board to include hearing and
15 deciding disputes between state professional employers and professional
16 employees.
17 Section 17 of this bill sets forth certain legislative findings and declarations.
18 Section 18 of this bill authorizes professional employees to organize, form, join
19 and assist professional organizations and engage in collective bargaining activity or
20 refrain from engaging in such activity. Sections 1 and 22 of this bill authorize an
21 officer of a state professional employer to, upon written authorization by a
22 professional employee, withhold money from the salary or wages of the employee
23 to pay dues or fees to a professional organization.
24 Section 19 of this bill provides for the recognition of a professional
25 organization by a state professional employer. Sections 19 and 58 of this bill set
26 forth the conditions under which a state professional employer is authorized to
27 withdraw such recognition. Section 23 of this bill: (1) authorizes a recognized
28 professional organization to, with certain limitations, represent a professional
29 employee with respect to any condition of the employment of the employee; and (2)
30 provides that only an exclusive representative may engage in collective bargaining
31 on behalf of the professional employees of the applicable bargaining unit.
32 Section 24 of this bill authorizes, with certain conditions, a professional
33 employee to act for himself or herself with respect to conditions of his or her
34 employment. Section 20 of this bill establishes certain rights of professional
35 organizations. Section 25 of this bill requires a professional employee who could
36 be subject to certain adverse employment actions to be afforded the right to be
37 represented unless the professional employee waives, in writing, that right.
38 Section 26 of this bill provides for the creation and organization of bargaining
39 units. Sections 27-31 of this bill set forth procedures for a professional organization
40 to be designated by the Board, either with or without an election, as an exclusive
41 representative of a bargaining unit. Sections 29 and 62 of this bill: (1) require the
42 Board to verify each showing of interest filed by a professional organization against
43 the employment records of the state professional employer; and (2) provide that a
44 showing of interest by a professional employee or a petition requesting an election
45 relating to exclusive representation submitted to the Board is confidential and not a
46 public record.
47 Section 32 of this bill requires each state professional employer that has
48 recognized one or more professional organizations and each professional
49 organization to file certain reports with the Board annually.
50 Section 33 of this bill sets forth certain subjects that constitute the scope of
51 mandatory bargaining. Section 34 of this bill requires negotiations between an
52 exclusive representative and a state professional employer to commence not later
53 than 60 calendar days after one party gives notice to the other party. Section 35 of
54 this bill sets forth certain duties of an exclusive representative. Section 36 of this
-

– 3 –
55 bill requires a state professional employer to designate a representative to engage in
56 collective bargaining with an exclusive representative. Section 36 further requires a
57 state professional employer to comply with reasonable requests to furnish certain
58 data to the exclusive representative. Section 39 of this bill authorizes a professional
59 organization to be represented by a licensed attorney in negotiations with a state
60 professional employer.
61 Sections 37, 38, 41 and 42 of this bill set forth various requirements and
62 limitations relating to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Section
63 64 of this bill provides that in the event of a conflict between certain policies and
64 procedures for personnel adopted by the Board of Regents of the University of
65 Nevada and the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of
66 the collective bargaining agreement prevail.
67 Section 40 of this bill requires any new or modified collective bargaining
68 agreement between a state professional employer and an exclusive representative to
69 be: (1) submitted to the members of the professional organization for a ratification
70 vote; and (2) approved at a public hearing by, depending on the state professional
71 employer, either the State Board of Examiners or the Board of Regents. Sections 46
72 and 63 of this bill provide that certain meetings convened for the purpose of
73 collective bargaining and resolving disputes relating to collective bargaining are
74 exempt from the provisions of existing law requiring open and public meetings of
75 public bodies.
76 Sections 43-45 of this bill provide for the mediation and arbitration of disputes
77 between state professional employers and exclusive representatives.
78 Section 47 of this bill prohibits certain practices in the context of collective
79 bargaining. Section 48 of this bill sets forth procedures to establish that a party has
80 committed such a prohibited practice.
81 Section 49 of this bill establishes certain provisions relating to actions brought
82 by or against state professional employers or professional organizations.
83 Existing law requires the Government Employee-Management Relations Board
84 to annually assess a fee on local government employers and the Executive
85 Department for the support of the Board based on the number of employees
86 employed by the local government employer or the Executive Department in the
87 first pay period of the immediately preceding year. (NRS 288.139, 288.475)
88 Section 50 of this bill requires the Board to assess a similar fee on each state
89 professional employer based on the number of professional employees in a
90 bargaining unit that had an exclusive representative in the first pay period of the
91 immediately preceding year.
92 Sections 51 and 52 of this bill authorize: (1) a state professional employer to
93 use the services of the Division of Human Resource Management of the
94 Department of Administration and the Attorney General to provide support to the
95 state professional employer to carry out the provisions of sections 6-52 of this bill;
96 and (2) the Division of Human Resource Management and the Attorney General to
97 charge the state professional employer for any such services provided.
98 Section 61 of this bill authorizes the Governor to request the drafting of as
99 many legislative measures as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections
100 6-52. Sections 56 and 60 of this bill revise provisions of existing law prohibiting
101 strikes against the State or a local government employer by an employee
102 organization or labor organization for the purpose of also prohibiting strikes by a
103 professional organization.
104 Sections 4, 5 and 7-16 of this bill define certain words and terms applicable to
105 the provisions of this bill. Sections 54 and 55 of this bill revise certain definitions
106 relating to collective bargaining that are applicable to employee organizations and
107 labor organizations to also include professional organizations. Section 53 of this
108 bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of sections 4 and

26 a professional organization other than the professional
27 organization that is the exclusive representative of the bargaining
28 unit.

44 designated by the Board as the exclusive representative of a
45 bargaining unit pursuant to sections 6 to 52, inclusive, of this act
-
*AB224_R2*

– 13 –
1 may engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the professional
2 employees of that bargaining unit.
3 Sec. 24. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
4 recognition of a professional organization or the designation of a
5 professional organization as an exclusive representative does not
6 preclude a professional employee from acting for himself or
7 herself with respect to any condition of his or her employment.
8 Such a professional employee has the right to present grievances
9 to a state professional employer at any time and to have those
10 grievances adjusted.
11 2. If a professional employee, acting for himself or herself,
12 presents a grievance to a state professional employer pursuant to
13 subsection 1:
14 (a) Any action taken in the adjustment of a grievance must be
15 consistent with the terms of an applicable collective bargaining

44 bargaining unit or bargaining units. The primary criterion for that

-
*AB224_R2*

– 14 –
1 employees concerned. Without restricting the rights of the parties
2 to make their determination pursuant to this subsection, for the

18 negotiating on behalf of two or more bargaining units may select
19 members of each unit to negotiate jointly on behalf of each other,
20 even if one of the units consists of supervisory employees and the
21 other unit does not.
22 5. If any professional organization is aggrieved by the
23 determination of a bargaining unit, it may appeal to the Board.
24 Subject to judicial review, the decision of the Board is binding
25 upon the state professional employer and any professional
26 organization involved. The Board shall apply the same criterion as
27 specified in subsection 1.
28 Sec. 27. If no professional organization is designated as the
29 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit and a recognized
30 professional organization files with the Board a showing of
31 interest for the professional organization by more than 50 percent

34 shall designate the professional organization as the exclusive
35 representative of the bargaining unit without ordering an election.
36 Sec. 28. 1. If no professional organization is designated as
37 the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit, the Board shall

12 50 percent of the professional employees within the bargaining
13 unit; or
14 (2) A group of professional employees within the
15 bargaining unit files with the Board a written request for an
16 election which includes a petition or other evidence showing that
17 more than 50 percent of the professional employees within the
18 bargaining unit have requested that an election be conducted to
19 change or discontinue exclusive representation;
20 (b) If applicable, the written request filed pursuant to
21 paragraph (a) is filed at least 225 calendar days but not more than
22 270 calendar days before the date on which the current collective
23 bargaining agreement in effect for the bargaining unit expires;

26 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
27 information that is not otherwise confidential.
28 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
29 has legal custody or control of a public record:

32 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
33 medium.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
35 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

30 physicians engaged in a program for residency training and
31 postdoctoral fellows of the System and which are separate from the
32 policies and procedures established for the unclassified personnel of
33 the System. Any such policy or procedure does not diminish the
34 eligibility of those persons for coverage as employees under the
35 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
36 NRS.
37 2. Except as otherwise provided in sections 6 to 52, inclusive,
