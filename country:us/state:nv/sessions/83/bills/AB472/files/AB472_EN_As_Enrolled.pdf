Assembly Bill No. 472–Committee on Education
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting a school district from
contracting or partnering with persons or entities who charge
more than a certain amount of fees and costs related to the
employment of certain visa holders; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
governing body of a charter school to employ a teacher or instructor authorized to
teach in the United States under the teacher exchange programs authorized by laws
of the Congress of the United States. (NRS 391.070) A J-1 visa is a nonimmigrant
visa available to a foreign national who is a student, scholar, trainee, teacher,
professor, research assistant, specialist or leader in a field of specialized knowledge
or skill and who is coming temporarily to the United States for certain purposes,
including, without limitation, teaching. (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J)) An H-1B visa is
a nonimmigrant visa available to a foreign national who is coming to the United
States for the purpose of practicing a specialty occupation. (8 U.S.C. §
1101(a)(15)(H), § 1184(i)(1)) Section 2 of this bill prohibits a school district that
employs, or intends to employ, a J-1 visa holder through a teacher exchange
program from entering into a contract or partnering with a person or entity that is a
sponsor of such a program or that recruits candidates for such a program if the total
amount of the fees and costs charged per person who participates in, or applies to
be a candidate for, the program exceeds $10,000. Section 4 of this bill provides that
this prohibition does not apply to a contract or partnership existing on July 1, 2025,
but does apply to any renewal or extension of such a contract or partnership after
that date.
