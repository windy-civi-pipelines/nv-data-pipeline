Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
2 a charter school to employ a teacher or instructor authorized to teach in the United States
3 under the teacher exchange programs authorized by laws of the Congress of the United States.
4 (NRS 391.070) A J-1 visa is a nonimmigrant visa available to a foreign national who is a
5 student, scholar, trainee, teacher, professor, research assistant, specialist or leader in a field of
6 specialized knowledge or skill and who is coming temporarily to the United States for certain
7 purposes, including, without limitation, teaching. (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J)) An H-1B visa is
8 a nonimmigrant visa available to a foreign national who is coming to the United States for the
9 purpose of practicing a specialty occupation. (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H), § 1184(i)(1))
10 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a school district that employs, or intends to employ, a J-1 visa
11 holder through a teacher exchange program from entering into a contract or partnering with a
12 person or entity that is a sponsor of such a program or that recruits candidates for such a
13 program if the total amount of the fees and costs charged per person who participates in, or
14 applies to be a candidate for, the program exceeds $10,000. Section 4 of this bill provides that
15 this prohibition does not apply to a contract or partnership existing on July 1, 2025, but does
16 apply to any renewal or extension of such a contract or partnership after that date.
17 [Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Education to establish a grant program
18 whereby the board of trustees of a school district may apply for a grant of money to defray the
19 costs of sponsoring an applicant for an H-1B visa or a permanent resident card. Section 3
20 additionally authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to apply for such a grant of
21 money if: (1) the applicant seeking sponsorship is currently a J-1 visa holder and employed by

Assembly Amendment No. 863 to Assembly Bill No. 472 Page 4
22 the school district; and (2) the J-1 visa held by the employee will expire not more than 1 year
23 after the date on which the application to receive a grant pursuant to section 3 is submitted.
24 Finally, section 3 requires the Department to adopt certain regulations concerning the grant
25 program.]
