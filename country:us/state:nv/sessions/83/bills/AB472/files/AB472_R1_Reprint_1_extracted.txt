1 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the

3 teach in the United States under the teacher exchange programs authorized by laws
4 of the Congress of the United States. (NRS 391.070) A J-1 visa is a nonimmigrant
5 visa available to a foreign national who is a student, scholar, trainee, teacher,
6 professor, research assistant, specialist or leader in a field of specialized knowledge
7 or skill and who is coming temporarily to the United States for certain purposes,
8 including, without limitation, teaching. (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(J)) An H-1B visa is
9 a nonimmigrant visa available to a foreign national who is coming to the United
10 States for the purpose of practicing a specialty occupation. (8 U.S.C. §
11 1101(a)(15)(H), § 1184(i)(1)) Section 2 of this bill prohibits a school district that
12 employs, or intends to employ, a J-1 visa holder through a teacher exchange
13 program from entering into a contract or partnering with a person or entity that is a
14 sponsor of such a program or that recruits candidates for such a program if the total
15 amount of the fees and costs charged per person who participates in, or applies to
16 be a candidate for, the program exceeds $10,000. Section 4 of this bill provides that
17 this prohibition does not apply to a contract or partnership existing on July 1, 2025,
18 but does apply to any renewal or extension of such a contract or partnership after
19 that date.
