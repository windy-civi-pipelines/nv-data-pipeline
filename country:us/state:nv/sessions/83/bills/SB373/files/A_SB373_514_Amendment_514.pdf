5 bodies of a city to enter into an agreement to establish a multijurisdictional business license
6 for certain contractors. (NRS 244.33501, 268.0951) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require
7 [each] , in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County),

10 jurisdictional business license and [sets] set forth certain requirements for such [a model] an
11 ordinance, including requiring the [model] ordinance to establish [: (1)] the [proposed
12 boundaries of the region in which the regional business license is valid; and (2)] proposed
13 categories of businesses for which a [regional] multi-jurisdictional business license will be
14 issued.
15 Sections 1 and 2 also require [each] the board of county commissioners and each
16 governing body of an incorporated city to: (1) cooperate with [each other] the board of county
17 commissioners and each governing body of an incorporated city in the [proposed region]
18 county to [determine whether the boards and governing bodies should] enter into an
19 agreement to establish such a [regional] multi-jurisdictional business license for any
20 specified category of business; and (2) consider certain factors relating to the similarity of any
21 existing county or city requirements for such businesses when [determining whether to enter]

25 establish by ordinance a system for issuing the [regional] multi-jurisdictional business
