1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners of a county or
2 governing body of a city to regulate all character of lawful trades, callings,
3 industries, occupations, professions and business conducted within its county or
4 city, as applicable. (NRS 244.335, 266.355, 268.095) Existing law also requires
5 certain boards of county commissioners and governing bodies of a city to enter into
6 an agreement to establish a multijurisdictional business license for certain
7 contractors. (NRS 244.33501, 268.0951) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require, in a
8 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the
9 board of county commissioners and each governing body of an incorporated city in
10 the county to adopt an ordinance for the establishment of a multi-jurisdictional
11 business license and set forth certain requirements for such an ordinance, including
12 requiring the ordinance to establish the proposed categories of businesses for which
13 a multi-jurisdictional business license will be issued.
14 Sections 1 and 2 also require the board of county commissioners and each
15 governing body of an incorporated city to: (1) cooperate with the board of county
16 commissioners and each governing body of an incorporated city in the county to
17 enter into an agreement to establish such a multi-jurisdictional business license for
18 any specified category of business; and (2) consider certain factors relating to the
19 similarity of any existing county or city requirements for such businesses when
20 entering into such an agreement. Lastly, sections 1 and 2 require that each board
21 and governing body shall: (1) establish by ordinance a system for issuing the multi-
22 jurisdictional business license; and (2) integrate the application for the multi-
23 jurisdictional business license with the state business portal.
