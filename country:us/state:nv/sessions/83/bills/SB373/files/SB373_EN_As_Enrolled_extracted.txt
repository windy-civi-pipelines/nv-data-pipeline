Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners of a county or

industries, occupations, professions and business conducted within its county or
city, as applicable. (NRS 244.335, 266.355, 268.095) Existing law also requires
certain boards of county commissioners and governing bodies of a city to enter into
an agreement to establish a multijurisdictional business license for certain

county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the
board of county commissioners and each governing body of an incorporated city in
the county to adopt an ordinance for the establishment of a multi-jurisdictional
business license and set forth certain requirements for such an ordinance, including
requiring the ordinance to establish the proposed categories of businesses for which
a multi-jurisdictional business license will be issued.

Section 2:
Sections 1 and 2 also require the board of county commissioners and each
governing body of an incorporated city to: (1) cooperate with the board of county
commissioners and each governing body of an incorporated city in the county to
enter into an agreement to establish such a multi-jurisdictional business license for
any specified category of business; and (2) consider certain factors relating to the
similarity of any existing county or city requirements for such businesses when
entering into such an agreement. Lastly, sections 1 and 2 require that each board
and governing body shall: (1) establish by ordinance a system for issuing the multi-
jurisdictional business license; and (2) integrate the application for the multi-
jurisdictional business license with the state business portal.
