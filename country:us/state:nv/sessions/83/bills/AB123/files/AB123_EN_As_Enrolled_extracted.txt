Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that a person is guilty of harassment if he or she, without
lawful authority, knowingly makes certain threats and, by words or conduct, places
the person threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. Existing
law further provides that a person who is guilty of harassment is: (1) for the first
offense, guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense,
guilty of a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.571)

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill prohibits a person from directly or indirectly addressing
any threat or intimidation to a candidate for public office if the person: (1) knows or
has reason to know that the threat or intimidation communicates the intent, either
immediately or in the future, to cause or induce another to cause bodily injury to
the candidate or another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family
member of the candidate or physical damage to the property of the candidate or
another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family member of the
candidate; and (2) addresses the threat or intimidation in a manner which places the
person who receives the threat or intimidation in reasonable fear that the threat or
intimidation will be carried out. Section 2 further provides that a person who
violates the provisions of section 2 is: (1) for the first offense, guilty of a
misdemeanor; and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross
misdemeanor.

Section 3:
Section 3 of this bill authorizes a candidate who believes that he or she is the
subject of a threat or intimidation that violates the provisions of section 2 to notify
the Secretary of State in writing of the alleged violation. Upon receipt of such
notice, section 3 requires the Secretary of State to conduct an investigation and, if
the Secretary of State determines that reasonable suspicion exists that a violation
has occurred, requires the Secretary of State to, as soon as practicable, refer the
matter to the Attorney General for a determination of whether to institute
proceedings to enforce the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further requires the
Secretary of State to, after the conclusion of such an investigation, issue to the
candidate who notified the Secretary of State of the threat or intimidation a written
report that includes: (1) a description of the alleged violation; (2) the results of the
investigation undertaken; and (3) if applicable, the outcome of the referral of the
matter to the Attorney General.
