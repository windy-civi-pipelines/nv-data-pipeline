AN ACT relating to elections communications; prohibiting a person

intimidate a candidate for public office; authorizing a
candidate to notify the Secretary of State of a violation of
such a prohibition; requiring the Secretary of State to take
certain actions upon the receipt of such notice; providing

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person is guilty of harassment if he or she, without
2 lawful authority, knowingly makes certain threats and, by words or conduct, places
3 the person threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. Existing
4 law further provides that a person who is guilty of harassment is: (1) for the first
5 offense, guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense,
6 guilty of a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.571)
7 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a person from directly or indirectly addressing
8 any threat or intimidation to a candidate for public office if the person: (1) knows or
9 has reason to know that the threat or intimidation communicates the intent, either
10 immediately or in the future, to cause or induce another to cause bodily injury to
11 the candidate or another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family
12 member of the candidate or physical damage to the property of the candidate or

13 another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family member of the
14 candidate; and (2) addresses the threat or intimidation in a manner which places the
15 person who receives the threat or intimidation in reasonable fear that the threat or
16 intimidation will be carried out. Section 2 further provides that a person who
17 violates the provisions of section 2 is: (1) for the first offense, guilty of a
18 misdemeanor; and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross
19 misdemeanor.
20 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a candidate who believes that he or she is the
21 subject of a threat or intimidation that violates the provisions of section 2 to notify
22 the Secretary of State in writing of the alleged violation. Upon receipt of such
23 notice, section 3 requires the Secretary of State to conduct an investigation and, if
24 the Secretary of State determines that reasonable suspicion exists that a violation
25 has occurred, requires the Secretary of State to, as soon as practicable, refer the
26 matter to the Attorney General for a determination of whether to institute
27 proceedings to enforce the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further requires the
28 Secretary of State to, after the conclusion of such an investigation, issue to the
29 candidate who notified the Secretary of State of the threat or intimidation a written
30 report that includes: (1) a description of the alleged violation; (2) the results of the
31 investigation undertaken; and (3) if applicable, the outcome of the referral of the
32 matter to the Attorney General.
