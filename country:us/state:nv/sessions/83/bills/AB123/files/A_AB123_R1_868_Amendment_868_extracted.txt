office; authorizing a [person] candidate to notify the Secretary of State
of a violation of such a prohibition; requiring the Secretary of State to
take certain actions upon the receipt of such notice; providing

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person is guilty of harassment if he or she, without lawful
2 authority, knowingly makes certain threats and, by words or conduct, places the person
3 threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. Existing law further provides
4 that a person who is guilty of harassment is: (1) for the first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor;
5 and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
6 200.571)
7 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a person from directly or indirectly addressing any threat
8 or intimidation to a candidate for public office if the person : (1) knows or has reason to know
9 that the threat or intimidation communicates the intent, either immediately or in the future, to
10 cause or induce another to cause [: (1)] bodily injury to the candidate or another who the
11 person knows or has reason to know is a family member of the candidate [;] or [(2)] physical
12 damage to the property of the candidate or another who the person knows or has reason to
13 know is a family member of the candidate [.] ; and (2) addresses the threat or intimidation
14 in a manner which places the person who receives the threat or intimidation in
15 reasonable fear that the threat or intimidation will be carried out. Section 2 further
16 provides that a person who violates the provisions of section 2 is: (1) for the first offense,
17 guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross
18 misdemeanor.
19 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a [person] candidate who believes that he or she is the
20 subject of a threat or intimidation that violates the provisions of section 2 [have been
Assembly Amendment No. 868 to Assembly Bill No. 123 First Reprint Page 4
21 violated] to notify the Secretary of State in writing of the alleged violation. Upon receipt of
22 such notice, section 3 requires the Secretary of State to conduct an investigation and, if the
23 Secretary of State determines that reasonable suspicion exists that a violation has occurred,
24 requires the Secretary of State to, as soon as practicable, refer the matter to the Attorney
25 General for a determination of whether to institute proceedings to enforce the provisions of
26 section 2. Section 3 further requires the Secretary of State to, [within 30 days] after the
27 [receipt] conclusion of [a notice of] such an [alleged violation,] investigation, issue [a
28 written report] to the candidate who [is] notified the [subject] Secretary of State of the threat
29 or intimidation a written report that includes: (1) a description of the alleged violation; (2)
30 the results of the investigation undertaken; and (3) [whether] if applicable, the [Secretary]
