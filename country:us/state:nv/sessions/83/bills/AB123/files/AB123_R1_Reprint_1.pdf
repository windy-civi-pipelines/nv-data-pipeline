AN ACT relating to elections communications; prohibiting a person
from making certain statements which threaten or
intimidate a candidate for public office; authorizing a
person to notify the Secretary of State of a violation of
such a prohibition; requiring the Secretary of State to take
certain actions upon the receipt of such notice; providing

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person is guilty of harassment if he or she, without
2 lawful authority, knowingly makes certain threats and, by words or conduct, places
3 the person threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. Existing
4 law further provides that a person who is guilty of harassment is: (1) for the first
5 offense, guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense,
6 guilty of a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.571)
7 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a person from directly or indirectly addressing
8 any threat or intimidation to a candidate for public office if the person knows or has
9 reason to know that the threat or intimidation communicates the intent, either
10 immediately or in the future, to cause or induce another to cause: (1) bodily injury
11 to the candidate or another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family
12 member of the candidate; or (2) physical damage to the property of the candidate or

13 another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family member of the
14 candidate. Section 2 further provides that a person who violates the provisions of
15 section 2 is: (1) for the first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2) for the
16 second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
17 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person who believes that the provisions of
18 section 2 have been violated to notify the Secretary of State in writing of the
19 alleged violation. Upon receipt of such notice, section 3 requires the Secretary of
20 State to conduct an investigation and, if the Secretary of State determines that
21 reasonable suspicion exists that a violation has occurred, requires the Secretary of
22 State to, as soon as practicable, refer the matter to the Attorney General for a
23 determination of whether to institute proceedings to enforce the provisions of
24 section 2. Section 3 further requires the Secretary of State to, within 30 days after
25 the receipt of a notice of an alleged violation, issue a written report to the candidate
26 who is the subject of the threat or intimidation that includes: (1) a description of the
27 alleged violation; (2) the results of the investigation undertaken; and (3) whether
28 the Secretary of State referred the matter to the Attorney General.
