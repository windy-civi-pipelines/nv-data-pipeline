EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections communications; prohibiting a person [, during any
speech or other communication made in the course of his or her
political campaign,] from making certain statements which threaten
[the life of any other] or intimidate a candidate for public office;
authorizing a person [;] to notify the Secretary of State of a
violation of such a prohibition; requiring the Secretary of State to
take certain actions upon the receipt of such notice; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [The United States Supreme Court has held that: (1) a “true threat” is an unprotected
2 category of communication which subjects a person to the fear of violence and to the many
3 kinds of disruption that fear engenders; and (2) the First Amendment of the United States
4 Constitution requires a speaker who communicates a true threat to act recklessly when making
5 such a statement. (Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U.S. 66, 74-81 (2023)) The Supreme Court
6 has further held that a person acts recklessly when he or she “consciously disregards a
7 substantial and unjustifiable risk that the conduct will cause harm to another.” (Counterman,
8 600 U.S. at 79 (quoting Voisine v. U.S., 579 U.S. 686, 691 (2016))]
9 Existing law provides that a person is guilty of harassment if he or she, without lawful
10 authority, knowingly makes certain threats and, by words or conduct, places the person
11 threatened in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. Existing law further provides
12 that a person who is guilty of harassment is: (1) for the first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor;
13 and (2) for the second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
14 200.571)
15 [This] Section 2 of this bill prohibits a person from, [during any speech] directly or
16 [other communication made in] indirectly addressing any threat or intimidation to a
Assembly Amendment No. 104 to Assembly Bill No. 123 Page 4
17 candidate for public office if the [course of his] person knows or [her political campaign,
18 threatening] has reason to know that the [life of any other person:] threat or intimidation
19 communicates the intent, either immediately or in the future, to cause or induce another
20 to cause: (1) [with conscious disregard for the substantial and unjustifiable risk] bodily
21 injury to the candidate or another who the person who knows or has reason to know is a
22 family member of [harm to another caused by his or her speech] the candidate; or
23 [communication; and] (2) [in a manner which places the person who is] physical damage to
24 the [subject] property of the [threat in reasonable fear that the threat will be carried out. This
25 bill] candidate or another who the person knows or has reason to know is a family
26 member of the candidate. Section 2 further provides that a person who violates the
27 provisions of [this bill] section 2 is: (1) for the first offense, guilty of a misdemeanor; and (2)
28 for the second or any subsequent offense, guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
29 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person who believes that the provisions of section 2
30 have been violated to notify the Secretary of State in writing of the alleged violation.
31 Upon receipt of such notice, section 3 requires the Secretary of State to conduct an
32 investigation and, if the Secretary of State determines that reasonable suspicion exists
33 that a violation has occurred, requires the Secretary of State to, as soon as practicable,
34 refer the matter to the Attorney General for a determination of whether to institute
35 proceedings to enforce the provisions of section 2. Section 3 further requires the
36 Secretary of State to, within 30 days after the receipt of a notice of an alleged violation,
37 issue a written report to the candidate who is the subject of the threat or intimidation
38 that includes: (1) a description of the alleged violation; (2) the results of the investigation
39 undertaken; and (3) whether the Secretary of State referred the matter to the Attorney
40 General.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

2 section to read as follows:] the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.

7 communicates the [life of any other person:] intent, either immediately or in the
8 future, to cause or induce another to cause:
