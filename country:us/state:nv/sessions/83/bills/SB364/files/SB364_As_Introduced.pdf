EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing certain qualified
businesses in this State to apply to the Office of Economic
Development for a partial abatement from certain taxes
imposed in connection with the development of railroad
tracks, railroad spurs and other railroad-related
infrastructure; prescribing certain requirements and
conditions relating to the partial abatement; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to grant a partial
2 abatement of property taxes, business taxes or sales and use taxes to a business that
3 locates or expands in this State and meets certain qualifications for the partial
4 abatement. (NRS 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754,
5 701A.210) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the owner of a business or a person who
6 intends to locate or expand a business in this State to apply to the Office for a
7 partial abatement of property taxes or local sales and use taxes, or an abatement of
8 modified business taxes, imposed with respect to the construction, operation,
9 manufacture, reconstruction, maintaining, repairing or laying of railroad tracks,
10 railroad spurs and other physical infrastructure in this State necessary to provide
11 rail service. Section 1 requires the Office to approve a partial abatement for a
12 period of not more than 10 years if the Office makes certain determinations
13 regarding the applicant, including that the applicant: (1) has entered into an
14 agreement with the Office addressing certain matters; (2) will provide certain
15 wages and other benefits to the applicant’s employees; (3) will increase the number
16 of full-time employees employed by the applicant in this State; and (4) will make
17 certain new capital investments or maintain and possess tangible personal property
18 in this State which exceeds a specified value.

19 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Taxation to, during certain
20 investigations of a person claiming an abatement of taxes pursuant to section 1,
21 investigate whether the person meets the requirements for eligibility for the
22 abatement. Section 3 of this bill requires the agreement between a business granted
23 an abatement pursuant to section 1 and the Office to include an agreement: (1) to
24 allow the Department of Taxation to audit the business in order to assess whether
25 the business is in full compliance of the requirements for the abatement; and (2) to
26 the public disclosure of an audit report, under certain conditions.
27 Section 4 of this bill requires that the Office take any action on an application
28 for a partial abatement of taxes pursuant to section 1 at a public meeting conducted
29 for that purpose after providing notice of the public meeting not less than 30 days
30 before the meeting. Section 5 of this bill requires the Office to issue a document to
31 a business whose application for a partial abatement of sales and use taxes has been
32 approved that: (1) can be presented to retailers who are responsible for collecting
33 sales and use taxes; and (2) clearly states the rate of sales and use tax that the
34 business is required to pay to the retailer.
35 Existing law requires the Office to biennially prepare and submit to the
36 Legislature a report containing certain information relating to the abatements from
37 taxation that the Office has approved. (NRS 231.0685) Section 7 of this bill
38 requires that information relating to partial abatements approved by the Office
39 pursuant to section 1 be included in such reports.
40 Existing law enacts the Nevada New Markets Jobs Act, which entitles certain
41 businesses to receive credit against certain taxes in exchange for investing in a
42 qualified community development entity, which in turn must make certain capital
43 or equity investments in, or loans to, qualified active low-income community
44 businesses. (Chapter 231A of NRS) Existing law provides that a business that has
45 received certain abatements from taxation from the Office is not a “qualified active
46 low-income community business” for purposes of the Nevada New Markets Jobs
47 Act, unless the business has waived the abatement and meets certain other
48 qualifications. (NRS 231A.155, 231A.170) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill provide
49 that a business that has received a partial tax abatement pursuant to section 1 is not
50 a qualified active low-income community business, unless the business waives the
51 abatement and meets certain other qualifications.
52 Existing law requires the Office to periodically conduct an analysis of the
53 relative costs and benefits of each incentive for economic development, including
54 any abatement from taxes, approved by the Office and in effect during the
55 immediately preceding 2 fiscal years. (NRS 353.207) Section 10 of this bill
56 requires the Office to perform such an analysis for the partial abatements approved
57 pursuant to section 1.
58 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 5-11 of this bill
59 expire by limitation on June 30, 2045, to comply with the requirement of the
60 Nevada Constitution that the Legislature must provide a specific expiration date for
61 certain tax exemptions. (Nev. Const. Art. 10, § 6) Accordingly, section 6 of this bill
62 exempts section 1 from provisions of law providing that any legislation which
63 requires or authorizes the Office to approve any abatement of taxes expires 10 years
64 after the effective date of such legislation. (NRS 218D.355)

8 tax paid for which the business was entitled to an abatement. If the
