AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing certain qualified businesses in this State
to apply to the Office of Economic Development for a partial
abatement from certain taxes imposed in connection with the
development of railroad tracks, railroad spurs and other railroad-related
infrastructure; prescribing certain requirements and conditions relating
to the partial abatement; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to grant a partial abatement
2 of property taxes, business taxes or sales and use taxes to a business that locates or expands in
3 this State and meets certain qualifications for the partial abatement. (NRS 274.310, 274.320,
4 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 701A.210) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the owner of
5 a business or a person who intends to locate or expand a business in this State to apply to the
6 Office for a partial abatement of property taxes or local sales and use taxes, or an abatement of
7 modified business taxes, imposed with respect to the construction, operation, manufacture,
8 reconstruction, maintaining, repairing or laying of railroad tracks, railroad spurs and other
9 physical infrastructure in this State necessary to provide rail service. Section 1 requires the
10 Office to approve a partial abatement for a period of not more than 10 years if the Office
11 makes certain determinations regarding the applicant, including that the applicant: (1) has
12 entered into an agreement with the Office addressing certain matters; (2) will provide certain
13 wages and other benefits to the applicant’s employees; (3) will increase the number of full-
14 time employees employed by the applicant in this State; and (4) will make certain new capital
15 investments or maintain and possess tangible personal property in this State which exceeds a
16 specified value.
17 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Taxation to, during certain investigations
18 of a person claiming an abatement of taxes pursuant to section 1, investigate whether the
19 person meets the requirements for eligibility for the abatement. Section 3 of this bill requires
20 the agreement between a business granted an abatement pursuant to section 1 and the Office
21 to include an agreement: (1) to allow the Department of Taxation to audit the business in order
22 to assess whether the business is in full compliance of the requirements for the abatement; and
23 (2) to the public disclosure of an audit report, under certain conditions.
24 Section 4 of this bill requires that the Office take any action on an application for a partial
25 abatement of taxes pursuant to section 1 at a public meeting conducted for that purpose after
Senate Amendment No. 363 to Senate Bill No. 364 Page 4
26 providing notice of the public meeting not less than 30 days before the meeting. Section 5 of
27 this bill requires the Office to issue a document to a business whose application for a partial
28 abatement of sales and use taxes has been approved that: (1) can be presented to retailers who
29 are responsible for collecting sales and use taxes; and (2) clearly states the rate of sales and
30 use tax that the business is required to pay to the retailer.
31 Existing law requires the Office to biennially prepare and submit to the Legislature a
32 report containing certain information relating to the abatements from taxation that the Office
33 has approved. (NRS 231.0685) Section 7 of this bill requires that information relating to
34 partial abatements approved by the Office pursuant to section 1 be included in such reports.
35 Existing law enacts the Nevada New Markets Jobs Act, which entitles certain businesses
36 to receive credit against certain taxes in exchange for investing in a qualified community
37 development entity, which in turn must make certain capital or equity investments in, or loans
38 to, qualified active low-income community businesses. (Chapter 231A of NRS) Existing law
39 provides that a business that has received certain abatements from taxation from the Office is
40 not a “qualified active low-income community business” for purposes of the Nevada New
41 Markets Jobs Act, unless the business has waived the abatement and meets certain other
42 qualifications. (NRS 231A.155, 231A.170) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill provide that a
43 business that has received a partial tax abatement pursuant to section 1 is not a qualified
44 active low-income community business, unless the business waives the abatement and meets
45 certain other qualifications.
46 Existing law requires the Office to periodically conduct an analysis of the relative costs
47 and benefits of each incentive for economic development, including any abatement from
48 taxes, approved by the Office and in effect during the immediately preceding 2 fiscal years.
49 (NRS 353.207) Section 10 of this bill requires the Office to perform such an analysis for the
50 partial abatements approved pursuant to section 1.
51 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 5-11 of this bill expire by
52 limitation on June 30, 2045, to comply with the requirement of the Nevada Constitution that
53 the Legislature must provide a specific expiration date for certain tax exemptions. (Nev.
54 Const. Art. 10, § 6) Accordingly, section 6 of this bill exempts section 1 from provisions of
55 law providing that any legislation which requires or authorizes the Office to approve any
56 abatement of taxes expires 10 years after the effective date of such legislation. (NRS
57 218D.355)

5 sales and use tax paid for which the business was entitled to an abatement. If the
6 Department has issued to a business a document pursuant to subsection 1 and the

(BDR 32-799)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing certain qualified businesses in this State
to apply to the Office of Economic Development for a partial
abatement from certain taxes imposed in connection with the
development of railroad tracks, railroad spurs and other railroad-related
infrastructure; prescribing certain requirements and conditions relating
to the partial abatement; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to grant a partial abatement
2 of property taxes, business taxes or sales and use taxes to a business that locates or expands in
3 this State and meets certain qualifications for the partial abatement. (NRS 274.310, 274.320,
4 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 701A.210) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the owner of
5 a business or a person who intends to locate or expand a business in this State to apply to the
6 Office for a partial abatement of property taxes or local sales and use taxes, or an abatement of
7 modified business taxes, imposed with respect to the construction, operation, manufacture,
8 reconstruction, maintaining, repairing or laying of railroad tracks, railroad spurs and other
9 physical infrastructure in this State necessary to provide rail service. Section 1 requires the
10 Office to approve a partial abatement for a period of not more than 10 years if the Office
11 makes certain determinations regarding the applicant, including that the applicant: (1) has
12 entered into an agreement with the Office addressing certain matters; (2) will provide certain
13 wages and other benefits to the applicant’s employees; (3) will increase the number of full-
14 time employees employed by the applicant in this State; and (4) will make certain new capital
15 investments or maintain and possess tangible personal property in this State which exceeds a
16 specified value.
17 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Taxation to, during certain investigations
18 of a person claiming an abatement of taxes pursuant to section 1, investigate whether the
19 person meets the requirements for eligibility for the abatement. Section 3 of this bill requires
20 the agreement between a business granted an abatement pursuant to section 1 and the Office
21 to include an agreement: (1) to allow the Department of Taxation to audit the business in order
22 to assess whether the business is in full compliance of the requirements for the abatement; and
23 (2) to the public disclosure of an audit report, under certain conditions.
24 Section 4 of this bill requires that the Office take any action on an application for a partial
25 abatement of taxes pursuant to section 1 at a public meeting conducted for that purpose after

Senate Amendment No. 363 to Senate Bill No. 364 Page 4
26 providing notice of the public meeting not less than 30 days before the meeting. Section 5 of
27 this bill requires the Office to issue a document to a business whose application for a partial
28 abatement of sales and use taxes has been approved that: (1) can be presented to retailers who
29 are responsible for collecting sales and use taxes; and (2) clearly states the rate of sales and
30 use tax that the business is required to pay to the retailer.
31 Existing law requires the Office to biennially prepare and submit to the Legislature a
32 report containing certain information relating to the abatements from taxation that the Office
33 has approved. (NRS 231.0685) Section 7 of this bill requires that information relating to
34 partial abatements approved by the Office pursuant to section 1 be included in such reports.
35 Existing law enacts the Nevada New Markets Jobs Act, which entitles certain businesses
36 to receive credit against certain taxes in exchange for investing in a qualified community
37 development entity, which in turn must make certain capital or equity investments in, or loans
38 to, qualified active low-income community businesses. (Chapter 231A of NRS) Existing law
39 provides that a business that has received certain abatements from taxation from the Office is
40 not a “qualified active low-income community business” for purposes of the Nevada New
41 Markets Jobs Act, unless the business has waived the abatement and meets certain other
42 qualifications. (NRS 231A.155, 231A.170) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill provide that a
43 business that has received a partial tax abatement pursuant to section 1 is not a qualified
44 active low-income community business, unless the business waives the abatement and meets
45 certain other qualifications.
46 Existing law requires the Office to periodically conduct an analysis of the relative costs
47 and benefits of each incentive for economic development, including any abatement from
48 taxes, approved by the Office and in effect during the immediately preceding 2 fiscal years.
49 (NRS 353.207) Section 10 of this bill requires the Office to perform such an analysis for the
50 partial abatements approved pursuant to section 1.
51 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 5-11 of this bill expire by
52 limitation on June 30, 2045, to comply with the requirement of the Nevada Constitution that
53 the Legislature must provide a specific expiration date for certain tax exemptions. (Nev.
54 Const. Art. 10, § 6) Accordingly, section 6 of this bill exempts section 1 from provisions of
55 law providing that any legislation which requires or authorizes the Office to approve any
56 abatement of taxes expires 10 years after the effective date of such legislation. (NRS
57 218D.355)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
