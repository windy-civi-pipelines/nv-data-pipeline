EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a hospital or psychiatric
hospital from employing a physician under certain
circumstances; providing penalties for a violation of such
prohibition; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the staffing of hospitals,
2 psychiatric hospitals and certain other health care facilities. (NRS 449.241-
3 449.2428) In 2010, the Attorney General issued an opinion explaining that, while it
4 is the longstanding practice in Nevada that a physician generally works as a
5 contractor for, rather than an employee of, a hospital, there is no provision of law
6 prohibiting a hospital from employing a physician. (Att’y Gen. Op. 2010-04
7 (March 5, 2010)) Section 1 of this bill expressly prohibits a hospital or psychiatric
8 hospital from employing a physician for the purpose of practicing medicine,
9 homeopathic medicine or osteopathic medicine except where expressly authorized
10 by law.
11 Existing law authorizes a county hospital or hospital district, a private nonprofit
12 medical school, a nonprofit medical research institution or certain mental health
13 facilities operated by divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services to
14 employ a physician under certain circumstances. (NRS 433.264, 433B.150,
15 450.180, 450.640, 630.365) Section 1 additionally authorizes a hospital or
16 psychiatric hospital to employ a physician: (1) who is participating in certain
17 graduate programs; or (2) if the hospital or psychiatric hospital is owned or
18 operated by the State Government.
19 Existing law exempts a medical facility from certain requirements of existing
20 law relating to the licensing and regulation of medical facilities if the facility: (1) is
21 conducted by and for the adherents of any church or religious denomination for the
22 purpose of providing care and treatment in accordance with the practices of
23 the religion of the church or denomination; or (2) is operated and maintained by the
-

– 2 –
24 United States Government or an agency thereof. (NRS 449.0301) Section 2 of this
25 bill exempts these facilities from the provisions of section 1.
26 Existing law authorizes certain penalties to be imposed against certain medical
27 facilities that violate certain laws and regulations governing the operation of such
28 medical facilities. (NRS 449.160, 449.163, 449.220, 449.240) Sections 3 and 4 of
29 this bill apply these same penalties to a hospital or psychiatric hospital that violates
30 section 1. Section 3 authorizes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
31 Department of Health and Human Services to suspend or revoke the license of a
32 hospital or psychiatric hospital that violates section 1. Section 4 authorizes the
33 Division to impose certain other penalties on a hospital or psychiatric hospital that
34 violates section 1, including an administrative penalty of not more than $5,000 per
35 day for each violation, together with interest at a rate not to exceed 10 percent per
36 year.
37 Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) authorize the
38 Division to bring action to enjoin any person from operating or maintaining any
39 hospital or psychiatric hospital that violates section 1; (2) requires the district
40 attorney of the county where the hospital or psychiatric hospital is located to
41 prosecute such an action upon application by the Division; and (3) apply the
42 definitions of certain terms to section 1.
