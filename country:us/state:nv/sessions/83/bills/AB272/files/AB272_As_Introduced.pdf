EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to forensic medical examinations; repealing,
replacing and revising certain provisions relating to the
payment of and reimbursement for forensic medical
examinations of certain victims of crime; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a county in whose jurisdiction a sexual assault is
2 committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for a forensic medical
3 examination of the victim; and (2) provides that such costs must not be charged
4 directly to the victim. (NRS 217.300) Similarly, existing law: (1) requires a county
5 in whose jurisdiction a domestic violence battery by strangulation is committed to
6 pay any costs incurred by a hospital for a strangulation forensic medical
7 examination of the victim; and (2) provides that such costs must not be charged
8 directly to the victim. (NRS 217.405)
9 Sections 3 and 13 of this bill remove and repeal the provisions of existing law
10 requiring the costs incurred by a hospital for a forensic medical examination of a
11 victim of sexual assault or domestic violence battery by strangulation to be paid by
12 the county. Instead, section 1 of this bill establishes procedures by which a health
13 care facility may be reimbursed by the Department of Health and Human Services
14 for any costs incurred by the health care facility for the forensic medical
15 examination of a victim of sexual assault, domestic violence, battery which is
16 committed by strangulation or certain offenses related to human trafficking.
17 Additionally, section 1 prohibits the health care facility from directly charging the
18 victims for the costs of such a forensic medical examination. Sections 2 and 4-12
19 of this bill make conforming changes necessary to implement the new procedures
20 for reimbursement.
