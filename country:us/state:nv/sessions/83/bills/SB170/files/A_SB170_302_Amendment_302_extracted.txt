EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter or volunteer
firefighter to submit to an annual cancer screening for certain industrial
insurance coverage for cancer; revising provisions governing the
administration of physical examinations required of certain firefighters,
arson investigators and police officers for certain industrial insurance
coverage for lung disease and heart disease; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising out of and
2 in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive compensation under
3 industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law provides that certain diseases of the
4 lungs and heart contracted by certain firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters
5 and police officers are occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to
6 compensation under certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
7 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
8 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which depends on
9 the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457) Sections 2-4 of this bill
10 revise requirements for the administering of such a physical examination. Section 2: (1)
11 requires such a physical examination to be administered , when possible, by a licensed
12 physician or advanced practice registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical
13 demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and
14 examinations that such a physical examination must include.
15 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer firefighters or
16 certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or death is an
17 occupational disease and compensable under industrial insurance under certain circumstances.
18 (NRS 617.453) Section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter or volunteer firefighter to submit to
19 a cancer screening [upon employment,] upon commencement of coverage , [and] thereafter on
20 an annual basis during his or her employment [.] and, if provided by the employer, upon
21 employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the administration of such a cancer
22 screening.

46 preclude any person from demonstrating, on a case-by-case basis for the purposes
47 of paragraph (b) of subsection 1, that a substance is a known carcinogen or is
48 reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen, including an agent classified by
49 the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Group 1 or Group 2A, that is
50 reasonably associated with a disabling cancer.

2 surgery and hospitalization in accordance with the schedule of fees and charges
3 established pursuant to NRS 616C.260 or, if the insurer has contracted with an
4 organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
5 616B.527, the amount that is allowed for the treatment or other services under that
6 contract; and
7 (b) The compensation provided in chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, of NRS

9 5. For a person who has been employed in this State as a firefighter,
10 investigator, instructor or officer described in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of
11 subsection 1, or has acted as a volunteer firefighter in this State as described in
12 subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, disabling cancer is rebuttably
13 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment of the person if
14 the disease is diagnosed during the course of the person’s employment described in
15 paragraph (a) of subsection 1.
16 6. For a person who has been employed in this State as a firefighter,
17 investigator, instructor or officer described in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of

19 firefighter in this State as described in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of
20 subsection 1, regardless of the date on which the volunteer firefighter retires,
21 disabling cancer is rebuttably presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of
22 the person’s employment pursuant to this subsection. This rebuttable presumption
23 applies to disabling cancer diagnosed after the termination of the person’s
24 employment if the diagnosis occurs within a period, not to exceed 60 months,
25 which begins with the last date the employee actually worked in the qualifying
26 capacity and extends for a period calculated by multiplying 3 months by the
27 number of full years of his or her employment.
28 7. For a person who has been employed in this State as a firefighter,
29 investigator, instructor or officer described in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of
30 subsection 1 and who retires on or after July 1, 2019, disabling cancer is rebuttably
31 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the person’s employment
32 pursuant to this subsection. This rebuttable presumption applies to disabling cancer
33 diagnosed:
34 (a) If the person ceases employment before completing 20 years of service as a
35 firefighter, investigator, instructor or officer, during the period after separation from
36 employment which is equal to the number of years worked; or
37 (b) If the person ceases employment after completing 20 years or more of
38 service as a firefighter, investigator, instructor or officer, at any time during the
39 person’s life.
40 8. Service credit which is purchased in a retirement system must not be used
41 to calculate the number of years of service or employment of a person for the
42 purposes of this section.
43 9. A rebuttable presumption created by subsection 5, 6 or 7 must control the
44 awarding of benefits pursuant to this section unless evidence to rebut the
45 presumption is presented. The provisions of subsections 5, 6 and 7 do not create a
46 conclusive presumption.
47 10. A person who files a claim for a disabling cancer pursuant to subsection 7
48 after he or she retires from employment as a firefighter, investigator of fires or
49 arson, or instructor or officer for the provision of training concerning fire or
50 hazardous materials is not entitled to receive any compensation for that disease
51 other than medical benefits.

38 firefighter who is 50 years of age or older shall submit to a physical examination
39 once every 2 years during his or her employment. [As used in this subsection,
40 “physical examination” includes the making of an X-ray film of the volunteer
41 firefighter’s lungs but excludes a thorough test of the functioning of his or her
42 lungs.]
43 4. All physical examinations required pursuant to subsections 2 and 3 must be

6 6. Frequent or regular use of a tobacco product within 1 year, or a material
7 departure from a physician’s prescribed plan of care by a person within 3 months,
8 immediately preceding the filing of a claim for compensation excludes a person
9 who has separated from service from the benefit of the conclusive presumption
10 provided in subsection 5.
11 7. Failure to correct predisposing conditions which lead to lung disease when
12 so ordered in writing by the examining physician after a physical examination

16 (a) Partially disabled from an occupational disease pursuant to the provisions
17 of this section; and
18 (b) Incapable of performing, with or without remuneration, work as a
19 firefighter, police officer or arson investigator,
20  may elect to receive the benefits provided under NRS 616C.440 for a permanent
21 total disability.
22 9. A person who files a claim for a disease of the lungs specified in this
23 section after he or she retires from employment as a police officer, firefighter or
24 arson investigator is not entitled to receive any compensation for that disease other
25 than medical benefits.
26 10. The Administrator shall review a claim filed by a claimant pursuant to this
27 section that has been in the appeals process for longer than 6 months to determine
28 the circumstances causing the delay in processing the claim. As used in this
29 subsection, “appeals process” means the period of time that:
30 (a) Begins on the date on which the claimant first files or submits a request for
31 a hearing or an appeal of a determination regarding the claim; and

34 11. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an employer, insurer or
35 third-party administrator denies a claim that was filed pursuant to this section and
36 the claimant ultimately prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer

43 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the employer, insurer or third-party
44 administrator, as applicable, shall pay to the claimant all medical costs which are
45 associated with the occupational disease and are incurred from the date on which
46 the hearing is requested until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to a final
47 decision. If the employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable,
48 ultimately prevails, the employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable,
49 is entitled to recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance with
50 the provisions of NRS 616C.138.

Senate Amendment No. 302 to Senate Bill No. 170 Page 12
1 continuous, uninterrupted and salaried occupation as a firefighter, arson
2 investigator or police officer in this State before the date of disablement are
3 conclusively presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment if
4 the disease is diagnosed and causes the disablement:
5 (a) During the course of that employment;
6 (b) If the person ceases employment before completing 20 years of service as a
7 police officer, firefighter or arson investigator, during the period after separation
8 from employment which is equal to the number of years worked; or
9 (c) If the person ceases employment after completing 20 years or more of
10 service as a police officer, firefighter or arson investigator, at any time during the
11 person’s life.
12  Service credit which is purchased in a retirement system must not be calculated
13 towards the years of service of a person for the purposes of this section.
14 2. Frequent or regular use of a tobacco product within 1 year, or a material
15 departure from a physician’s prescribed plan of care by a person within 3 months,
16 immediately preceding the filing of a claim for compensation excludes a person
17 who has separated from service from the benefit of the conclusive presumption
18 provided in subsection 1.
19 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, diseases of the heart,
20 resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or death, are occupational
21 diseases and compensable as such under the provisions of this chapter if caused by
22 extreme overexertion in times of stress or danger and a causal relationship can be
23 shown by competent evidence that the disability or death arose out of and was
24 caused by the performance of duties as a volunteer firefighter by a person entitled
25 to the benefits of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, of NRS pursuant to the
26 provisions of NRS 616A.145 and who, for 5 years or more, has served continuously
27 as a volunteer firefighter in this State by continuously maintaining an active status
28 on the roster of a volunteer fire department.
29 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, each employee who is to be
30 covered for diseases of the heart pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
31 submit to a physical examination [, including an examination of the heart,] upon
32 employment, upon commencement of coverage and thereafter on an annual basis
33 during his or her employment.
34 5. During the period in which a volunteer firefighter is continuously on active
35 status on the roster of a volunteer fire department, a physical examination for the
36 volunteer firefighter is required:
37 (a) Upon employment;
38 (b) Upon commencement of coverage; and
39 (c) Once every 3 years after the physical examination that is required pursuant
40 to paragraph (b),
41  until the firefighter reaches the age of 50 years. Each volunteer firefighter who is
42 50 years of age or older shall submit to a physical examination once every 2 years
43 during his or her employment.
44 6. The employer of the volunteer firefighter is responsible for scheduling the
45 physical examination. The employer shall mail to the volunteer firefighter a written
46 notice of the date, time and place of the physical examination at least 10 days
47 before the date of the physical examination and shall obtain, at the time of mailing,
48 a certificate of mailing issued by the United States Postal Service.
49 7. Failure to submit to a physical examination that is scheduled by his or her
50 employer pursuant to subsection 6 excludes the volunteer firefighter from the
51 benefits of this section.
52 8. The chief of a volunteer fire department may require an applicant to pay for
53 any physical examination required pursuant to this section if the applicant:
Senate Amendment No. 302 to Senate Bill No. 170 Page 13

2 (b) Is 50 years of age or older on the date of his or her application.
3 9. The volunteer fire department shall reimburse an applicant for the cost of a
4 physical examination required pursuant to this section if the applicant:

6 (b) Is declared physically fit to perform the duties required of a firefighter; and
7 (c) Becomes a volunteer with the volunteer fire department.
8 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, all physical examinations
9 required pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 must be paid for by the employer.
10 11. Failure to correct predisposing conditions which lead to heart disease
11 when so ordered in writing by the examining physician subsequent to a physical
12 examination required pursuant to subsection 4 or 5 excludes the employee from the
13 benefits of this section if the correction is within the ability of the employee.
14 12. A person who is determined to be:
15 (a) Partially disabled from an occupational disease pursuant to the provisions
16 of this section; and
17 (b) Incapable of performing, with or without remuneration, work as a
18 firefighter, arson investigator or police officer,
19  may elect to receive the benefits provided under NRS 616C.440 for a permanent
20 total disability.
21 13. Claims filed under this section may be reopened at any time during the
22 life of the claimant for further examination and treatment of the claimant upon
23 certification by a physician of a change of circumstances related to the occupational
24 disease which would warrant an increase or rearrangement of compensation.
25 14. A person who files a claim for a disease of the heart specified in this
26 section after he or she retires from employment as a firefighter, arson investigator
27 or police officer is not entitled to receive any compensation for that disease other
28 than medical benefits.
29 15. The Administrator shall review a claim filed by a claimant pursuant to this

34 a hearing or an appeal of a determination regarding the claim; and
35 (b) Continues until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to a final
36 decision.
37 16. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an employer, insurer or
38 third-party administrator denies a claim that was filed pursuant to this section and
39 the claimant ultimately prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer
40 or third-party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit penalty
41 of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which an appeal is filed until
42 the date on which the claim is adjudicated to a final decision. Such benefit penalty
43 is payable in addition to any benefits to which the claimant is entitled under the
44 claim and any fines and penalties imposed by the Administrator pursuant to NRS
45 616D.120. If a hearing before a hearing officer is requested pursuant to NRS
46 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the employer, insurer or third-party
47 administrator, as applicable, shall pay to the claimant all medical costs which are
48 associated with the occupational disease and are incurred from the date on which
49 the hearing is requested until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to a final
50 decision. If the employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable,
51 ultimately prevails, the employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable,
52 is entitled to recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance with

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 2)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter or volunteer
firefighter to submit to an annual cancer screening for certain industrial
insurance coverage for cancer; revising provisions governing the
administration of physical examinations required of certain firefighters,
arson investigators and police officers for certain industrial insurance
coverage for lung disease and heart disease; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising out of and
2 in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive compensation under
3 industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law provides that certain diseases of the
4 lungs and heart contracted by certain firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters
5 and police officers are occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to
6 compensation under certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
7 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
8 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which depends on
9 the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457) Sections 2-4 of this bill
10 revise requirements for the administering of such a physical examination. Section 2: (1)
11 requires such a physical examination to be administered , when possible, by a licensed
12 physician or advanced practice registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical
13 demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and
14 examinations that such a physical examination must include.
15 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer firefighters or
16 certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or death is an
17 occupational disease and compensable under industrial insurance under certain circumstances.
18 (NRS 617.453) Section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter or volunteer firefighter to submit to
19 a cancer screening [upon employment,] upon commencement of coverage , [and] thereafter on
20 an annual basis during his or her employment [.] and, if provided by the employer, upon
21 employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the administration of such a cancer
22 screening.

11 subsection 1, or has acted as a volunteer firefighter in this State as described in
12 subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, disabling cancer is rebuttably
13 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment of the person if
14 the disease is diagnosed during the course of the person’s employment described in
15 paragraph (a) of subsection 1.
16 6. For a person who has been employed in this State as a firefighter,

21 disabling cancer is rebuttably presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of
22 the person’s employment pursuant to this subsection. This rebuttable presumption
23 applies to disabling cancer diagnosed after the termination of the person’s
24 employment if the diagnosis occurs within a period, not to exceed 60 months,
25 which begins with the last date the employee actually worked in the qualifying
26 capacity and extends for a period calculated by multiplying 3 months by the

38 service as a firefighter, investigator, instructor or officer, at any time during the
39 person’s life.
40 8. Service credit which is purchased in a retirement system must not be used
41 to calculate the number of years of service or employment of a person for the
42 purposes of this section.
43 9. A rebuttable presumption created by subsection 5, 6 or 7 must control the
44 awarding of benefits pursuant to this section unless evidence to rebut the
45 presumption is presented. The provisions of subsections 5, 6 and 7 do not create a
46 conclusive presumption.
47 10. A person who files a claim for a disabling cancer pursuant to subsection 7
48 after he or she retires from employment as a firefighter, investigator of fires or
49 arson, or instructor or officer for the provision of training concerning fire or
50 hazardous materials is not entitled to receive any compensation for that disease
51 other than medical benefits.
