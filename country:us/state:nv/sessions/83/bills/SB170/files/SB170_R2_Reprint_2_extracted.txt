(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter who
is not employed by the Executive Department of the State
Government or volunteer firefighter to submit to an
annual cancer screening for certain industrial insurance
coverage for cancer; revising provisions governing the
administration of physical examinations required of
certain firefighters, arson investigators and police officers
who are not employed by the Executive Department of
the State Government for certain industrial insurance
coverage for lung disease and heart disease; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising
2 out of and in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive
3 compensation under industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law
4 provides that certain diseases of the lungs and heart contracted by certain
5 firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters and police officers are
6 occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to compensation under
7 certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
8 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
9 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which
10 depends on the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
11 Sections 2-4 of this bill revise requirements for the administering of such a physical
12 examination for an employee who is not an employee in the Executive Department
13 of the State Government. Effective July 1, 2026, section 2: (1) requires such a
14 physical examination to be administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or
-
*SB170_R2*
– 2 –
15 advanced practice registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical
16 demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and
17 examinations that such a physical examination must include.
18 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer
19 firefighters or certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent
20 disability or death is an occupational disease and compensable under industrial
21 insurance under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.453) Effective July 1, 2026,
22 section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter, other than a firefighter who is an
23 employee in the Executive Department of the State Government, or volunteer
24 firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon commencement of coverage,
25 thereafter on an annual basis during his or her employment and, if provided by the
26 employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the
27 administration of such a cancer screening.

15 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, or has acted as a
16 volunteer firefighter in this State as described in subparagraph (2) of
17 paragraph (a) of subsection 1, disabling cancer is rebuttably

30 after the termination of the person’s employment if the diagnosis
31 occurs within a period, not to exceed 60 months, which begins with

5 employee from the benefits of this section if the correction is within
6 the ability of the employee.
7 8. A person who is determined to be:
8 (a) Partially disabled from an occupational disease pursuant to
9 the provisions of this section; and
10 (b) Incapable of performing, with or without remuneration, work
11 as a firefighter, police officer or arson investigator,
12  may elect to receive the benefits provided under NRS 616C.440
13 for a permanent total disability.
14 9. A person who files a claim for a disease of the lungs
15 specified in this section after he or she retires from employment as a
16 police officer, firefighter or arson investigator is not entitled to
17 receive any compensation for that disease other than medical
18 benefits.
19 10. The Administrator shall review a claim filed by a claimant
20 pursuant to this section that has been in the appeals process for
21 longer than 6 months to determine the circumstances causing the
22 delay in processing the claim. As used in this subsection, “appeals
23 process” means the period of time that:
24 (a) Begins on the date on which the claimant first files or
25 submits a request for a hearing or an appeal of a determination
26 regarding the claim; and
27 (b) Continues until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
28 a final decision.
29 11. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an
30 employer, insurer or third-party administrator denies a claim that
31 was filed pursuant to this section and the claimant ultimately
32 prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer or third-
33 party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit
34 penalty of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which
35 an appeal is filed until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
36 a final decision. Such benefit penalty is payable in addition to any
37 benefits to which the claimant is entitled under the claim and any
38 fines and penalties imposed by the Administrator pursuant to NRS
39 616D.120. If a hearing before a hearing officer is requested pursuant
40 to NRS 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the
41 employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, shall
42 pay to the claimant all medical costs which are associated with the
43 occupational disease and are incurred from the date on which the
44 hearing is requested until the date on which the claim is adjudicated
45 to a final decision. If the employer, insurer or third-party
-

– 13 –
1 administrator, as applicable, ultimately prevails, the employer,
2 insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, is entitled to
3 recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance
4 with the provisions of NRS 616C.138.
5 Sec. 4. NRS 617.457 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 617.457 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
7 chapter, diseases of the heart of a person who, for 2 years or more,
8 has been employed in a full-time continuous, uninterrupted and
9 salaried occupation as a firefighter, arson investigator or police
10 officer in this State before the date of disablement are conclusively
11 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment
12 if the disease is diagnosed and causes the disablement:
13 (a) During the course of that employment;
14 (b) If the person ceases employment before completing 20 years
15 of service as a police officer, firefighter or arson investigator, during
16 the period after separation from employment which is equal to the
17 number of years worked; or
18 (c) If the person ceases employment after completing 20 years
19 or more of service as a police officer, firefighter or arson
20 investigator, at any time during the person’s life.
21  Service credit which is purchased in a retirement system must not
22 be calculated towards the years of service of a person for the
23 purposes of this section.
24 2. Frequent or regular use of a tobacco product within 1 year,
25 or a material departure from a physician’s prescribed plan of care by
26 a person within 3 months, immediately preceding the filing of a
27 claim for compensation excludes a person who has separated from
28 service from the benefit of the conclusive presumption provided in
29 subsection 1.
30 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, diseases
31 of the heart, resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or
32 death, are occupational diseases and compensable as such under the
33 provisions of this chapter if caused by extreme overexertion in times
34 of stress or danger and a causal relationship can be shown by
35 competent evidence that the disability or death arose out of and was
36 caused by the performance of duties as a volunteer firefighter by a
37 person entitled to the benefits of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive,
38 of NRS pursuant to the provisions of NRS 616A.145 and who, for 5
39 years or more, has served continuously as a volunteer firefighter in
40 this State by continuously maintaining an active status on the roster
41 of a volunteer fire department.
42 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, each
43 employee who is to be covered for diseases of the heart pursuant to
44 the provisions of this section shall submit to a physical examination
45 [, including an examination of the heart,] upon employment, upon
-
*SB170_R2*
– 14 –
1 commencement of coverage and thereafter on an annual basis during
2 his or her employment. If the employee is an employee in the
3 Executive Department of the State Government, the physical
4 examination must include an examination of the heart.
5 5. During the period in which a volunteer firefighter is
6 continuously on active status on the roster of a volunteer fire
7 department, a physical examination for the volunteer firefighter is
8 required:
9 (a) Upon employment;
10 (b) Upon commencement of coverage; and
11 (c) Once every 3 years after the physical examination that is
12 required pursuant to paragraph (b),
13  until the firefighter reaches the age of 50 years. Each volunteer
14 firefighter who is 50 years of age or older shall submit to a physical
15 examination once every 2 years during his or her employment.
16 6. The employer of the volunteer firefighter is responsible for
17 scheduling the physical examination. The employer shall mail to the
18 volunteer firefighter a written notice of the date, time and place of
19 the physical examination at least 10 days before the date of the
20 physical examination and shall obtain, at the time of mailing, a
21 certificate of mailing issued by the United States Postal Service.
22 7. Failure to submit to a physical examination that is scheduled
23 by his or her employer pursuant to subsection 6 excludes the
24 volunteer firefighter from the benefits of this section.
25 8. The chief of a volunteer fire department may require an
26 applicant to pay for any physical examination required pursuant to
27 this section if the applicant:
28 (a) Applies to the department for the first time as a volunteer
29 firefighter; and
30 (b) Is 50 years of age or older on the date of his or her
31 application.
32 9. The volunteer fire department shall reimburse an applicant
33 for the cost of a physical examination required pursuant to this
34 section if the applicant:
35 (a) Paid for the physical examination in accordance with
36 subsection 8;
37 (b) Is declared physically fit to perform the duties required of a
38 firefighter; and
39 (c) Becomes a volunteer with the volunteer fire department.
40 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, all physical
41 examinations required pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 must be paid
42 for by the employer.
43 11. Failure to correct predisposing conditions which lead to
44 heart disease when so ordered in writing by the examining physician
45 or advanced practice registered nurse, as applicable, subsequent to
-
*SB170_R2*
– 15 –
1 a physical examination required pursuant to subsection 4 or 5
2 excludes the employee from the benefits of this section if the
3 correction is within the ability of the employee.
4 12. A person who is determined to be:
5 (a) Partially disabled from an occupational disease pursuant to
6 the provisions of this section; and
7 (b) Incapable of performing, with or without remuneration, work
8 as a firefighter, arson investigator or police officer,
9  may elect to receive the benefits provided under NRS 616C.440
10 for a permanent total disability.
11 13. Claims filed under this section may be reopened at any
12 time during the life of the claimant for further examination and
13 treatment of the claimant upon certification by a physician of a
14 change of circumstances related to the occupational disease which
15 would warrant an increase or rearrangement of compensation.
16 14. A person who files a claim for a disease of the heart
17 specified in this section after he or she retires from employment as a
18 firefighter, arson investigator or police officer is not entitled to
19 receive any compensation for that disease other than medical
20 benefits.
21 15. The Administrator shall review a claim filed by a claimant
22 pursuant to this section that has been in the appeals process for
23 longer than 6 months to determine the circumstances causing the
24 delay in processing the claim. As used in this subsection, “appeals
25 process” means the period of time that:
26 (a) Begins on the date on which the claimant first files or
27 submits a request for a hearing or an appeal of a determination
28 regarding the claim; and
29 (b) Continues until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
30 a final decision.
31 16. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an
32 employer, insurer or third-party administrator denies a claim that
33 was filed pursuant to this section and the claimant ultimately
34 prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer or third-
35 party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit
36 penalty of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which
37 an appeal is filed until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
38 a final decision. Such benefit penalty is payable in addition to any
39 benefits to which the claimant is entitled under the claim and any
40 fines and penalties imposed by the Administrator pursuant to NRS
41 616D.120. If a hearing before a hearing officer is requested pursuant
42 to NRS 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the
43 employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, shall
44 pay to the claimant all medical costs which are associated with the
45 occupational disease and are incurred from the date on which the
-
*SB170_R2*
– 16 –
1 hearing is requested until the date on which the claim is adjudicated
2 to a final decision. If the employer, insurer or third-party
3 administrator, as applicable, ultimately prevails, the employer,
4 insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, is entitled to
5 recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance
6 with the provisions of NRS 616C.138.
7 Sec. 5. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
8 additional expenses of a local government that are related to the
9 provisions of this act.
10 Sec. 6. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2026.

SECOND REPRINT S.B. 170
SENATE BILL NO. 170–SENATORS STEINBECK AND SCHEIBLE
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to industrial insurance.
(BDR 53-632)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 2)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter who
is not employed by the Executive Department of the State
Government or volunteer firefighter to submit to an
annual cancer screening for certain industrial insurance
coverage for cancer; revising provisions governing the
administration of physical examinations required of
certain firefighters, arson investigators and police officers
who are not employed by the Executive Department of
the State Government for certain industrial insurance
coverage for lung disease and heart disease; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising
2 out of and in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive
3 compensation under industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law
4 provides that certain diseases of the lungs and heart contracted by certain
5 firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters and police officers are
6 occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to compensation under
7 certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
8 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
9 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which
10 depends on the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
11 Sections 2-4 of this bill revise requirements for the administering of such a physical
12 examination for an employee who is not an employee in the Executive Department
13 of the State Government. Effective July 1, 2026, section 2: (1) requires such a
14 physical examination to be administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or
-
*SB170_R2*

– 2 –
15 advanced practice registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical
16 demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and
17 examinations that such a physical examination must include.
18 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer
19 firefighters or certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent
20 disability or death is an occupational disease and compensable under industrial
21 insurance under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.453) Effective July 1, 2026,
22 section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter, other than a firefighter who is an
23 employee in the Executive Department of the State Government, or volunteer
24 firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon commencement of coverage,
25 thereafter on an annual basis during his or her employment and, if provided by the
26 employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the
27 administration of such a cancer screening.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
