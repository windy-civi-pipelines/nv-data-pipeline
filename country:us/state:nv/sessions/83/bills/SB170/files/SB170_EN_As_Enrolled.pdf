Senate Bill No. 170–Senators Steinbeck and Scheible
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter who
is not employed by the Executive Department of the State
Government or volunteer firefighter to submit to an annual
cancer screening for certain industrial insurance coverage for
cancer; revising provisions governing the administration of
physical examinations required of certain firefighters, arson
investigators and police officers who are not employed by the
Executive Department of the State Government for certain
industrial insurance coverage for lung disease and heart
disease; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising
out of and in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive
compensation under industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law
provides that certain diseases of the lungs and heart contracted by certain
firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters and police officers are
occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to compensation under
certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which
depends on the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
Sections 2-4 of this bill revise requirements for the administering of such a physical
examination for an employee who is not an employee in the Executive Department
of the State Government. Effective July 1, 2026, section 2: (1) requires such a
physical examination to be administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or
advanced practice registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical
demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and
examinations that such a physical examination must include.
Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer
firefighters or certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent
disability or death is an occupational disease and compensable under industrial
insurance under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.453) Effective July 1, 2026,
section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter, other than a firefighter who is an
employee in the Executive Department of the State Government, or volunteer
firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon commencement of coverage,
thereafter on an annual basis during his or her employment and, if provided by the
employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the
administration of such a cancer screening.

must control the awarding of benefits pursuant to this section unless
evidence to rebut the presumption is presented. The provisions of
subsections 5, 6 and 7 do not create a conclusive presumption.
10. A person who files a claim for a disabling cancer pursuant

Government, or acting as a volunteer firefighter and who is to be

party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit
penalty of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which

recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance
with the provisions of NRS 616C.138.
