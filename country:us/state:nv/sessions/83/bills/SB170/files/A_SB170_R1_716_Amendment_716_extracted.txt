EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter who is not
employed by the Executive Department of the State Government or
volunteer firefighter to submit to an annual cancer screening for certain
industrial insurance coverage for cancer; revising provisions governing
the administration of physical examinations required of certain
firefighters, arson investigators and police officers who are not
employed by the Executive Department of the State Government
for certain industrial insurance coverage for lung disease and heart
disease; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising out of and
2 in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive compensation under
3 industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law provides that certain diseases of the
4 lungs and heart contracted by certain firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters
5 and police officers are occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to
6 compensation under certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
7 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
8 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which depends on
9 the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457) Sections 2-4 of this bill
10 revise requirements for the administering of such a physical examination [.] for an employee
11 who is not an employee in the Executive Department of the State Government. [Section]
12 Effective July 1, 2026, section 2: (1) requires such a physical examination to be
13 administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or advanced practice registered nurse
14 who is knowledgeable about the physical demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and
15 (2) sets forth various tests and examinations that such a physical examination must include.
16 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer firefighters or
17 certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or death is an
18 occupational disease and compensable under industrial insurance under certain circumstances.
19 (NRS 617.453) [Section] Effective July 1, 2026, section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter ,
20 other than a firefighter who is an employee in the Executive Department of the State
21 Government, or volunteer firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon commencement of
22 coverage, thereafter on an annual basis during his or her employment and, if provided by the
Senate Amendment No. 716 to Senate Bill No. 170 First Reprint Page 4
23 employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the administration
24 of such a cancer screening.

12 5. For a person who has been employed in this State as a firefighter,
13 investigator, instructor or officer described in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of
14 subsection 1, or has acted as a volunteer firefighter in this State as described in
15 subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, disabling cancer is rebuttably
16 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment of the person if
17 the disease is diagnosed during the course of the person’s employment described in
18 paragraph (a) of subsection 1.
19 6. For a person who has been employed in this State as a firefighter,

24 disabling cancer is rebuttably presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of
25 the person’s employment pursuant to this subsection. This rebuttable presumption
26 applies to disabling cancer diagnosed after the termination of the person’s
27 employment if the diagnosis occurs within a period, not to exceed 60 months,
28 which begins with the last date the employee actually worked in the qualifying
29 capacity and extends for a period calculated by multiplying 3 months by the

32 investigator, instructor or officer described in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of

34 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the person’s employment
35 pursuant to this subsection. This rebuttable presumption applies to disabling cancer
36 diagnosed:

38 firefighter, investigator, instructor or officer, during the period after separation from
39 employment which is equal to the number of years worked; or
40 (b) If the person ceases employment after completing 20 years or more of
41 service as a firefighter, investigator, instructor or officer, at any time during the
42 person’s life.
43 8. Service credit which is purchased in a retirement system must not be used
44 to calculate the number of years of service or employment of a person for the
45 purposes of this section.
46 9. A rebuttable presumption created by subsection 5, 6 or 7 must control the
47 awarding of benefits pursuant to this section unless evidence to rebut the
48 presumption is presented. The provisions of subsections 5, 6 and 7 do not create a
49 conclusive presumption.
50 10. A person who files a claim for a disabling cancer pursuant to subsection 7
51 after he or she retires from employment as a firefighter, investigator of fires or
52 arson, or instructor or officer for the provision of training concerning fire or
Senate Amendment No. 716 to Senate Bill No. 170 First Reprint Page 7
1 hazardous materials is not entitled to receive any compensation for that disease
2 other than medical benefits.

35 diseases and compensable as such under the provisions of this chapter if caused by
36 extreme overexertion in times of stress or danger and a causal relationship can be
37 shown by competent evidence that the disability or death arose out of and was
38 caused by the performance of duties as a volunteer firefighter by a person entitled
39 to the benefits of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, of NRS pursuant to the
40 provisions of NRS 616A.145 and who, for 5 years or more, has served continuously
41 as a volunteer firefighter in this State by continuously maintaining an active status

44 covered for diseases of the heart pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
45 submit to a physical examination [, including an examination of the heart,] upon
46 employment, upon commencement of coverage and thereafter on an annual basis

11 a certificate of mailing issued by the United States Postal Service.
12 7. Failure to submit to a physical examination that is scheduled by his or her
13 employer pursuant to subsection 6 excludes the volunteer firefighter from the
14 benefits of this section.
15 8. The chief of a volunteer fire department may require an applicant to pay for
16 any physical examination required pursuant to this section if the applicant:
17 (a) Applies to the department for the first time as a volunteer firefighter; and

30 section if the correction is within the ability of the employee.
31 12. A person who is determined to be:
32 (a) Partially disabled from an occupational disease pursuant to the provisions
33 of this section; and
34 (b) Incapable of performing, with or without remuneration, work as a
35 firefighter, arson investigator or police officer,
36  may elect to receive the benefits provided under NRS 616C.440 for a permanent
37 total disability.
38 13. Claims filed under this section may be reopened at any time during the
39 life of the claimant for further examination and treatment of the claimant upon
40 certification by a physician of a change of circumstances related to the occupational

Senate Amendment No. 716 to Senate Bill No. 170 First Reprint Page 14
1 16. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an employer, insurer or
2 third-party administrator denies a claim that was filed pursuant to this section and
3 the claimant ultimately prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer
4 or third-party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit penalty
5 of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which an appeal is filed until
6 the date on which the claim is adjudicated to a final decision. Such benefit penalty
7 is payable in addition to any benefits to which the claimant is entitled under the
8 claim and any fines and penalties imposed by the Administrator pursuant to NRS
9 616D.120. If a hearing before a hearing officer is requested pursuant to NRS
10 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the employer, insurer or third-party
11 administrator, as applicable, shall pay to the claimant all medical costs which are

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter who is not
employed by the Executive Department of the State Government or
volunteer firefighter to submit to an annual cancer screening for certain
industrial insurance coverage for cancer; revising provisions governing
the administration of physical examinations required of certain
firefighters, arson investigators and police officers who are not
employed by the Executive Department of the State Government
for certain industrial insurance coverage for lung disease and heart
disease; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising out of and
2 in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive compensation under
3 industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law provides that certain diseases of the
4 lungs and heart contracted by certain firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters
5 and police officers are occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to
6 compensation under certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
7 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
8 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which depends on
9 the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457) Sections 2-4 of this bill
10 revise requirements for the administering of such a physical examination [.] for an employee
11 who is not an employee in the Executive Department of the State Government. [Section]
12 Effective July 1, 2026, section 2: (1) requires such a physical examination to be
13 administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or advanced practice registered nurse
14 who is knowledgeable about the physical demands of firefighting and law enforcement; and
15 (2) sets forth various tests and examinations that such a physical examination must include.
16 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer firefighters or
17 certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or death is an
18 occupational disease and compensable under industrial insurance under certain circumstances.
19 (NRS 617.453) [Section] Effective July 1, 2026, section 1 of this bill requires a firefighter ,
20 other than a firefighter who is an employee in the Executive Department of the State
21 Government, or volunteer firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon commencement of
22 coverage, thereafter on an annual basis during his or her employment and, if provided by the

Senate Amendment No. 716 to Senate Bill No. 170 First Reprint Page 4
23 employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets forth various requirements for the administration
24 of such a cancer screening.
