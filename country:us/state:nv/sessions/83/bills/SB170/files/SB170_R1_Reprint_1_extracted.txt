EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter or
volunteer firefighter to submit to an annual cancer
screening for certain industrial insurance coverage for
cancer; revising provisions governing the administration
of physical examinations required of certain firefighters,
arson investigators and police officers for certain
industrial insurance coverage for lung disease and heart
disease; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising
2 out of and in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive
3 compensation under industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law
4 provides that certain diseases of the lungs and heart contracted by certain
5 firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters and police officers are
6 occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to compensation under
7 certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
8 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
9 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which
10 depends on the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
11 Sections 2-4 of this bill revise requirements for the administering of such a physical
12 examination. Section 2: (1) requires such a physical examination to be
13 administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or advanced practice
14 registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical demands of firefighting
15 and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and examinations that such a
16 physical examination must include.

17 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer
18 firefighters or certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent
19 disability or death is an occupational disease and compensable under industrial
20 insurance under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.453) Section 1 of this bill
21 requires a firefighter or volunteer firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon
22 commencement of coverage, thereafter on an annual basis during his or her
23 employment and, if provided by the employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets
24 forth various requirements for the administration of such a cancer screening.

6 11. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an
7 employer, insurer or third-party administrator denies a claim that
8 was filed pursuant to this section and the claimant ultimately
9 prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer or third-
10 party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit
11 penalty of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which
12 an appeal is filed until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
13 a final decision. Such benefit penalty is payable in addition to any
14 benefits to which the claimant is entitled under the claim and any
15 fines and penalties imposed by the Administrator pursuant to NRS
16 616D.120. If a hearing before a hearing officer is requested pursuant
17 to NRS 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the
18 employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, shall
19 pay to the claimant all medical costs which are associated with the
20 occupational disease and are incurred from the date on which the
21 hearing is requested until the date on which the claim is adjudicated
22 to a final decision. If the employer, insurer or third-party
23 administrator, as applicable, ultimately prevails, the employer,
24 insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, is entitled to
25 recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance
26 with the provisions of NRS 616C.138.
27 Sec. 4. NRS 617.457 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 617.457 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
29 chapter, diseases of the heart of a person who, for 2 years or more,
30 has been employed in a full-time continuous, uninterrupted and
31 salaried occupation as a firefighter, arson investigator or police
32 officer in this State before the date of disablement are conclusively
33 presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment
34 if the disease is diagnosed and causes the disablement:
35 (a) During the course of that employment;
36 (b) If the person ceases employment before completing 20 years
37 of service as a police officer, firefighter or arson investigator, during
38 the period after separation from employment which is equal to the
39 number of years worked; or
40 (c) If the person ceases employment after completing 20 years
41 or more of service as a police officer, firefighter or arson
42 investigator, at any time during the person’s life.
43  Service credit which is purchased in a retirement system must not
44 be calculated towards the years of service of a person for the
45 purposes of this section.

1 2. Frequent or regular use of a tobacco product within 1 year,
2 or a material departure from a physician’s prescribed plan of care by
3 a person within 3 months, immediately preceding the filing of a
4 claim for compensation excludes a person who has separated from
5 service from the benefit of the conclusive presumption provided in
6 subsection 1.
7 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, diseases
8 of the heart, resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or
9 death, are occupational diseases and compensable as such under the
10 provisions of this chapter if caused by extreme overexertion in times
11 of stress or danger and a causal relationship can be shown by
12 competent evidence that the disability or death arose out of and was
13 caused by the performance of duties as a volunteer firefighter by a
14 person entitled to the benefits of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive,
15 of NRS pursuant to the provisions of NRS 616A.145 and who, for 5
16 years or more, has served continuously as a volunteer firefighter in
17 this State by continuously maintaining an active status on the roster
18 of a volunteer fire department.
19 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, each
20 employee who is to be covered for diseases of the heart pursuant to
21 the provisions of this section shall submit to a physical examination
22 [, including an examination of the heart,] upon employment, upon
23 commencement of coverage and thereafter on an annual basis during
24 his or her employment.
25 5. During the period in which a volunteer firefighter is
26 continuously on active status on the roster of a volunteer fire
27 department, a physical examination for the volunteer firefighter is
28 required:
29 (a) Upon employment;
30 (b) Upon commencement of coverage; and
31 (c) Once every 3 years after the physical examination that is
32 required pursuant to paragraph (b),
33  until the firefighter reaches the age of 50 years. Each volunteer
34 firefighter who is 50 years of age or older shall submit to a physical
35 examination once every 2 years during his or her employment.
36 6. The employer of the volunteer firefighter is responsible for
37 scheduling the physical examination. The employer shall mail to the
38 volunteer firefighter a written notice of the date, time and place of
39 the physical examination at least 10 days before the date of the
40 physical examination and shall obtain, at the time of mailing, a
41 certificate of mailing issued by the United States Postal Service.
42 7. Failure to submit to a physical examination that is scheduled
43 by his or her employer pursuant to subsection 6 excludes the
44 volunteer firefighter from the benefits of this section.

1 8. The chief of a volunteer fire department may require an
2 applicant to pay for any physical examination required pursuant to
3 this section if the applicant:
4 (a) Applies to the department for the first time as a volunteer
5 firefighter; and
6 (b) Is 50 years of age or older on the date of his or her
7 application.
8 9. The volunteer fire department shall reimburse an applicant
9 for the cost of a physical examination required pursuant to this

12 subsection 8;
13 (b) Is declared physically fit to perform the duties required of a
14 firefighter; and
15 (c) Becomes a volunteer with the volunteer fire department.
16 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, all physical
17 examinations required pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 must be paid
18 for by the employer.
19 11. Failure to correct predisposing conditions which lead to
20 heart disease when so ordered in writing by the examining physician
21 subsequent to a physical examination required pursuant to
22 subsection 4 or 5 excludes the employee from the benefits of this
23 section if the correction is within the ability of the employee.
24 12. A person who is determined to be:
25 (a) Partially disabled from an occupational disease pursuant to
26 the provisions of this section; and
27 (b) Incapable of performing, with or without remuneration, work
28 as a firefighter, arson investigator or police officer,
29  may elect to receive the benefits provided under NRS 616C.440
30 for a permanent total disability.
31 13. Claims filed under this section may be reopened at any
32 time during the life of the claimant for further examination and
33 treatment of the claimant upon certification by a physician of a
34 change of circumstances related to the occupational disease which
35 would warrant an increase or rearrangement of compensation.
36 14. A person who files a claim for a disease of the heart
37 specified in this section after he or she retires from employment as a
38 firefighter, arson investigator or police officer is not entitled to
39 receive any compensation for that disease other than medical
40 benefits.
41 15. The Administrator shall review a claim filed by a claimant
42 pursuant to this section that has been in the appeals process for
43 longer than 6 months to determine the circumstances causing the
44 delay in processing the claim. As used in this subsection, “appeals
45 process” means the period of time that:
-
*SB170_R1*
– 15 –
1 (a) Begins on the date on which the claimant first files or
2 submits a request for a hearing or an appeal of a determination
3 regarding the claim; and
4 (b) Continues until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
5 a final decision.
6 16. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if an
7 employer, insurer or third-party administrator denies a claim that
8 was filed pursuant to this section and the claimant ultimately
9 prevails, the Administrator may order the employer, insurer or third-
10 party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit
11 penalty of not more than $200 for each day from the date on which
12 an appeal is filed until the date on which the claim is adjudicated to
13 a final decision. Such benefit penalty is payable in addition to any
14 benefits to which the claimant is entitled under the claim and any
15 fines and penalties imposed by the Administrator pursuant to NRS
16 616D.120. If a hearing before a hearing officer is requested pursuant
17 to NRS 616C.315 and held pursuant to NRS 616C.330, the
18 employer, insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, shall
19 pay to the claimant all medical costs which are associated with the
20 occupational disease and are incurred from the date on which the
21 hearing is requested until the date on which the claim is adjudicated
22 to a final decision. If the employer, insurer or third-party
23 administrator, as applicable, ultimately prevails, the employer,
24 insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, is entitled to
25 recover the amount paid pursuant to this subsection in accordance
26 with the provisions of NRS 616C.138.
27 Sec. 5. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any

SENATE BILL NO. 170–SENATORS STEINBECK AND SCHEIBLE
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to industrial insurance.
(BDR 53-632)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 2)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; requiring a firefighter or
volunteer firefighter to submit to an annual cancer
screening for certain industrial insurance coverage for
cancer; revising provisions governing the administration
of physical examinations required of certain firefighters,
arson investigators and police officers for certain
industrial insurance coverage for lung disease and heart
disease; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee who contracts an occupational disease arising
2 out of and in the course of his or her employment is generally entitled to receive
3 compensation under industrial insurance. (Chapter 617 of NRS) Existing law
4 provides that certain diseases of the lungs and heart contracted by certain
5 firefighters, arson investigators, volunteer firefighters and police officers are
6 occupational diseases for which the employee is entitled to compensation under
7 certain circumstances. Under existing law, an employee covered by those
8 provisions is required to submit to a physical examination upon employment, upon
9 commencement of coverage and periodically thereafter, the frequency of which
10 depends on the age and occupation of the employee. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
11 Sections 2-4 of this bill revise requirements for the administering of such a physical
12 examination. Section 2: (1) requires such a physical examination to be
13 administered, when possible, by a licensed physician or advanced practice
14 registered nurse who is knowledgeable about the physical demands of firefighting
15 and law enforcement; and (2) sets forth various tests and examinations that such a
16 physical examination must include.

17 Under existing law, cancer contracted by certain firefighters, volunteer
18 firefighters or certain other employees resulting in either temporary or permanent
19 disability or death is an occupational disease and compensable under industrial
20 insurance under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.453) Section 1 of this bill
21 requires a firefighter or volunteer firefighter to submit to a cancer screening upon
22 commencement of coverage, thereafter on an annual basis during his or her
23 employment and, if provided by the employer, upon employment. Section 2 sets
24 forth various requirements for the administration of such a cancer screening.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 617.453 is hereby amended to read as follows:
