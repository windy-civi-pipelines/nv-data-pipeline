AN ACT relating to trade practices; revising provisions relating to
the sale of tickets for certain live entertainment events;
requiring providers of live entertainment tickets to clearly
and conspicuously disclose certain information relating to
pricing; prohibiting providers of live entertainment tickets
from misrepresenting certain information relating to pricing;
requiring providers of live entertainment tickets to issue

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
On January 10, 2025, The Federal Trade Commission published a final trade
regulation rule in the Federal Register entitled “Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees”
(“the Rule”). (90 Fed. Reg. 2066 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule, which will take effect
on May 12, 2025, prohibits a business that sells or offers live-event tickets from
offering, displaying or advertising the price of a live-event ticket without clearly
and conspicuously disclosing the maximum total price that a consumer must pay
for the live-event ticket, inclusive of all fees or charges that the consumer must pay
for any mandatory good or service sold as part of the purchase of the ticket. The
seller of live-event tickets is authorized to exclude from the total price required to
be disclosed for the live-event ticket any governmental charges, shipping charges
and charges for optional goods or services that the consumer may purchase as a part
of the same transaction. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1, 464.2; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2166-67
(Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule prescribes particular means by which a disclosure must
be “clearly and conspicuously” made to a consumer. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1; 90 Fed.
Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Additionally, the Rule prohibits a seller of live-
event tickets from misrepresenting any fee or charge. (16 C.F.R. § 464.3; 90 Fed.
Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Finally, the Rule provides that state law or
regulation may provide consumers with protection that is greater than, or at least
not inconsistent with, the protections for consumers prescribed by the Rule. (16
C.F.R. § 464.4; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025))
Existing state law prohibits a reseller, a secondary ticket exchange or an
affiliate of a reseller or secondary ticket exchange from reselling a ticket for a live
entertainment event without disclosing to the purchaser the total amount that the
purchaser will be charged for the ticket. (NRS 598.39795) Section 12 of this bill
repeals this provision. Instead, section 4 of this bill prescribes certain requirements
for businesses that sell tickets to live entertainment events, which are equivalent to
the requirements established in the Rule. Specifically, section 4 prohibits a ticket
provider from offering, displaying or advertising any price of a ticket for a live
entertainment event unless the ticket provider clearly and conspicuously discloses
the total price of the ticket. Section 4 also requires certain information to be clearly
and conspicuously disclosed to a consumer before the consumer agrees to purchase
a ticket from the ticket provider. Section 4 prescribes certain means by which a
ticket provider must clearly and conspicuously make such disclosures to
consumers, which are identical to those means prescribed in the Rule. Section 4
also prohibits a ticket provider from misrepresenting any fee or charge.

Section 5 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a ticket provider to
provide a refund of the full amount a purchaser paid to the ticket provider for a
ticket to a live entertainment event, including all applicable fees and governmental
charges, if the event to which the ticket pertains is cancelled. Section 5 requires
that the refund be provided to the purchaser not more than 30 days after the sponsor
of the event notifies the public that the live entertainment event is cancelled.
Existing law prohibits certain other practices and acts relating to the sale and
resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS 598.397-598.3984) Existing
law entitles a person who is injured by a violation of such provisions to bring a civil
action against the reseller, secondary ticket exchange or affiliate of the reseller or
secondary ticket exchange that committed the violation. Section 9 of this bill
clarifies that this remedy does not extend to violations of section 4 or 5. Section 8
of this bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
Attorney General to accept reports of violations of sections 4 and 5 using the
mechanisms by which the Bureau receives reports of violations of other provisions
relating to the sale and resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS
598.3981) Sections 10 and 11 of this bill provide that a willful violation of section
4 or 5 is punishable by certain criminal penalties, which are currently applicable to
willful violations of other provisions relating to the sale or resale of tickets for live
entertainment events. (NRS 598.3983, 598.3984)
Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-598.0925) If a person
engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to the imposition
of certain restraints by injunction and civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0979,
598.0985, 598.0999) Existing law makes a knowing violation of provisions relating
to the sale and resale of tickets for live entertainment events a deceptive trade
practice. (NRS 598.09223) Section 6 of this bill makes a knowing violation of
section 4 or 5 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violator of those
sections to additional civil and criminal penalties.
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
establishes the applicability of those definitions.

(g) If the communication requiring the disclosure is made
through both visual and audible means, including, without

subsection in each medium through which it is received,
including, without limitation, all electronic devices and face-to-
face communications.

contest or live entertainment event, as applicable, notifies the
public that the athletic contest or live entertainment event to which
the ticket pertains is cancelled.
2. A ticket provider is not required to provide a refund
pursuant to subsection 1 if, in the discretion of the ticket provider:
