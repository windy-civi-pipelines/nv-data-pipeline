AN ACT relating to trade practices; revising provisions relating to the sale of
tickets for certain live entertainment events; requiring providers of live
entertainment tickets to clearly and conspicuously disclose certain
information relating to pricing; prohibiting providers of live
entertainment tickets from misrepresenting certain information relating
to pricing; requiring providers of live entertainment tickets to issue
refunds in certain circumstances; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 On January 10, 2025, The Federal Trade Commission published a final trade regulation
2 rule in the Federal Register entitled “Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees” (“the Rule”). (90 Fed.
3 Reg. 2066 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule, which will take effect on May 12, 2025, prohibits a
4 business that sells or offers live-event tickets from offering, displaying or advertising the price
5 of a live-event ticket without clearly and conspicuously disclosing the maximum total price
6 that a consumer must pay for the live-event ticket, inclusive of all fees or charges that the
7 consumer must pay for any mandatory good or service sold as part of the purchase of the
8 ticket. The seller of live-event tickets is authorized to exclude from the total price required to
9 be disclosed for the live-event ticket any governmental charges, shipping charges and charges
10 for optional goods or services that the consumer may purchase as a part of the same
11 transaction. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1, 464.2; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2166-67 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule
12 prescribes particular means by which a disclosure must be “clearly and conspicuously” made
13 to a consumer. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Additionally, the
14 Rule prohibits a seller of live-event tickets from misrepresenting any fee or charge. (16 C.F.R.
15 § 464.3; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Finally, the Rule provides that state law or
16 regulation may provide consumers with protection that is greater than, or at least not
17 inconsistent with, the protections for consumers prescribed by the Rule. (16 C.F.R. § 464.4;
18 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025))
19 Existing state law prohibits a reseller, a secondary ticket exchange or an affiliate of a
20 reseller or secondary ticket exchange from reselling a ticket for a live entertainment event
21 without disclosing to the purchaser the total amount that the purchaser will be charged for the
22 ticket. (NRS 598.39795) Section 12 of this bill repeals this provision. Instead, section 4 of

Senate Amendment No. 314 to Senate Bill No. 338 Page 4
23 this bill prescribes certain requirements for businesses that sell tickets to live entertainment
24 events, which are equivalent to the requirements established in the Rule. Specifically, section
25 4 prohibits a ticket provider from offering, displaying or advertising any price of a ticket for a
26 live entertainment event unless the ticket provider clearly and conspicuously discloses the
27 total price of the ticket. Section 4 also requires certain information to be clearly and
28 conspicuously disclosed to a consumer before the consumer agrees to purchase a ticket from
29 the ticket provider. Section 4 prescribes certain means by which a ticket provider must clearly
30 and conspicuously make such disclosures to consumers, which are identical to those means
31 prescribed in the Rule. Section 4 also prohibits a ticket provider from misrepresenting any fee
32 or charge.
33 Section 5 of this bill requires , with certain exceptions, a ticket provider to provide a
34 refund of the full amount a purchaser paid to the ticket provider for a ticket to a live
35 entertainment event, including all applicable fees and governmental charges, if the event to
36 which the ticket pertains is cancelled. Section 5 requires that the refund be provided to the
37 purchaser not more than 30 days after the sponsor of the event notifies the public that the live
38 entertainment event is cancelled.
39 Existing law prohibits certain other practices and acts relating to the sale and resale of
40 tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS 598.397-598.3984) Existing law entitles a person
41 who is injured by a violation of such provisions to bring a civil action against the reseller,
42 secondary ticket exchange or affiliate of the reseller or secondary ticket exchange that
43 committed the violation. [Existing law prescribes certain statutory awards, in addition to other
44 damages, that a court may award a prevailing plaintiff based on the number of violations
45 previously committed by the violator. (NRS 598.3982)] Section 9 of this bill [: (1) authorizes
46 a person injured by a violation of section 4 or 5 to bring such civil action against the ticket
47 provider that committed the violation; and (2) increases the statutory amounts that may be
48 awarded to a plaintiff injured by a violation of any provision relating to the sale or resale of
49 tickets for live entertainment events.] clarifies that this remedy does not extend to
50 violations of sections 4 or 5. Section 8 of this bill requires the Bureau of Consumer
51 Protection in the Office of the Attorney General to accept reports of violations of sections 4
52 and 5 using the mechanisms by which the Bureau receives reports of violations of other
53 provisions relating to the sale and resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS
54 598.3981) Sections 10 and 11 of this bill provide that a willful violation of section 4 or 5 is
55 punishable by certain criminal penalties, which are currently applicable to willful violations of
56 other provisions relating to the sale or resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS
57 598.3983, 598.3984)
58 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations that
59 constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-598.0925) If a person engages in a
60 deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to the imposition of certain restraints by
61 injunction and civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0979, 598.0985, 598.0999) Existing law
62 makes a knowing violation of provisions relating to the sale and resale of tickets for live
63 entertainment events a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.09223) Section 6 of this bill makes
64 a knowing violation of section 4 or 5 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violator
65 of those sections to additional civil and criminal penalties.
66 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill establishes the
67 applicability of those definitions.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 598 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2 to 5, inclusive, of this act.

4 Federal Government or this State, or any agency or political subdivision thereof,
5 or a tribal government imposes on or requires to be collected in connection with

Senate Amendment No. 314 to Senate Bill No. 338 Page 5
1 Sec. 3. “Ticket provider” means a natural person, proprietorship,
2 corporation, partnership, trust, unincorporated organization or other enterprise
3 that is engaged in the business of selling tickets, reselling tickets or offering
4 tickets for sale, including, without limitation, a primary ticket provider, reseller or

6 Sec. 4. 1. A ticket provider shall not offer, display or advertise any price
7 of a ticket without clearly and conspicuously disclosing the total price of the

16 for which the fee or charge is imposed; and

18 3. A ticket provider shall display the total price of the ticket more
19 prominently than any other information relating to the price of the ticket. Where

21 final amount of payment must be disclosed more prominently than, or as
22 prominently as, the total price.
23 4. For the purposes of subsections 1 and 2, a ticket provider makes a clear
24 and conspicuous disclosure if the disclosure is easily noticeable and
25 understandable by an ordinary consumer, and:
26 (a) The disclosure uses clear and comprehensible language, diction and
27 syntax that is easily understandable to an ordinary consumer or, if the
28 communication containing the disclosure is specifically targeted at a specific
29 subset of consumers, including, without limitation, children or seniors, the
30 disclosure uses clear and comprehensible language, diction and syntax that is
31 easily understandable to consumers in that subset of consumers.
32 (b) The disclosure is not contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with,
33 anything else contained within the communication containing the disclosure.
34 (c) The disclosure, if displayed visually, stands out from any accompanying
35 text or other visual elements by its size, contrast, location, the length of time it
36 appears and other characteristics, so that it is easily noticed, read and
37 understood.
38 (d) If the disclosure is made through audible means, including, without
39 limitation, by telephone or streaming video, the disclosure is delivered in a
40 volume, speed and cadence that would allow an ordinary consumer to easily hear
41 and understand the disclosure.
42 (e) If the communication requiring the disclosure is displayed using an
43 interactive electronic medium, including, without limitation, an Internet web
44 browser or mobile application, the disclosure is unavoidable.
45 (f) If the communication requiring the disclosure is made through solely
46 audible or solely visual means, the disclosure is made through the same means as
47 the whole communication.
48 (g) If the communication requiring the disclosure is made through both
49 visual and audible means, including, without limitation, through a television
50 advertisement, the communication is presented simultaneously in both the visual
51 and audible portion of the communication, even if the representation requiring
52 the disclosure is made in only one means.

Senate Amendment No. 314 to Senate Bill No. 338 Page 6
1 (h) The disclosure complies with all of the requirements of this subsection in
2 each medium through which it is received, including, without limitation, all
3 electronic devices and face-to-face communications.
4 5. A ticket provider shall not misrepresent any fee or charge, including,
5 without limitation, misrepresenting:
6 (a) The nature, purpose or refundability of any fee or charge; or
7 (b) The identity of any good or service for which the fee or charge is
8 imposed.
9 6. As used in this section:
10 (a) “Ancillary good or service” means any additional good or service offered
11 to a consumer as part of a transaction for the purchase of a ticket.

13 amount that a ticket provider incurs to deliver or send a physical ticket to a
14 consumer.
15 (c) “Total price” means the maximum total of all fees or charges that a
16 consumer must pay to complete a transaction to purchase a ticket, including,
17 without limitation, a fee or charge for any mandatory ancillary good or service.
18 Sec. 5. [A]
19 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a ticket provider that sells a
20 ticket to a purchaser shall provide the purchaser with a refund of the full amount
21 that the purchaser paid the ticket provider for the ticket, inclusive of all fees and
22 governmental charges, if the athletic contest or live entertainment event to which
23 the ticket pertains is cancelled. A ticket provider must provide a refund required
24 pursuant to this subsection not more than 30 days after the rights holder or
25 sponsor of the athletic contest or live entertainment event, as applicable, notifies
26 the public that the athletic contest or live entertainment event to which the ticket
27 pertains is cancelled.
28 2. A ticket provider is not required to provide a refund pursuant to
29 subsection 1 if, in the discretion of the ticket provider:
30 (a) The athletic contest or live entertainment event for which the ticket
31 provider sold a ticket is cancelled because of:
32 (1) A major catastrophe or other event for which a state of emergency or
33 declaration of disaster is proclaimed pursuant to NRS 414.070;

40 the terms and conditions of the live event ticket sold by the ticket provider that the
41 athletic contest or live entertainment event will occur notwithstanding inclement
42 weather conditions, other than extreme or dangerous weather conditions and,
43 because of such extreme or dangerous weather conditions, the live entertainment
