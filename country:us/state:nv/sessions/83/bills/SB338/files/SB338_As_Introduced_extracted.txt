EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to trade practices; revising provisions relating to
the sale of tickets for certain live entertainment events;
requiring providers of live entertainment tickets to clearly
and conspicuously disclose certain information relating to
pricing; prohibiting providers of live entertainment tickets
from misrepresenting certain information relating to
pricing; requiring providers of live entertainment tickets

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 On January 10, 2025, The Federal Trade Commission published a final trade
2 regulation rule in the Federal Register entitled “Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees”
3 (“the Rule”). (90 Fed. Reg. 2066 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule, which will take effect
4 on May 12, 2025, prohibits a business that sells or offers live-event tickets from
5 offering, displaying or advertising the price of a live-event ticket without clearly
6 and conspicuously disclosing the maximum total price that a consumer must pay
7 for the live-event ticket, inclusive of all fees or charges that the consumer must pay
8 for any mandatory good or service sold as part of the purchase of the ticket. The
9 seller of live-event tickets is authorized to exclude from the total price required to
10 be disclosed for the live-event ticket any governmental charges, shipping charges
11 and charges for optional goods or services that the consumer may purchase as a part
12 of the same transaction. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1, 464.2; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2166-67
13 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule prescribes particular means by which a disclosure must
14 be “clearly and conspicuously” made to a consumer. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1; 90 Fed.
15 Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Additionally, the Rule prohibits a seller of live-
16 event tickets from misrepresenting any fee or charge. (16 C.F.R. § 464.3; 90 Fed.
-
*SB338*
– 2 –
17 Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Finally, the Rule provides that state law or
18 regulation may provide consumers with protection that is greater than, or at least
19 not inconsistent with, the protections for consumers prescribed by the Rule. (16
20 C.F.R. § 464.4; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025))
21 Existing state law prohibits a reseller, a secondary ticket exchange or an
22 affiliate of a reseller or secondary ticket exchange from reselling a ticket for a live
23 entertainment event without disclosing to the purchaser the total amount that the
24 purchaser will be charged for the ticket. (NRS 598.39795) Section 12 of this bill
25 repeals this provision. Instead, section 4 of this bill prescribes certain requirements
26 for businesses that sell tickets to live entertainment events, which are equivalent to
27 the requirements established in the Rule. Specifically, section 4 prohibits a ticket
28 provider from offering, displaying or advertising any price of a ticket for a live
29 entertainment event unless the ticket provider clearly and conspicuously discloses
30 the total price of the ticket. Section 4 also requires certain information to be clearly
31 and conspicuously disclosed to a consumer before the consumer agrees to
32 purchases a ticket from the ticket provider. Section 4 prescribes certain means by
33 which a ticket provider must clearly and conspicuously make such disclosures to
34 consumers, which are identical to those means prescribed in the Rule. Section 4
35 also prohibits a ticket provider from misrepresenting any fee or charge.
36 Section 5 of this bill requires a ticket provider to provide a refund of the full
37 amount a purchaser paid to the ticket provider for a ticket to a live entertainment
38 event, including all applicable fees and governmental charges, if the event to which
39 the ticket pertains is cancelled. Section 5 requires that the refund be provided to the
40 purchaser not more than 30 days after the sponsor of the event notifies the public
41 that the live entertainment event is cancelled.
42 Existing law prohibits certain other practices and acts relating to the sale and
43 resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS 598.397-598.3984) Existing
44 law entitles a person who is injured by a violation of such provisions to bring a civil
45 action against the reseller, secondary ticket exchange or affiliate of the reseller or
46 secondary ticket exchange that committed the violation. Existing law prescribes
47 certain statutory awards, in addition to other damages, that a court may award a
48 prevailing plaintiff based on the number of violations previously committed by the
49 violator. (NRS 598.3982) Section 9 of this bill: (1) authorizes a person injured by a
50 violation of section 4 or 5 to bring such civil action against the ticket provider that
51 committed the violation; and (2) increases the statutory amounts that may be
52 awarded to a plaintiff injured by a violation of any provision relating to the sale or
53 resale of tickets for live entertainment events. Section 8 of this bill requires the
54 Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General to accept
55 reports of violations of sections 4 and 5 using the mechanisms by which the
56 Bureau receives reports of violations of other provisions relating to the sale and
57 resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS 598.3981) Sections 10 and 11
58 of this bill provide that a willful violation of section 4 or 5 is punishable by certain
59 criminal penalties, which are currently applicable to willful violations of other
60 provisions relating to the sale or resale of tickets for live entertainment events.
61 (NRS 598.3983, 598.3984)
62 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
63 that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-598.0925) If a person
64 engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to the imposition
65 of certain restraints by injunction and civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0979,
66 598.0985, 598.0999) Existing law makes a knowing violation of provisions relating
67 to the sale and resale of tickets for live entertainment events a deceptive trade
68 practice. (NRS 598.09223) Section 6 of this bill makes a knowing violation of
69 section 4 or 5 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violator of those
70 sections to additional civil and criminal penalties.

5 charges that a consumer must pay to complete a transaction to

9 shall provide the purchaser with a refund of the full amount that

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the sale of tickets to a
live entertainment event. (BDR 52-590)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to trade practices; revising provisions relating to
the sale of tickets for certain live entertainment events;
requiring providers of live entertainment tickets to clearly
and conspicuously disclose certain information relating to
pricing; prohibiting providers of live entertainment tickets
from misrepresenting certain information relating to
pricing; requiring providers of live entertainment tickets
to issue refunds in certain circumstances; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 On January 10, 2025, The Federal Trade Commission published a final trade
2 regulation rule in the Federal Register entitled “Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees”
3 (“the Rule”). (90 Fed. Reg. 2066 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule, which will take effect
4 on May 12, 2025, prohibits a business that sells or offers live-event tickets from
5 offering, displaying or advertising the price of a live-event ticket without clearly
6 and conspicuously disclosing the maximum total price that a consumer must pay
7 for the live-event ticket, inclusive of all fees or charges that the consumer must pay
8 for any mandatory good or service sold as part of the purchase of the ticket. The
9 seller of live-event tickets is authorized to exclude from the total price required to
10 be disclosed for the live-event ticket any governmental charges, shipping charges
11 and charges for optional goods or services that the consumer may purchase as a part
12 of the same transaction. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1, 464.2; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2166-67
13 (Jan. 10, 2025)) The Rule prescribes particular means by which a disclosure must
14 be “clearly and conspicuously” made to a consumer. (16 C.F.R. § 464.1; 90 Fed.
15 Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Additionally, the Rule prohibits a seller of live-
16 event tickets from misrepresenting any fee or charge. (16 C.F.R. § 464.3; 90 Fed.
-
*SB338*

– 2 –
17 Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025)) Finally, the Rule provides that state law or
18 regulation may provide consumers with protection that is greater than, or at least
19 not inconsistent with, the protections for consumers prescribed by the Rule. (16
20 C.F.R. § 464.4; 90 Fed. Reg. 2066, 2167 (Jan. 10, 2025))
21 Existing state law prohibits a reseller, a secondary ticket exchange or an
22 affiliate of a reseller or secondary ticket exchange from reselling a ticket for a live
23 entertainment event without disclosing to the purchaser the total amount that the
24 purchaser will be charged for the ticket. (NRS 598.39795) Section 12 of this bill
25 repeals this provision. Instead, section 4 of this bill prescribes certain requirements
26 for businesses that sell tickets to live entertainment events, which are equivalent to
27 the requirements established in the Rule. Specifically, section 4 prohibits a ticket
28 provider from offering, displaying or advertising any price of a ticket for a live
29 entertainment event unless the ticket provider clearly and conspicuously discloses
30 the total price of the ticket. Section 4 also requires certain information to be clearly
31 and conspicuously disclosed to a consumer before the consumer agrees to
32 purchases a ticket from the ticket provider. Section 4 prescribes certain means by
33 which a ticket provider must clearly and conspicuously make such disclosures to
34 consumers, which are identical to those means prescribed in the Rule. Section 4
35 also prohibits a ticket provider from misrepresenting any fee or charge.
36 Section 5 of this bill requires a ticket provider to provide a refund of the full
37 amount a purchaser paid to the ticket provider for a ticket to a live entertainment
38 event, including all applicable fees and governmental charges, if the event to which
39 the ticket pertains is cancelled. Section 5 requires that the refund be provided to the
40 purchaser not more than 30 days after the sponsor of the event notifies the public
41 that the live entertainment event is cancelled.
42 Existing law prohibits certain other practices and acts relating to the sale and
43 resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS 598.397-598.3984) Existing
44 law entitles a person who is injured by a violation of such provisions to bring a civil
45 action against the reseller, secondary ticket exchange or affiliate of the reseller or
46 secondary ticket exchange that committed the violation. Existing law prescribes
47 certain statutory awards, in addition to other damages, that a court may award a
48 prevailing plaintiff based on the number of violations previously committed by the
49 violator. (NRS 598.3982) Section 9 of this bill: (1) authorizes a person injured by a
50 violation of section 4 or 5 to bring such civil action against the ticket provider that
51 committed the violation; and (2) increases the statutory amounts that may be
52 awarded to a plaintiff injured by a violation of any provision relating to the sale or
53 resale of tickets for live entertainment events. Section 8 of this bill requires the
54 Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General to accept
55 reports of violations of sections 4 and 5 using the mechanisms by which the
56 Bureau receives reports of violations of other provisions relating to the sale and
57 resale of tickets for live entertainment events. (NRS 598.3981) Sections 10 and 11
58 of this bill provide that a willful violation of section 4 or 5 is punishable by certain
59 criminal penalties, which are currently applicable to willful violations of other
60 provisions relating to the sale or resale of tickets for live entertainment events.
61 (NRS 598.3983, 598.3984)
62 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
63 that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-598.0925) If a person
64 engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to the imposition
65 of certain restraints by injunction and civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0979,
66 598.0985, 598.0999) Existing law makes a knowing violation of provisions relating
67 to the sale and resale of tickets for live entertainment events a deceptive trade
68 practice. (NRS 598.09223) Section 6 of this bill makes a knowing violation of
69 section 4 or 5 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violator of those
70 sections to additional civil and criminal penalties.
