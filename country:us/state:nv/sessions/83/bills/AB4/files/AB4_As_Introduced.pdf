EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; authorizing the Division of Parole
and Probation of the Department of Public Safety to
petition the sentencing court or the State Board of Parole
Commissioners for the release of a person sentenced to
lifetime supervision; authorizing the sentencing court or
Board to grant such a petition under certain
circumstances; clarifying provisions relating to certain
allowable deductions from the period of probation of
certain offenders; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a court to include a special sentence of lifetime
2 supervision for any person convicted of certain sexual offenses. Existing law also:
3 (1) authorizes a person sentenced to lifetime supervision to petition the sentencing
4 court or the State Board of Parole Commissioners for release from lifetime
5 supervision; and (2) requires the sentencing court or Board to grant the petition for
6 release if, among other requirements, the person has not been convicted of an
7 offense that poses a threat to the safety or well-being of others for at least 10
8 consecutive years after the person’s last conviction or release from incarceration,
9 whichever occurs later. (NRS 176.0931) Section 1 of this bill similarly authorizes
10 the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety to petition
11 the sentencing court or the State Board of Parole Commissioners for the release of a
12 person sentenced to lifetime supervision. Section 1 also authorizes the sentencing
13 court or Board to grant such a petition if the person who is the subject of the
14 petition has not been convicted of an offense that poses a threat to the safety or

15 well-being of others for at least 20 consecutive years after the person’s last
16 conviction or release from incarceration, whichever occurs later. Section 3 of this
17 bill makes a conforming change to refer to a provision that has been renumbered in
18 section 1.
19 Existing law authorizes a court to place an offender on probation for a fixed
20 period or an indeterminate period. Under existing law, an offender sentenced to
21 serve a period of probation for a felony or gross misdemeanor must be allowed
22 certain deductions from the period of probation for each month the offender serves
23 and is: (1) current with certain fees and any payment of restitution ordered by the
24 court; or (2) actively involved in employment or enrolled in certain programs.
25 (NRS 176A.500) Section 2 of this bill clarifies that an offender sentenced to serve a
26 period of probation for a felony or gross misdemeanor must be allowed such
27 deductions regardless of whether the period of probation of the offender is
28 indeterminate or fixed by the court.
29 Section 4 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of: (1) section 1
30 apply to a person who is sentenced to lifetime supervision before, on or after
31 October 1, 2025; and (2) section 2 apply to a person who is sentenced to serve a
32 period of probation before, on or after October 1, 2025.

43 conditions of probation. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
44 5, the parole and probation officer or the peace officer, after making

6 5. A parole and probation officer or a peace officer may
7 immediately release from custody without any further proceedings
8 any person the officer arrests without a warrant for violating a
9 condition of probation if the parole and probation officer or peace
10 officer determines that there is no probable cause to believe that the
11 person violated the condition of probation.
12 6. [A] Regardless of whether the period of probation ordered
13 pursuant to subsection 1 is indeterminate or fixed by the court, a
14 person who is sentenced to serve a period of probation for a felony
15 or a gross misdemeanor must be allowed for the period of the
16 probation a deduction of:

27 minimum monthly payment, by the Division.

36 6 if the person has satisfied the requirements of both paragraphs of
37 that subsection.
38 8. A person who is sentenced to serve a period of probation for
39 a felony or a gross misdemeanor and who is a participant in a
40 specialty court program must be allowed a deduction from the
41 period of probation for being actively involved in employment or
