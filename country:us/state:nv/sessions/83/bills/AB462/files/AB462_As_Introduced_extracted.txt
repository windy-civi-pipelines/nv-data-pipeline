Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
2 more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
3 incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
4 operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
5 that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
6 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
7 Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
8 industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
9 the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
10 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
11 Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.”
12 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
13 industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
14 or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
15 account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
16 certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
17 designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
18 portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
19 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
20 incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 7 of this
21 bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities by counties or incorporated
22 cities that have created an inland port or industrial park. Section 4 of this bill sets
23 forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park which may be undertaken
24 using the funding generated by the tax increment area. Section 3 of this bill defines
25 the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland Port and Industrial Park
26 Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new definitions created by this bill
27 to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and Industrial Park Authority Act.
28 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to
29 section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
30 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
31 industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
32 Development.
33 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
34 directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section
35 16 of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating
36 entities in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the
37 Governor.
38 Existing law requires each large school district, meaning a school district in this
39 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
40 the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway
41 Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled
42 to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as professionals in K-
43 12 education and authorizes a large school district, or a school district which is not
44 a large school district, to offer the Program at other high schools. (NRS 388.223)
45 Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the high schools at which a
46 large school district is required to offer the Program. Section 25 requires a school
47 district to offer dual credit courses at each high school which offers the Program in
48 subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a bachelor’s degree in
49 education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain at least 2 units of
50 college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to the State Board of
51 Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain internships and
52 dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is not located in
53 an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the location of the
54 high school makes providing such internships or courses impracticable.

55 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
56 a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
57 Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
58 request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
59 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
60 offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
61 administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)
62 Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
63 ensure that at least one licensed teacher is assigned full-time to implement and
64 teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program.
65 Section 25 requires a pupil, to complete the Program, to: (1) complete at least 2
66 units of college credit in certain courses and internships or complete a program of
67 career and technical education in the area of teaching; and (2) participate in at least
68 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which is relevant to the field of
69 teaching.
70 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish
71 certain State Seals, including the State Seal of Biliteracy, the State Seal of Civics
72 and the State Seal of STEM, which may be affixed to the diploma and noted on the
73 transcript of a pupil to recognize that the pupil has met certain requirements. (NRS
74 388.591, 388.5933, 388.594) Section 24 of this bill requires the Superintendent of
75 Public Instruction to create a State Seal of Teacher Training and requires each
76 board of trustees of a school district that offers the Program to affix the Seal to the
77 diploma of and note the receipt of the Seal on the transcript of each pupil who
78 completes the Program.
79 Existing law requires the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to
80 waive the payment of registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory
81 fees assessed each semester against certain students. (NRS 396.5443, 396.5449)
82 Section 26 of this bill requires the Board of Regents to waive the payment of
83 registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed each
84 semester for a course of dual credit which a high school pupil enrolls in as part of
85 the Program, for the first 12 credit hours of such courses in which a high school
86 pupil enrolls. Section 26 requires the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of the
87 payment of any application or admission fee for an undergraduate program assessed
88 against a person who has completed the Program.
89 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
90 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
91 mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
92 by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
93 licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
94 years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill removes the requirement for a person
95 to have worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school for at least 3
96 consecutive school years to receive such reimbursement and, instead, authorizes the
97 State Treasurer to provide such reimbursement to anyone who has completed the
98 Program and completed the application for federal student aid.
99 Section 27 of this bill authorizes a phased-in implementation of the Program by
100 requiring a large school district to provide the Program at an increasing number of
101 high schools with 250 or more pupils enrolled until August 1, 2033, by which date
102 every high school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled, other than
103 high schools which are exempt, must provide the Program.
104 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Development to: (1)
105 establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
106 establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
107 pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
108 (NRS 232.985) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs, as well as
109 the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways programs.

110 Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways program at a
111 high school to: (1) offer career exploration opportunities in certain priority
112 industries to pupils at each middle school or junior high school which feeds into the
113 high school; and (2) designate a full-time staff member at the high school to
114 coordinate career pathways programs.
115 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
116 Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
117 measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
118 success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
119 provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (4) report its findings to
120 the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education. Section 23
121 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the
122 Department to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain
123 technical support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
2 more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
3 incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
4 operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
5 that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
6 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
7 Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
8 industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
9 the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
10 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
11 Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.”
12 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
13 industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
14 or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
15 account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
16 certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
17 designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
18 portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
19 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
20 incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 7 of this
21 bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities by counties or incorporated
22 cities that have created an inland port or industrial park. Section 4 of this bill sets
23 forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park which may be undertaken
24 using the funding generated by the tax increment area. Section 3 of this bill defines
25 the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland Port and Industrial Park
26 Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new definitions created by this bill
27 to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and Industrial Park Authority Act.
28 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to
29 section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
30 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
31 industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
32 Development.
33 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
34 directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section
35 16 of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating
36 entities in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the
37 Governor.
38 Existing law requires each large school district, meaning a school district in this
39 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
40 the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway
41 Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled
42 to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as professionals in K-
43 12 education and authorizes a large school district, or a school district which is not
44 a large school district, to offer the Program at other high schools. (NRS 388.223)
45 Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the high schools at which a
46 large school district is required to offer the Program. Section 25 requires a school
47 district to offer dual credit courses at each high school which offers the Program in
48 subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a bachelor’s degree in
49 education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain at least 2 units of
50 college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to the State Board of
51 Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain internships and
52 dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is not located in
53 an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the location of the
54 high school makes providing such internships or courses impracticable.

55 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
56 a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
57 Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
58 request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
59 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
60 offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
61 administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)
62 Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
63 ensure that at least one licensed teacher is assigned full-time to implement and
64 teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program.
65 Section 25 requires a pupil, to complete the Program, to: (1) complete at least 2
66 units of college credit in certain courses and internships or complete a program of
67 career and technical education in the area of teaching; and (2) participate in at least
68 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which is relevant to the field of
69 teaching.
70 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish
71 certain State Seals, including the State Seal of Biliteracy, the State Seal of Civics
72 and the State Seal of STEM, which may be affixed to the diploma and noted on the
73 transcript of a pupil to recognize that the pupil has met certain requirements. (NRS
74 388.591, 388.5933, 388.594) Section 24 of this bill requires the Superintendent of
75 Public Instruction to create a State Seal of Teacher Training and requires each
76 board of trustees of a school district that offers the Program to affix the Seal to the
77 diploma of and note the receipt of the Seal on the transcript of each pupil who
78 completes the Program.
79 Existing law requires the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to
80 waive the payment of registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory
81 fees assessed each semester against certain students. (NRS 396.5443, 396.5449)
82 Section 26 of this bill requires the Board of Regents to waive the payment of
83 registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed each
84 semester for a course of dual credit which a high school pupil enrolls in as part of
85 the Program, for the first 12 credit hours of such courses in which a high school
86 pupil enrolls. Section 26 requires the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of the
87 payment of any application or admission fee for an undergraduate program assessed
88 against a person who has completed the Program.
89 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
90 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
91 mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
92 by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
93 licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
94 years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill removes the requirement for a person
95 to have worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school for at least 3
96 consecutive school years to receive such reimbursement and, instead, authorizes the
97 State Treasurer to provide such reimbursement to anyone who has completed the
98 Program and completed the application for federal student aid.
99 Section 27 of this bill authorizes a phased-in implementation of the Program by
100 requiring a large school district to provide the Program at an increasing number of
101 high schools with 250 or more pupils enrolled until August 1, 2033, by which date
102 every high school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled, other than
103 high schools which are exempt, must provide the Program.
104 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Development to: (1)
105 establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
106 establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
107 pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
108 (NRS 232.985) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs, as well as
109 the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways programs.

*AB462*

110 Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways program at a
111 high school to: (1) offer career exploration opportunities in certain priority
112 industries to pupils at each middle school or junior high school which feeds into the
113 high school; and (2) designate a full-time staff member at the high school to
114 coordinate career pathways programs.
115 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
116 Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
117 measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
118 success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
119 provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (4) report its findings to
120 the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education. Section 23
121 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the
122 Department to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain
123 technical support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.

1 Sec. 5. 1. If an inland port or industrial park is created by
2 one participating entity, the participating entity, on behalf of the
3 county or incorporated city in which the inland port or industrial
4 park is located, may adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment
5 area within the inland port or industrial park consisting of all or
6 any portion of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of
7 creating a special account for the payment of bonds or securities
8 issued or loans, money advanced or indebtedness incurred to
9 defray the costs of an undertaking, as supplemented by the Local
10 Government Securities Law.
11 2. If an inland port or industrial park is created by two or
12 more participating entities, the participating entities may enter
13 into an interlocal or cooperative agreement for the ordering of an
14 undertaking whose boundaries encompass all or part of the inland
15 port or industrial park and the creation of a tax increment area
16 and the tax increment account pertaining thereto. A tax increment
17 area created pursuant to this subsection must be administered as
18 provided in the interlocal or cooperative agreement,
19 notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary. If
20 the participating entities enter into an interlocal or cooperative
21 agreement pursuant to this subsection, the participating entities
22 may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the interlocal
23 or cooperative agreement:
24 (a) Jointly take any action required to be taken by a

29 (c) Issue bonds or otherwise finance the cost of the
30 undertaking.
31 3. A participating entity may amend an ordinance creating a

35 removing or modifying undertakings specified in the original
36 ordinance.
37 (b) Add areas to or remove areas from a tax increment area.
38  The amount of taxes to be allocated to a tax increment account
39 pursuant to subsection 5 must be computed separately for the
40 original tax increment area and each addition of land thereto.
41 4. A participating entity shall not adopt an ordinance creating
42 a tax increment area pursuant to this section unless:
43 (a) The board has determined that the undertaking described
44 in the ordinance is necessary or desirable to further the purposes
45 of the inland port or industrial park.
-
*AB462*

– 6 –
1 (b) The participating entity makes a finding at a public
2 hearing that the undertaking will benefit the inland port or
3 industrial park.
4 5. After the effective date of the ordinance adopted pursuant
5 to subsection 1, any taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax
6 increment area each year by or for the benefit of the State, the
7 municipality and any public body must be divided as follows:
8 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the
9 rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of those
10 taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the
11 taxable property in the tax increment area as shown upon the last
12 equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
13 the property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to, and when
14 collected must be paid into, the funds of the respective taxing
15 agencies as taxes by or for the taxing agencies on all other
16 property are paid.
17 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of
18 the taxes levied each year in excess of the amount determined
19 pursuant to paragraph (a) must be allocated to, and when
20 collected must be paid into, the tax increment account pertaining
21 to the undertaking to pay the bond requirements of loans, money
22 advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed
23 or otherwise, incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance,
24 in whole or in part, the undertaking. Unless the total assessed
25 valuation of the taxable property in the tax increment area exceeds
26 the total assessed value of the taxable property in the tax
27 increment area as shown by the last equalized assessment roll
28 referred to in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected
29 upon the taxable property in the tax increment area must be paid
30 into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When the loans,
31 advances and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereon, have been
32 paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable
33 property in the tax increment area must be paid into the funds of
34 the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are
35 paid.
36 6. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the
37 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5
38 which is attributable to any tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
39 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make
40 annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any
41 bonded indebtedness that was approved by a majority of the
42 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
43 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
44 paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
-
*AB462*

– 7 –
1 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to
2 the last taxation of the property before the effective date of the
3 ordinance, if that additional rate was approved by a majority of the
4 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
5 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
6 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
7 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was
8 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of
9 the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to,
10 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of the
11 taxing agency.
