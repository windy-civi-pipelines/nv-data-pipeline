Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or more
2 boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an incorporated city to
3 apply to the Office of Economic Development to create, operate and maintain an inland port
4 and inland port authority in a contiguous area that includes certain transportation
5 infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this
6 bill revise the Inland Port Authority Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and
7 maintenance of an industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing
8 provisions of the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
9 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial Park
10 Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section 11 requires
11 any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that includes or is
12 adjacent to an inland port.
Assembly Amendment No. 835 to Assembly Bill No. 462 First Reprint Page 4
13 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or industrial park
14 to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all or part of the inland port
15 or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special account for the payment of bonds or
16 other securities issued to defray the cost of certain projects within the inland port or industrial
17 park. If a participating entity designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the
18 allocation of a portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
19 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness incurred by
20 the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the
21 issuance of such bonds or securities by counties or incorporated cities that have created an
22 inland port or industrial park. Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or
23 industrial park which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment
24 area. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland Port
25 and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new definitions created by
26 this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and Industrial Park Authority Act.
27 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to section 5
28 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
29 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or industrial park
30 and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic Development.
31 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of directors and
32 sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16 of this bill adds an
33 additional director to the board if none of the participating entities in the authority is a city and
34 requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
35 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in this State
36 which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
37 School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway Program at every high school
38 in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to
39 prepare for employment as professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school
40 district, or a school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other
41 high schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the high
42 schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program. Section 25 requires a
43 school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school which offers the Program in
44 subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a bachelor’s degree in education and in
45 sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25
46 authorizes a school district to apply to the State Board of Education for an exemption from the
47 requirement to offer certain internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a
48 high school which is not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate
49 that the location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses impracticable.
50 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such a pupil,
51 who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the Program made by an
52 administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to request a hearing for
53 reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
54 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which offers the
55 Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or administrator who is
56 responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 replaces this
57 requirement with a requirement for a school district to ensure that at least one licensed teacher
58 be assigned full-time to implement and teach the Program at each high school which offers the
59 Program if more than two class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.
60 Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1) complete
61 at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education in the area of
62 teaching [;] or in approved dual credit courses in the area of teaching; and (2) participate
63 in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which is relevant to the field of
64 teaching.
65 [Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish certain State
66 Seals, including the State Seal of Biliteracy, the State Seal of Civics and the State Seal of
67 STEM, which may be affixed to the diploma and noted on the transcript of a pupil to
68 recognize that the pupil has met certain requirements. (NRS 388.591, 388.5933, 388.594)
69 Section 24 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to create a State Seal
70 of Teacher Training and requires each board of trustees of a school district that offers the
Assembly Amendment No. 835 to Assembly Bill No. 462 First Reprint Page 5
71 Program to affix the Seal to the diploma of and note the receipt of the Seal on the transcript of
72 each pupil who completes the Program.]
73 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide reimbursement
74 for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory fee paid to an
75 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education by a person who: (1) completed the
76 Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for
77 at least 3 consecutive school years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to
78 provide a partial reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have
79 worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
80 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill requires the Program to be
81 established in coordination with the Department of Education, and additionally requires
82 that to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a person must have
83 completed the application for federal student aid and have successfully completed at an
84 institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education a program to become a licensed teacher.
85 Section 19 also authorizes a person who was not able to complete the Program because of
86 circumstances beyond the control of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial
87 reimbursement from the State Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for such a
88 reimbursement or partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education
89 loans are not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
90 reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
91 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce [Development] Innovation to:
92 (1) establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2) establish a
93 program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for pupils enrolled in grades
94 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education. (NRS [232.985)] 232.985,
95 232.990) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs, as well as the Teacher
96 Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways programs. Section 22 requires a
97 school district which offers a career pathways program at a high school to [: (1) offer career
98 exploration opportunities in certain priority industries to pupils at each middle school or junior
99 high school which feeds into the high school; and (2)] designate a teacher or other licensed
100 educational personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to
101 coordinate career pathways programs.
102 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways Oversight
103 Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to measure the success of the
104 career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and success of the career pathways
105 programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit provided by the Nevada System of Higher
106 Education; (4) report certain findings to the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing
107 Committee on Education; and (5) identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to
108 oversee, implement and regulate the career pathways programs for different industries.
109 Section 23 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the
110 Department to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
111 support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.

20 purpose of creating a special account for the payment of bonds or securities
21 issued or loans, money advanced or indebtedness incurred to defray the costs of
22 an undertaking, as supplemented by the Local Government Securities Law.
23 2. If an inland port or industrial park is created by two or more

6 divided as follows:
7 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the rate upon which
8 the tax is levied each year by or for each of those taxing agencies upon the total

21 in the tax increment area exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property
22 in the tax increment area as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred
23 to in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable
24 property in the tax increment area must be paid into the funds of the respective
25 taxing agencies. When the loans, advances and indebtedness, if any, and interest
26 thereon, have been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the
27 taxable property in the tax increment area must be paid into the funds of the
28 respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are paid.

32 making the securities payable from any net pledged revenues or tax proceeds
33 accounted for in the tax increment account maintained by the participating entity
34 pursuant to section 5 of this act.

47 (b) of subsection 3, regardless of whether they are also payable in the manner
48 provided in paragraph (a) of subsection 3 or in both subsection 2 and paragraph
49 (a) of subsection 3:

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to economic development; authorizing the creation of an
industrial park in a contiguous area that meets certain requirements;
authorizing the creation of a tax increment area and the issuance of
bonds and other securities for certain projects within an inland port or
industrial park; [requiring a school district which offers certain career
pathways programs to offer career exploration opportunities at certain
middle and junior high schools;] requiring the designation of a [full-
time staff member] teacher or other licensed educational personnel
to coordinate career pathways programs at each high school which
offers such programs; creating the Career Pathways Oversight
Committee; requiring the appointment of a Career Pathways Oversight
Coordinator; [creating the State Seal of Teacher Training;] revising
provisions governing the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program;
revising provisions governing the program for reimbursement of
tuition and fees paid by teachers who completed the Program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or more
2 boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an incorporated city to
3 apply to the Office of Economic Development to create, operate and maintain an inland port
4 and inland port authority in a contiguous area that includes certain transportation
5 infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this
6 bill revise the Inland Port Authority Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and
7 maintenance of an industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing
8 provisions of the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
9 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial Park
10 Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section 11 requires
11 any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that includes or is
12 adjacent to an inland port.

Assembly Amendment No. 835 to Assembly Bill No. 462 First Reprint Page 4
13 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or industrial park
14 to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all or part of the inland port
15 or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special account for the payment of bonds or
16 other securities issued to defray the cost of certain projects within the inland port or industrial
17 park. If a participating entity designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the
18 allocation of a portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
19 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness incurred by
20 the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the
21 issuance of such bonds or securities by counties or incorporated cities that have created an
22 inland port or industrial park. Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or
23 industrial park which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment
24 area. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland Port
25 and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new definitions created by
26 this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and Industrial Park Authority Act.
27 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to section 5
28 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
29 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or industrial park
30 and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic Development.
31 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of directors and
32 sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16 of this bill adds an
33 additional director to the board if none of the participating entities in the authority is a city and
34 requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
35 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in this State
36 which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
37 School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway Program at every high school
38 in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to
39 prepare for employment as professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school
40 district, or a school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other
41 high schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the high
42 schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program. Section 25 requires a
43 school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school which offers the Program in
44 subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a bachelor’s degree in education and in
45 sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25
46 authorizes a school district to apply to the State Board of Education for an exemption from the
47 requirement to offer certain internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a
48 high school which is not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate
49 that the location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses impracticable.
50 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such a pupil,
51 who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the Program made by an
52 administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to request a hearing for
53 reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
54 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which offers the
55 Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or administrator who is
56 responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 replaces this
57 requirement with a requirement for a school district to ensure that at least one licensed teacher
58 be assigned full-time to implement and teach the Program at each high school which offers the
59 Program if more than two class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.
60 Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1) complete
61 at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education in the area of
62 teaching [;] or in approved dual credit courses in the area of teaching; and (2) participate
63 in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which is relevant to the field of
64 teaching.
65 [Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish certain State
66 Seals, including the State Seal of Biliteracy, the State Seal of Civics and the State Seal of
67 STEM, which may be affixed to the diploma and noted on the transcript of a pupil to
68 recognize that the pupil has met certain requirements. (NRS 388.591, 388.5933, 388.594)
69 Section 24 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to create a State Seal
70 of Teacher Training and requires each board of trustees of a school district that offers the

Assembly Amendment No. 835 to Assembly Bill No. 462 First Reprint Page 5
71 Program to affix the Seal to the diploma of and note the receipt of the Seal on the transcript of
72 each pupil who completes the Program.]
73 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide reimbursement
74 for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory fee paid to an
75 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education by a person who: (1) completed the
76 Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for
77 at least 3 consecutive school years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to
78 provide a partial reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have
79 worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
80 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill requires the Program to be
81 established in coordination with the Department of Education, and additionally requires
82 that to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a person must have
83 completed the application for federal student aid and have successfully completed at an
84 institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education a program to become a licensed teacher.
85 Section 19 also authorizes a person who was not able to complete the Program because of
86 circumstances beyond the control of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial
87 reimbursement from the State Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for such a
88 reimbursement or partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education
89 loans are not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
90 reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
91 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce [Development] Innovation to:
92 (1) establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2) establish a
93 program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for pupils enrolled in grades
94 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education. (NRS [232.985)] 232.985,
95 232.990) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs, as well as the Teacher
96 Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways programs. Section 22 requires a
97 school district which offers a career pathways program at a high school to [: (1) offer career
98 exploration opportunities in certain priority industries to pupils at each middle school or junior
99 high school which feeds into the high school; and (2)] designate a teacher or other licensed
100 educational personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to
101 coordinate career pathways programs.
102 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways Oversight
103 Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to measure the success of the
104 career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and success of the career pathways
105 programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit provided by the Nevada System of Higher
106 Education; (4) report certain findings to the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing
107 Committee on Education; and (5) identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to
108 oversee, implement and regulate the career pathways programs for different industries.
109 Section 23 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the
110 Department to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
111 support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

15 Sec. 5. 1. If an inland port or industrial park is created by one
16 participating entity, the participating entity, on behalf of the county or
17 incorporated city in which the inland port or industrial park is located, may adopt
18 an ordinance creating a tax increment area within the inland port or industrial
19 park consisting of all or any portion of the inland port or industrial park for the
20 purpose of creating a special account for the payment of bonds or securities
21 issued or loans, money advanced or indebtedness incurred to defray the costs of
22 an undertaking, as supplemented by the Local Government Securities Law.
23 2. If an inland port or industrial park is created by two or more
24 participating entities, the participating entities may enter into an interlocal or
25 cooperative agreement for the ordering of an undertaking whose boundaries
26 encompass all or part of the inland port or industrial park and the creation of a
27 tax increment area and the tax increment account pertaining thereto. A tax
28 increment area created pursuant to this subsection must be administered as
29 provided in the interlocal or cooperative agreement, notwithstanding any
30 provision of this section to the contrary. If the participating entities enter into an
31 interlocal or cooperative agreement pursuant to this subsection, the participating
32 entities may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the interlocal or
33 cooperative agreement:
34 (a) Jointly take any action required to be taken by a participating entity for
35 the creation of a tax increment area pursuant to this section, except that each
36 participating entity must adopt an ordinance in order to create the tax increment
37 area;
38 (b) Enter into contracts for the undertaking; and
39 (c) Issue bonds or otherwise finance the cost of the undertaking.
40 3. A participating entity may amend an ordinance creating a tax increment
41 area pursuant to this section by adopting a supplemental ordinance to:
42 (a) Modify the undertaking by specifying new undertakings or removing or
43 modifying undertakings specified in the original ordinance.
44 (b) Add areas to or remove areas from a tax increment area.
45  The amount of taxes to be allocated to a tax increment account pursuant to
46 subsection 5 must be computed separately for the original tax increment area and
47 each addition of land thereto.
48 4. A participating entity shall not adopt an ordinance creating a tax
49 increment area pursuant to this section unless:
50 (a) The board has determined that the undertaking described in the
51 ordinance is necessary or desirable to further the purposes of the inland port or
52 industrial park.

Assembly Amendment No. 835 to Assembly Bill No. 462 First Reprint Page 7
1 (b) The participating entity makes a finding at a public hearing that the
2 undertaking will benefit the inland port or industrial park.
3 5. After the effective date of the ordinance adopted pursuant to subsection
4 1, any taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each year by
5 or for the benefit of the State, the municipality and any public body must be
6 divided as follows:
7 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the rate upon which
8 the tax is levied each year by or for each of those taxing agencies upon the total
9 sum of the assessed value of the taxable property in the tax increment area as
10 shown upon the last equalized assessment roll used in connection with the
11 taxation of the property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to, and when
12 collected must be paid into, the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes by
13 or for the taxing agencies on all other property are paid.
14 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of the taxes
15 levied each year in excess of the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a)
16 must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid into, the tax increment
17 account pertaining to the undertaking to pay the bond requirements of loans,
18 money advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed or
19 otherwise, incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance, in whole or in
20 part, the undertaking. Unless the total assessed valuation of the taxable property
21 in the tax increment area exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable property
22 in the tax increment area as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred
23 to in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable
24 property in the tax increment area must be paid into the funds of the respective
25 taxing agencies. When the loans, advances and indebtedness, if any, and interest
26 thereon, have been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the
27 taxable property in the tax increment area must be paid into the funds of the
28 respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are paid.
29 6. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the amount
30 determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5 which is attributable to any
31 tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
32 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make annual repayments
33 of the principal of, and the interest on, any bonded indebtedness that was
34 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of the taxing
