Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or more
2 boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an incorporated city to
3 apply to the Office of Economic Development to create, operate and maintain an inland port
4 and inland port authority in a contiguous area that includes certain transportation
5 infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this
6 bill revise the Inland Port Authority Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and
7 maintenance of an industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing
8 provisions of the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8

Assembly Amendment No. 265 to Assembly Bill No. 462 Page 4
9 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial Park
10 Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section 11 requires
11 any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that includes or is
12 adjacent to an inland port.
13 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or industrial park
14 to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all or part of the inland port
15 or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special account for the payment of bonds or
16 other securities issued to defray the cost of certain projects within the inland port or industrial
17 park. If a participating entity designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the
18 allocation of a portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
19 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness incurred by
20 the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the
21 issuance of such bonds or securities by counties or incorporated cities that have created an
22 inland port or industrial park. Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or
23 industrial park which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment
24 area. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland Port
25 and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new definitions created by
26 this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and Industrial Park Authority Act.
27 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to section 5
28 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
29 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or industrial park
30 and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic Development.
31 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of directors and
32 sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16 of this bill adds an
33 additional director to the board if none of the participating entities in the authority is a city and
34 requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
35 Existing law : (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in this
36 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark
37 County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway Program at every high
38 school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12
39 to prepare for employment as professionals in K-12 education ; and (2) authorizes a large
40 school district, or a school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at
41 other high schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the
42 high schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program. Section 25
43 requires a school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school which offers the
44 Program in subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a bachelor’s degree in
45 education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain at least [2] 12 units of college
46 credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to the State Board of Education for an
47 exemption from the requirement to offer certain internships and dual credit courses as part of
48 the Program at a high school which is not located in an incorporated city if the school district
49 can demonstrate that the location of the high school makes providing such internships or
50 courses impracticable.
51 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such a pupil,
52 who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the Program made by an
53 administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to request a hearing for
54 reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
55 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which offers the
56 Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or administrator who is
57 responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 replaces this
58 requirement with a requirement for a school district to ensure that at least one licensed teacher
59 [is] be assigned full-time to implement and teach the Program at each high school which
60 offers the Program [.] if more than two class periods in the Program will be offered at the
61 high school.
62 Section 25 requires that for a pupil [,] to complete the Program, [to:] the pupil must: (1)
63 complete at least 2 [units of college credit in certain courses and internships or complete]
64 academic years in a program of career and technical education in the area of teaching; and
65 (2) participate in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which is relevant to
66 the field of teaching.

Assembly Amendment No. 265 to Assembly Bill No. 462 Page 5
67 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish certain State
68 Seals, including the State Seal of Biliteracy, the State Seal of Civics and the State Seal of
69 STEM, which may be affixed to the diploma and noted on the transcript of a pupil to
70 recognize that the pupil has met certain requirements. (NRS 388.591, 388.5933, 388.594)
71 Section 24 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to create a State Seal
72 of Teacher Training and requires each board of trustees of a school district that offers the
73 Program to affix the Seal to the diploma of and note the receipt of the Seal on the transcript of
74 each pupil who completes the Program.
75 [Existing law requires the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to waive the
76 payment of registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory fees assessed each
77 semester against certain students. (NRS 396.5443, 396.5449) Section 26 of this bill requires
78 the Board of Regents to waive the payment of registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
79 mandatory fees assessed each semester for a course of dual credit which a high school pupil
80 enrolls in as part of the Program, for the first 12 credit hours of such courses in which a high
81 school pupil enrolls. Section 26 requires the Board of Regents to grant a waiver of the
82 payment of any application or admission fee for an undergraduate program assessed against a
83 person who has completed the Program.]
84 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide reimbursement
85 for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other mandatory fee paid to an
86 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education by a person who: (1) completed the
87 Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for
88 at least 3 consecutive school years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized
89 to provide a partial reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and
90 who have worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1
91 year or 2 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill [removes the requirement
92 for a person to have worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school for at least 3
93 consecutive school years to receive such reimbursement and, instead, authorizes the State
94 Treasurer to provide] additionally requires that to be eligible for such a reimbursement [to
95 anyone who has completed the Program and] or partial reimbursement, a person must
96 have completed the application for federal student aid [.
97 Section 27 of this bill authorizes a phased-in implementation of the Program by requiring
98 a large school district to provide the Program at an increasing number of high schools with
99 250 or more pupils enrolled until August 1, 2033, by which date every high school in the
100 school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled, other than high schools which are exempt,
101 must provide the Program.] and have successfully completed at an institution in the
102 Nevada System of Higher Education a program to become a licensed teacher. Section 19
103 also authorizes a person who was not able to complete the Program because of
104 circumstances beyond the control of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial
105 reimbursement from the State Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for
106 such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that
107 student education loans are not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may
108 be applied to reduce the reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the
109 State Treasurer.
110 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Development to: (1) establish
111 and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2) establish a program for
112 work-based learning opportunities outside of school for pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in
113 coordination with the Department of Education. (NRS 232.985) Sections 22 and 23 of this
114 bill designate these programs, as well as the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as
115 career pathways programs. Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career
116 pathways program at a high school to: (1) offer career exploration opportunities in certain
117 priority industries to pupils at each middle school or junior high school which feeds into the
118 high school; and (2) designate a [full-time staff member] teacher or other licensed
119 educational personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school
120 to coordinate career pathways programs.
121 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways Oversight
122 Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to measure the success of the
123 career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and success of the career pathways
124 programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit provided by the Nevada System of Higher
125 Education; and (4) report [its] certain findings to the State Board and the Joint Interim

Assembly Amendment No. 265 to Assembly Bill No. 462 Page 6
126 Standing Committee on [Education.] ; and (5) identify state agencies with the jurisdiction
127 and expertise to oversee, implement and regulate the career pathways programs for
128 different industries. Section 23 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint
129 an employee of the Department to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to
130 provide certain technical support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.
