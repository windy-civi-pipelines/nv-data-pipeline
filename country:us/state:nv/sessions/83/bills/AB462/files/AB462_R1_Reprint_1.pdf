Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
2 more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
3 incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
4 operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
-
*AB462_R1*

– 2 –
5 that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
6 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
7 Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
8 industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
9 the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
10 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
11 Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section
12 11 requires any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that
13 includes or is adjacent to an inland port.
14 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
15 industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
16 or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
17 account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
18 certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
19 designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
20 portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
21 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
22 incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 7 of this
23 bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities by counties or incorporated
24 cities that have created an inland port or industrial park. Section 4 of this bill sets
25 forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park which may be undertaken
26 using the funding generated by the tax increment area. Section 3 of this bill defines
27 the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland Port and Industrial Park
28 Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new definitions created by this bill
29 to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and Industrial Park Authority Act.
30 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to
31 section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
32 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
33 industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
34 Development.
35 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
36 directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section
37 16 of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating
38 entities in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the
39 Governor.
40 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in
41 this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
42 (currently the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College
43 Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more
44 pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as
45 professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school district, or a
46 school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other high
47 schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the
48 high schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program.
49 Section 25 requires a school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school
50 which offers the Program in subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a
51 bachelor’s degree in education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain
52 at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to
53 the State Board of Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain
54 internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is
55 not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
56 location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses
57 impracticable.
58 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
59 a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
-
*AB462_R1*

– 3 –
60 Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
61 request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
62 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
63 offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
64 administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)
65 Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
66 ensure that at least one licensed teacher be assigned full-time to implement and
67 teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program if more than two
68 class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.
69 Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1)
70 complete at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education
71 in the area of teaching; and (2) participate in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid
72 work-based learning which is relevant to the field of teaching.
73 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish
74 certain State Seals, including the State Seal of Biliteracy, the State Seal of Civics
75 and the State Seal of STEM, which may be affixed to the diploma and noted on the
76 transcript of a pupil to recognize that the pupil has met certain requirements. (NRS
77 388.591, 388.5933, 388.594) Section 24 of this bill requires the Superintendent of
78 Public Instruction to create a State Seal of Teacher Training and requires each
79 board of trustees of a school district that offers the Program to affix the Seal to the
80 diploma of and note the receipt of the Seal on the transcript of each pupil who
81 completes the Program.
82 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
83 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
84 mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
85 by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
86 licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
87 years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide a partial
88 reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have worked
89 as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
90 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill additionally requires that
91 to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a person must
92 have completed the application for federal student aid and have successfully
93 completed at an institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education a program to
94 become a licensed teacher. Section 19 also authorizes a person who was not able to
95 complete the Program because of circumstances beyond the control of that person
96 to obtain the reimbursement or partial reimbursement from the State Treasurer, if
97 the person meets the other requirements for such a reimbursement or partial
98 reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education loans are not a
99 form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
100 reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
101 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Development to: (1)
102 establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
103 establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
104 pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
105 (NRS 232.985) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs, as well as
106 the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways programs.
107 Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways program at a
108 high school to: (1) offer career exploration opportunities in certain priority
109 industries to pupils at each middle school or junior high school which feeds into the
110 high school; and (2) designate a teacher or other licensed educational personnel,
111 including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to coordinate
112 career pathways programs.
113 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
114 Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
-
*AB462_R1*

– 4 –
115 measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
116 success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
117 provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (4) report certain findings to
118 the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (5)
119 identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to oversee, implement and
120 regulate the career pathways programs for different industries. Section 23 requires
121 the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the Department
122 to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
123 support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.
