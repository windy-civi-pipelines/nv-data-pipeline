certain requirements; authorizing the creation of a tax
increment area and the issuance of bonds and other securities
for certain projects within an inland port or industrial park;
requiring the designation of a teacher or other licensed
educational personnel to coordinate career pathways
programs at each high school which offers such programs;
creating the Career Pathways Oversight Committee; requiring

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section
11 requires any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that
includes or is adjacent to an inland port.

Section 2:
Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 5.5 of this
bill provides for the payment of prevailing wage with respect to work performed in
relation to an undertaking that receives an allocation of tax revenue pursuant to

Section 3:
section 5. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities
by counties or incorporated cities that have created an inland port or industrial park.

Section 4:
Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park
which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment area.

Section 5:
Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland
Port and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
definitions created by this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and
Industrial Park Authority Act.

Section 6:
Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to

Section 7:
section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.

Section 8:
Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
Development.
Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16
of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating entities
in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in
this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
(currently the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College
Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more
pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as
professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school district, or a
school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other high
schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the
high schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program.

Section 9:
Section 25 requires a school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school
which offers the Program in subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a
bachelor’s degree in education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain
at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to
the State Board of Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain
internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is
not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses
impracticable.

Section 10:
Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)

Section 11:
Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
ensure that at least one licensed teacher be assigned full-time to implement and
teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program if more than two
class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.

Section 12:
Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1)
complete at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education
in the area of teaching or in approved dual credit courses in the area of teaching;
and (2) participate in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which
is relevant to the field of teaching.
Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide a partial
reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have worked
as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill requires the Program to be
established in coordination with the Department of Education, and additionally
requires that to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a
person must have completed the application for federal student aid and have
successfully completed at an institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education
a program to become a licensed teacher. Section 19 also authorizes a person who
was not able to complete the Program because of circumstances beyond the control
of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial reimbursement from the State
Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for such a reimbursement or
partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education loans are
not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation to: (1)
establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
(NRS 232.985, 232.990) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs,
as well as the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways
programs. Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways
program at a high school to designate a teacher or other licensed educational
personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to
coordinate career pathways programs.

Section 13:
Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (4) report certain findings to
the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (5)
identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to oversee, implement and
regulate the career pathways programs for different industries. Section 23 requires
the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the Department
to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.

Assembly Bill No. 462–Assemblymember Backus
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to economic development; authorizing the
creation of an industrial park in a contiguous area that meets
certain requirements; authorizing the creation of a tax
increment area and the issuance of bonds and other securities
for certain projects within an inland port or industrial park;
requiring the designation of a teacher or other licensed
educational personnel to coordinate career pathways
programs at each high school which offers such programs;
creating the Career Pathways Oversight Committee; requiring
the appointment of a Career Pathways Oversight
Coordinator; revising provisions governing the Teacher
Academy College Pathway Program; revising provisions
governing the program for reimbursement of tuition and fees
paid by teachers who completed the Program; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section
11 requires any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that
includes or is adjacent to an inland port.
Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 5.5 of this
bill provides for the payment of prevailing wage with respect to work performed in
relation to an undertaking that receives an allocation of tax revenue pursuant to
section 5. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities
by counties or incorporated cities that have created an inland port or industrial park.
Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park
which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment area.
Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland
Port and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new
-

– 2 –
definitions created by this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and
Industrial Park Authority Act.
Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to
section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
Development.
Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16
of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating entities
in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in
this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
(currently the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College
Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more
pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as
professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school district, or a
school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other high
schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the
high schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program.
Section 25 requires a school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school
which offers the Program in subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a
bachelor’s degree in education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain
at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to
the State Board of Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain
internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is
not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses
impracticable.
Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)
Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
ensure that at least one licensed teacher be assigned full-time to implement and
teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program if more than two
class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.
Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1)
complete at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education
in the area of teaching or in approved dual credit courses in the area of teaching;
and (2) participate in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which
is relevant to the field of teaching.
Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide a partial
reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have worked
as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill requires the Program to be
established in coordination with the Department of Education, and additionally
requires that to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a
person must have completed the application for federal student aid and have
successfully completed at an institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education
a program to become a licensed teacher. Section 19 also authorizes a person who
was not able to complete the Program because of circumstances beyond the control
of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial reimbursement from the State
Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for such a reimbursement or
partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education loans are
not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation to: (1)
establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
(NRS 232.985, 232.990) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs,
as well as the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways
programs. Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways
program at a high school to designate a teacher or other licensed educational
personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to
coordinate career pathways programs.
Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (4) report certain findings to
the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (5)
identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to oversee, implement and
regulate the career pathways programs for different industries. Section 23 requires
the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the Department
to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.
