Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
2 more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
3 incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
4 operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
5 that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
6 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
7 Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
8 industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
-
*AB462_R3*
– 2 –
9 the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
10 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
11 Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section
12 11 requires any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that
13 includes or is adjacent to an inland port.
14 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
15 industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
16 or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
17 account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
18 certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
19 designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
20 portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
21 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
22 incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 5.5 of this
23 bill provides for the payment of prevailing wage with respect to work performed in
24 relation to an undertaking that receives an allocation of tax revenue pursuant to
25 section 5. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities
26 by counties or incorporated cities that have created an inland port or industrial park.
27 Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park
28 which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment area.
29 Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland
30 Port and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new
31 definitions created by this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and
32 Industrial Park Authority Act.
33 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to
34 section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
35 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
36 industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
37 Development.
38 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
39 directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16
40 of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating entities
41 in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
42 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in
43 this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
44 (currently the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College
45 Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more
46 pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as
47 professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school district, or a
48 school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other high
49 schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the
50 high schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program.
51 Section 25 requires a school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school
52 which offers the Program in subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a
53 bachelor’s degree in education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain
54 at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to
55 the State Board of Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain
56 internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is
57 not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
58 location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses
59 impracticable.
60 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
61 a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
62 Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
63 request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
-
*AB462_R3*
– 3 –
64 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
65 offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
66 administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)
67 Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
68 ensure that at least one licensed teacher be assigned full-time to implement and
69 teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program if more than two
70 class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.
71 Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1)
72 complete at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education
73 in the area of teaching or in approved dual credit courses in the area of teaching;
74 and (2) participate in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which
75 is relevant to the field of teaching.
76 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
77 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
78 mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
79 by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
80 licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
81 years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide a partial
82 reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have worked
83 as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
84 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill requires the Program to be
85 established in coordination with the Department of Education, and additionally
86 requires that to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a
87 person must have completed the application for federal student aid and have
88 successfully completed at an institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education
89 a program to become a licensed teacher. Section 19 also authorizes a person who
90 was not able to complete the Program because of circumstances beyond the control
91 of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial reimbursement from the State
92 Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for such a reimbursement or
93 partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education loans are
94 not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
95 reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
96 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation to: (1)
97 establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
98 establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
99 pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
100 (NRS 232.985, 232.990) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs,
101 as well as the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways
102 programs. Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways
103 program at a high school to designate a teacher or other licensed educational
104 personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to
105 coordinate career pathways programs.
106 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
107 Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
108 measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
109 success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
110 provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (4) report certain findings to
111 the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (5)
112 identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to oversee, implement and
113 regulate the career pathways programs for different industries. Section 23 requires
114 the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the Department
115 to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
116 support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Inland Port Authority Act, which authorizes one or
2 more boards of county commissioners of a county or governing bodies of an
3 incorporated city to apply to the Office of Economic Development to create,
4 operate and maintain an inland port and inland port authority in a contiguous area
5 that includes certain transportation infrastructure and no residential property. (NRS
6 277B.150) Sections 8-15, 17 and 18 of this bill revise the Inland Port Authority
7 Act to additionally authorize the creation, operation and maintenance of an
8 industrial park and an industrial park authority and makes the existing provisions of
-
*AB462_R3*

– 2 –
9 the Act applicable to industrial parks and industrial park authorities. Section 8
10 provides that the Act may now be known and cited as the Inland Port and Industrial
11 Park Authority Act. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “industrial park.” Section
12 11 requires any area designated as an “industrial park” to include only property that
13 includes or is adjacent to an inland port.
14 Section 5 of this bill authorizes a participating entity in an inland port or
15 industrial park to adopt an ordinance creating a tax increment area consisting of all
16 or part of the inland port or industrial park for the purpose of creating a special
17 account for the payment of bonds or other securities issued to defray the cost of
18 certain projects within the inland port or industrial park. If a participating entity
19 designates such a tax increment area, section 5 provides for the allocation of a
20 portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax increment area each
21 year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to, or indebtedness
22 incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the project. Section 5.5 of this
23 bill provides for the payment of prevailing wage with respect to work performed in
24 relation to an undertaking that receives an allocation of tax revenue pursuant to
25 section 5. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the issuance of such bonds or securities
26 by counties or incorporated cities that have created an inland port or industrial park.
27 Section 4 of this bill sets forth the projects of an inland port or industrial park
28 which may be undertaken using the funding generated by the tax increment area.
29 Section 3 of this bill defines the term “municipality” for the purposes of the Inland
30 Port and Industrial Park Authority Act. Section 9 of this bill applies the new
31 definitions created by this bill to the existing provisions of the Inland Port and
32 Industrial Park Authority Act.
33 Sections 6 and 20 of this bill exempt a tax increment area created pursuant to
34 section 5 from certain limits on revenue from taxes ad valorem.
35 Section 12 authorizes the Office to initiate the creation of an inland port or
36 industrial park and authority with the approval of the Board of Economic
37 Development.
38 Existing law requires an inland port authority to be governed by a board of
39 directors and sets forth the composition of such a board. (NRS 277B.200) Section 16
40 of this bill adds an additional director to the board if none of the participating entities
41 in the authority is a city and requires this director to be appointed by the Governor.
42 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district, meaning a school district in
43 this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
44 (currently the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College
45 Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more
46 pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment as
47 professionals in K-12 education; and (2) authorizes a large school district, or a
48 school district which is not a large school district, to offer the Program at other high
49 schools. (NRS 388.223) Section 25 of this bill excludes specialty schools from the
50 high schools at which a large school district is required to offer the Program.
51 Section 25 requires a school district to offer dual credit courses at each high school
52 which offers the Program in subjects which align with the requirements to obtain a
53 bachelor’s degree in education and in sufficient quantity to allow a pupil to obtain
54 at least 12 units of college credit. Section 25 authorizes a school district to apply to
55 the State Board of Education for an exemption from the requirement to offer certain
56 internships and dual credit courses as part of the Program at a high school which is
57 not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
58 location of the high school makes providing such internships or courses
59 impracticable.
60 Section 25 authorizes a high school pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of such
61 a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
62 Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board of trustees to
63 request a hearing for reconsideration of the decision by the board of trustees.
-
*AB462_R3*

– 3 –
64 Existing law requires a school district to ensure that each high school which
65 offers the Program is staffed by a full-time employee who is a licensed teacher or
66 administrator who is responsible for implementing the Program. (NRS 388.223)
67 Section 25 replaces this requirement with a requirement for a school district to
68 ensure that at least one licensed teacher be assigned full-time to implement and
69 teach the Program at each high school which offers the Program if more than two
70 class periods in the Program will be offered at the high school.
71 Section 25 requires that for a pupil to complete the Program, the pupil must: (1)
72 complete at least 2 academic years in a program of career and technical education
73 in the area of teaching or in approved dual credit courses in the area of teaching;
74 and (2) participate in at least 15 hours of paid or unpaid work-based learning which
75 is relevant to the field of teaching.
76 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
77 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
78 mandatory fee paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
79 by a person who: (1) completed the Program; and (2) has worked as a full-time,
80 licensed teacher at a public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school
81 years. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide a partial
82 reimbursement to persons who have completed the Program and who have worked
83 as a full-time, licensed teacher at a public school in this State for 1 year or 2
84 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 19 of this bill requires the Program to be
85 established in coordination with the Department of Education, and additionally
86 requires that to be eligible for such a reimbursement or partial reimbursement, a
87 person must have completed the application for federal student aid and have
88 successfully completed at an institution in the Nevada System of Higher Education
89 a program to become a licensed teacher. Section 19 also authorizes a person who
90 was not able to complete the Program because of circumstances beyond the control
91 of that person to obtain the reimbursement or partial reimbursement from the State
92 Treasurer, if the person meets the other requirements for such a reimbursement or
93 partial reimbursement. Finally, section 19 provides that student education loans are
94 not a form of financial aid or financial assistance that may be applied to reduce the
95 reimbursement or partial reimbursement received from the State Treasurer.
96 Existing law requires the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation to: (1)
97 establish and administer a Career Pathways Demonstration Program; and (2)
98 establish a program for work-based learning opportunities outside of school for
99 pupils enrolled in grades 7 to 12, in coordination with the Department of Education.
100 (NRS 232.985, 232.990) Sections 22 and 23 of this bill designate these programs,
101 as well as the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, as career pathways
102 programs. Section 22 requires a school district which offers a career pathways
103 program at a high school to designate a teacher or other licensed educational
104 personnel, including, without limitation a school counselor, at the high school to
105 coordinate career pathways programs.
106 Section 23 creates within the Department of Education a Career Pathways
107 Oversight Committee and requires the Committee to: (1) establish metrics to
108 measure the success of the career pathways programs; (2) evaluate the progress and
109 success of the career pathways programs; (3) evaluate programs for dual credit
110 provided by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (4) report certain findings to
111 the State Board and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (5)
112 identify state agencies with the jurisdiction and expertise to oversee, implement and
113 regulate the career pathways programs for different industries. Section 23 requires
114 the Superintendent of Public Instruction to appoint an employee of the Department
115 to act as the Career Pathways Oversight Coordinator to provide certain technical
116 support and assistance in implementing career pathways programs.

*AB462_R3*

– 5 –
1 undertaking whose boundaries encompass all or part of the inland
2 port or industrial park and the creation of a tax increment area
3 and the tax increment account pertaining thereto. A tax increment
4 area created pursuant to this subsection must be administered as
5 provided in the interlocal or cooperative agreement,
6 notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary. If
7 the participating entities enter into an interlocal or cooperative
8 agreement pursuant to this subsection, the participating entities
9 may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the interlocal
10 or cooperative agreement:
11 (a) Jointly take any action required to be taken by a

14 adopt an ordinance in order to create the tax increment area;
15 (b) Enter into contracts for the undertaking; and
16 (c) Issue bonds or otherwise finance the cost of the
17 undertaking.
18 3. A participating entity may amend an ordinance creating a
19 tax increment area pursuant to this section by adopting a
20 supplemental ordinance to:
21 (a) Modify the undertaking by specifying new undertakings or

26 pursuant to subsection 5 must be computed separately for the
27 original tax increment area and each addition of land thereto.
28 4. A participating entity shall not adopt an ordinance creating
29 a tax increment area pursuant to this section unless:
30 (a) The board has determined that the undertaking described
31 in the ordinance is necessary or desirable to further the purposes
32 of the inland port or industrial park.
33 (b) The participating entity makes a finding at a public

36 5. After the effective date of the ordinance adopted pursuant
37 to subsection 1, any taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax
38 increment area each year by or for the benefit of the State, the
39 municipality and any public body must be divided as follows:
40 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the
41 rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of those
42 taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the
43 taxable property in the tax increment area as shown upon the last
44 equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
45 the property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to, and when
-
*AB462_R3*

– 6 –
1 collected must be paid into, the funds of the respective taxing
2 agencies as taxes by or for the taxing agencies on all other
3 property are paid.
4 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of
5 the taxes levied each year in excess of the amount determined
6 pursuant to paragraph (a) must be allocated to, and when
7 collected must be paid into, the tax increment account pertaining
8 to the undertaking to pay the bond requirements of loans, money
9 advanced to, or indebtedness, whether funded, refunded, assumed
10 or otherwise, incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance,
11 in whole or in part, the undertaking. Unless the total assessed
12 valuation of the taxable property in the tax increment area exceeds
13 the total assessed value of the taxable property in the tax
14 increment area as shown by the last equalized assessment roll
15 referred to in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected
16 upon the taxable property in the tax increment area must be paid
17 into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When the loans,
18 advances and indebtedness, if any, and interest thereon, have been
19 paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable
20 property in the tax increment area must be paid into the funds of
21 the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other property are
22 paid.
23 6. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the
24 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5
25 which is attributable to any tax rate levied by a taxing agency:

27 annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any
28 bonded indebtedness that was approved by a majority of the
29 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
30 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
31 paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
32 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to
33 the last taxation of the property before the effective date of the
34 ordinance, if that additional rate was approved by a majority of the
35 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
36 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
37 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
38 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was
39 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of
40 the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to,
41 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of the
42 taxing agency.
43 (d) For the support of the public schools within a county
44 school district pursuant to NRS 387.195, must be allocated to, and
45 when collected must be paid into, the State Education Fund.
-
*AB462_R3*

– 7 –
1 7. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 6 include,
2 without limitation, a tax rate approved for bonds of a county
3 school district issued pursuant to NRS 350.020, including, without
4 limitation, amounts necessary for a reserve account in the debt
5 service fund.
6 8. A tax increment area must expire not more than 30 years
7 after the date on which the ordinance which creates the area
8 becomes effective.
9 9. As used in this section, the term “last equalized assessment
10 roll” means the assessment roll in existence on the 15th day of
11 March immediately preceding the effective date of the ordinance.
12 Sec. 5.5. The provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,
13 inclusive, apply to any construction work to be performed under
14 any contract or other agreement related to any undertaking
15 pursuant to this chapter. With respect to the undertaking, the
16 participating entity, the owner of any property within a tax
17 increment area created pursuant to this chapter, the developer,
18 any contractor who is awarded the contract or enters into the
19 agreement to perform the construction work and any
20 subcontractor who performs any portion of the construction work
21 related to such an undertaking shall comply with the provisions of
22 NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the
23 participating entity had undertaken the undertaking or had
24 awarded the contract.
25 Sec. 6. The allowed revenue from taxes ad valorem
26 determined pursuant to NRS 354.59811 does not apply to a tax
27 increment area created pursuant to this chapter.
28 Sec. 7. 1. To defray in whole or in part the cost of any
29 undertaking, a participating entity may issue the following
30 securities:
31 (a) Notes;
32 (b) Warrants;
33 (c) Interim debentures;
34 (d) Bonds; and
35 (e) Temporary bonds.
36 2. Any net revenues derived from the operation of an
37 undertaking supported by the issuance of securities pursuant to
38 this section must be pledged for the payment of the securities. The
