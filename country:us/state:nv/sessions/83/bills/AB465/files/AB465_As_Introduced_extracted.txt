Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this
2 State and provides that each school district has the power to be sued. (NRS
3 386.010) Existing law also establishes provisions relating to the handling of power-
4 based violence at institutions within the Nevada System of Higher Education. (NRS
5 396.125-396.1595) Section 14 of this bill provides that a school district is civilly
6 liable if an agent, employee or authorized person of the school district engages in
7 harassment against a person who participates in or receives an aid, benefit, service
8 or opportunity from an education program or activity of the school district or a
9 school within the school district, or who attempts to participate in or receive any
10 aid, benefit, service or opportunity from such a program or activity, regardless of
11 where the incident occurs, if the incident of harassment is: (1) enabled or assisted
-

– 2 –
12 by the authority exercised as an agent, employee or authorized person; or (2) the
13 school district receives notice of the incident. Section 14 additionally provides that
14 a school district is civilly liable if a person who is not an agent, employee or
15 authorized person of the school district engages in harassment if the school district
16 received notice of the incident. Section 15 of this bill sets forth the criteria for
17 determining when a school district receives notice of an incident of harassment.
18 Section 16 of this bill creates an affirmative defense for a school district if it
19 demonstrates that it: (1) established, adequately published and enforced certain
20 policies, procedures and training concerning harassment; (2) provided supportive
21 measures within 3 days of receiving notice of the incident; (3) under certain
22 circumstances, undertook a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; (4) after
23 obtaining consent to do so, facilitated a disciplinary process in accordance with
24 practices based on restorative justice; and (5) took other necessary, prompt and
25 appropriate corrective action. Sections 27-29 of this bill set forth similar provisions
26 for institutions within the System.
27 Sections 17 and 30 of this bill: (1) require the board of trustees of each school
28 district and authorize an institution within the System, respectively, to designate
29 one employee to serve as a confidential employee; and (2) set forth the
30 responsibilities of the confidential employee. Sections 17 and 30 additionally
31 require the board of trustees of each school district and authorize the Board of
32 Regents, respectively, to: (1) direct a civil rights coordinator to perform certain
33 duties; (2) address reports of retaliation against a complainant, reporting party or
34 witness; and (3) prohibit a school district or institution within the System, as
35 applicable, from taking certain actions, including, without limitation, disciplinary
36 actions, against a complainant, reporting party or witness.
37 Sections 3-13 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 14-
38 17. Sections 20-26 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 27-
39 30. Section 31 provides that: (1) the terms defined in sections 20-26 apply to
40 provisions governing the handling of power-based violence at institutions within
41 the System; and (2) certain terms relating to power-based violence apply to
42 sections 20-30.
43 Section 32 of this bill revises the definition of the term “complainant” to
44 include a student or employee of an institution within the System who is alleged to
45 be the victim of conduct that could constitute harassment. (NRS 396.126) Section
46 33 of this bill revises the term “respondent” to include a person reported for
47 conduct that could constitute harassment. (NRS 396.131) Section 34 of this bill
48 revises the definition of “sexual harassment” to conform with the definition for the
49 term “sexual harassment” used for the purposes of public schools, as set forth in
50 section 10. (NRS 396.133) Section 35 of this bill revises the definition of the term
51 “supportive measures” to reflect a change in the citation to the relevant federal
52 regulation. (NRS 396.137)
53 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to appoint researchers to develop
54 a climate survey on power-based violence designed to be administered at
55 institutions within the System. (NRS 396.142) If the Board of Regents requires
56 administration of the survey, existing law additionally sets forth: (1) requirements
57 for the contents and offering of the survey; and (2) the duties of the Board of
58 Regents in storing and disseminating the responses to the survey. (NRS 396.1425,
59 396.143) Under existing law, the Board of Regents is authorized to: (1) prohibit an
60 institution within the System from subjecting a complainant, reporting party or
61 witness who reports an alleged incident of power-based violence to disciplinary
62 proceedings for certain violations of policies on student conduct; and (2) require an
63 institution within the System to review such disciplinary action to determine if
64 there is a connection between the alleged incident of power-based violence and the
65 misconduct that led to such disciplinary action. (NRS 396.151) Section 18 of this
66 bill similarly authorizes the board of trustees of each school district to prohibit a
-
*AB465*
– 3 –
67 school within the school district from subjecting a complainant, reporting party or
68 witness who reports an alleged incident of harassment to disciplinary proceedings
69 under certain circumstances. Section 22: (1) defines the term “harassment” for the
70 purposes of provisions relating to harassment at institutions within the System; and
71 (2) includes incidents of power-based violence as incidents of harassment. Sections
72 37-41 of this bill replace the term “power-based violence” with “harassment,”
73 thereby: (1) authorizing the Board of Regents to appoint researchers to develop a
74 climate survey on harassment; and (2) applying the provisions of those sections to
75 incidents of harassment, as defined in section 22.

A.B. 465
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 465–ASSEMBLYMEMBER MILLER
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 34-927)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; providing that a school district or
institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education
is civilly liable for the actions of certain persons that
constitute harassment; setting forth requirements
governing when an entity receives notice of such actions;
creating affirmative defenses for such actions; prohibiting
certain actions by a school district and authorizing the
Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to prohibit
certain actions by an institution within the System relating
to harassment; providing requirements for certain persons
designated to receive certain complaints and coordinate
compliance with certain federal laws; revising provisions
governing a climate survey on power-based violence;
defining certain terms relating to incidents of harassment;
revising certain terms; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this
2 State and provides that each school district has the power to be sued. (NRS
3 386.010) Existing law also establishes provisions relating to the handling of power-
4 based violence at institutions within the Nevada System of Higher Education. (NRS
5 396.125-396.1595) Section 14 of this bill provides that a school district is civilly
6 liable if an agent, employee or authorized person of the school district engages in
7 harassment against a person who participates in or receives an aid, benefit, service
8 or opportunity from an education program or activity of the school district or a
9 school within the school district, or who attempts to participate in or receive any
10 aid, benefit, service or opportunity from such a program or activity, regardless of
11 where the incident occurs, if the incident of harassment is: (1) enabled or assisted
-
*AB465*

– 2 –
12 by the authority exercised as an agent, employee or authorized person; or (2) the
13 school district receives notice of the incident. Section 14 additionally provides that
14 a school district is civilly liable if a person who is not an agent, employee or
15 authorized person of the school district engages in harassment if the school district
16 received notice of the incident. Section 15 of this bill sets forth the criteria for
17 determining when a school district receives notice of an incident of harassment.
18 Section 16 of this bill creates an affirmative defense for a school district if it
19 demonstrates that it: (1) established, adequately published and enforced certain
20 policies, procedures and training concerning harassment; (2) provided supportive
21 measures within 3 days of receiving notice of the incident; (3) under certain
22 circumstances, undertook a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; (4) after
23 obtaining consent to do so, facilitated a disciplinary process in accordance with
24 practices based on restorative justice; and (5) took other necessary, prompt and
25 appropriate corrective action. Sections 27-29 of this bill set forth similar provisions
26 for institutions within the System.
27 Sections 17 and 30 of this bill: (1) require the board of trustees of each school
28 district and authorize an institution within the System, respectively, to designate
29 one employee to serve as a confidential employee; and (2) set forth the
30 responsibilities of the confidential employee. Sections 17 and 30 additionally
31 require the board of trustees of each school district and authorize the Board of
32 Regents, respectively, to: (1) direct a civil rights coordinator to perform certain
33 duties; (2) address reports of retaliation against a complainant, reporting party or
34 witness; and (3) prohibit a school district or institution within the System, as
35 applicable, from taking certain actions, including, without limitation, disciplinary
36 actions, against a complainant, reporting party or witness.
37 Sections 3-13 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 14-
38 17. Sections 20-26 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 27-
39 30. Section 31 provides that: (1) the terms defined in sections 20-26 apply to
40 provisions governing the handling of power-based violence at institutions within
41 the System; and (2) certain terms relating to power-based violence apply to
42 sections 20-30.
43 Section 32 of this bill revises the definition of the term “complainant” to
44 include a student or employee of an institution within the System who is alleged to
45 be the victim of conduct that could constitute harassment. (NRS 396.126) Section
46 33 of this bill revises the term “respondent” to include a person reported for
47 conduct that could constitute harassment. (NRS 396.131) Section 34 of this bill
48 revises the definition of “sexual harassment” to conform with the definition for the
49 term “sexual harassment” used for the purposes of public schools, as set forth in
50 section 10. (NRS 396.133) Section 35 of this bill revises the definition of the term
51 “supportive measures” to reflect a change in the citation to the relevant federal
52 regulation. (NRS 396.137)
53 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to appoint researchers to develop
54 a climate survey on power-based violence designed to be administered at
55 institutions within the System. (NRS 396.142) If the Board of Regents requires
56 administration of the survey, existing law additionally sets forth: (1) requirements
57 for the contents and offering of the survey; and (2) the duties of the Board of
58 Regents in storing and disseminating the responses to the survey. (NRS 396.1425,
59 396.143) Under existing law, the Board of Regents is authorized to: (1) prohibit an
60 institution within the System from subjecting a complainant, reporting party or
61 witness who reports an alleged incident of power-based violence to disciplinary
62 proceedings for certain violations of policies on student conduct; and (2) require an
63 institution within the System to review such disciplinary action to determine if
64 there is a connection between the alleged incident of power-based violence and the
65 misconduct that led to such disciplinary action. (NRS 396.151) Section 18 of this
66 bill similarly authorizes the board of trustees of each school district to prohibit a
-
*AB465*

– 3 –
67 school within the school district from subjecting a complainant, reporting party or
68 witness who reports an alleged incident of harassment to disciplinary proceedings
69 under certain circumstances. Section 22: (1) defines the term “harassment” for the
70 purposes of provisions relating to harassment at institutions within the System; and
71 (2) includes incidents of power-based violence as incidents of harassment. Sections
72 37-41 of this bill replace the term “power-based violence” with “harassment,”
73 thereby: (1) authorizing the Board of Regents to appoint researchers to develop a
74 climate survey on harassment; and (2) applying the provisions of those sections to
75 incidents of harassment, as defined in section 22.

38 as a prerequisite to obtaining supportive measures, participating
39 in an investigation or informal resolution or asserting any other
40 rights under federal or state law and shall not discipline a
