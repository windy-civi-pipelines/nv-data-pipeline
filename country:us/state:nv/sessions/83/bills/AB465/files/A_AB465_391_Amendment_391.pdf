climate survey on power-based violence; defining certain terms
relating to incidents of harassment; revising certain terms;] if the
school district, charter school or institution establishes, publishes
and enforces a policy containing certain provisions; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this State and
2 provides that each school district has the power to be sued. (NRS 386.010) Existing law also
3 establishes provisions relating to the handling of power-based violence at institutions within
4 the Nevada System of Higher Education. (NRS 396.125-396.1595) [Section 14 of this bill
5 provides that a school district is civilly liable if an agent, employee or authorized person of the
6 school district engages in harassment against a person who participates in or receives an aid,
7 benefit, service or opportunity from an education program or activity of the school district or a
8 school within the school district, or who attempts to participate in or receive any aid, benefit,
9 service or opportunity from such a program or activity, regardless of where the incident
10 occurs, if the incident of harassment is: (1) enabled or assisted by the authority exercised as an
11 agent, employee or authorized person; or (2) the school district receives notice of the incident.
12 Section 14 additionally provides that a school district is civilly liable if a person who is not an
13 agent, employee or authorized person of the school district engages in harassment if the
14 school district received notice of the incident. Section 15 of this bill sets forth the criteria for
15 determining when a school district receives notice of an incident of harassment.] Section 16
16 of this bill [creates an affirmative defense for] : (1) makes a school district or charter school

Assembly Amendment No. 391 to Assembly Bill No. 465 Page 4
17 immune from civil liability for incidents of harassment by pupils or staff if it
18 demonstrates that it [: (1)] established, adequately published and enforced certain policies,
19 procedures and training concerning harassment; and (2) [provided supportive measures within
20 3 days of receiving notice of the incident; (3) under certain circumstances, undertook a
21 prompt, thorough and impartial investigation; (4) after obtaining consent to do so, facilitated a
22 disciplinary process in accordance with practices based on restorative justice; and (5) took
23 other necessary, prompt and appropriate corrective action. Sections 27-29] requires such a
24 policy to include certain provisions. Section 29 of this bill [set] sets forth similar provisions
25 for institutions within the System.
26 [Sections 17 and 30 of this bill: (1) require the board of trustees of each school district
27 and authorize an institution within the System, respectively, to designate one employee to
28 serve as a confidential employee; and (2) set forth the responsibilities of the confidential
29 employee. Sections 17 and 30 additionally require the board of trustees of each school district
30 and authorize the Board of Regents, respectively, to: (1) direct a civil rights coordinator to
31 perform certain duties; (2) address reports of retaliation against a complainant, reporting party
32 or witness; and (3) prohibit a school district or institution within the System, as applicable,
33 from taking certain actions, including, without limitation, disciplinary actions, against a
34 complainant, reporting party or witness.
35 Sections 3-13 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 14-17. Sections
36 20-26 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 27-30. Section 31 provides
37 that: (1) the terms defined in sections 20-26 apply to provisions governing the handling of
38 power-based violence at institutions within the System; and (2) certain terms relating to
39 power-based violence apply to sections 20-30.
40 Section 32 of this bill revises the definition of the term “complainant” to include a student
41 or employee of an institution within the System who is alleged to be the victim of conduct that
42 could constitute harassment. (NRS 396.126) Section 33 of this bill revises the term
43 “respondent” to include a person reported for conduct that could constitute harassment. (NRS
44 396.131) Section 34 of this bill revises the definition of “sexual harassment” to conform with
45 the definition for the term “sexual harassment” used for the purposes of public schools, as set
46 forth in section 10. (NRS 396.133) Section 35 of this bill revises the definition of the term
47 “supportive measures” to reflect a change in the citation to the relevant federal regulation.
48 (NRS 396.137)
49 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to appoint researchers to develop a climate
50 survey on power-based violence designed to be administered at institutions within the System.
51 (NRS 396.142) If the Board of Regents requires administration of the survey, existing law
52 additionally sets forth: (1) requirements for the contents and offering of the survey; and (2) the
53 duties of the Board of Regents in storing and disseminating the responses to the survey. (NRS
54 396.1425, 396.143) Under existing law, the Board of Regents is authorized to: (1) prohibit an
55 institution within the System from subjecting a complainant, reporting party or witness who
56 reports an alleged incident of power-based violence to disciplinary proceedings for certain
57 violations of policies on student conduct; and (2) require an institution within the System to
58 review such disciplinary action to determine if there is a connection between the alleged
59 incident of power-based violence and the misconduct that led to such disciplinary action.
60 (NRS 396.151) Section 18 of this bill similarly authorizes the board of trustees of each school
61 district to prohibit a school within the school district from subjecting a complainant, reporting
62 party or witness who reports an alleged incident of harassment to disciplinary proceedings
63 under certain circumstances. Section 22: (1) defines the term “harassment” for the purposes of
64 provisions relating to harassment at institutions within the System; and (2) includes incidents
65 of power-based violence as incidents of harassment. Sections 37-41 of this bill replace the
66 term “power-based violence” with “harassment,” thereby: (1) authorizing the Board of
67 Regents to appoint researchers to develop a climate survey on harassment; and (2) applying
68 the provisions of those sections to incidents of harassment, as defined in section 22.]
