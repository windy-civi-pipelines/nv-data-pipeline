Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates county school districts as political subdivisions of this
2 State and provides that each school district has the power to be sued. (NRS

4 based violence at institutions within the Nevada System of Higher Education. (NRS

6 school immune from civil liability for incidents of harassment by pupils or staff if it
7 demonstrates that it established, adequately published and enforced certain policies,
8 procedures and training concerning harassment; and (2) requires such a policy to
9 include certain provisions. Section 29 of this bill sets forth similar provisions for
10 institutions within the System.
