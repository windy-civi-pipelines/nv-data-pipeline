Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act governs how states and
2 public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to
3 pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.) Existing law requires public schools to
4 provide programs and services for pupils with disabilities. (NRS 388.419, 388.429) Section
5 [1] 1.3 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
6 of each charter school to develop a policy governing the manner in which pupils with [autism
7 spectrum disorders] disabilities who have individualized education programs , or plans
8 developed pursuant to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794,
9 receive medically necessary treatment or services from private instructional personnel in a
10 school setting. Section [1] 1.3 additionally requires such a policy to: (1) require each school to

Senate Amendment No. 425 to Senate Bill No. 174 Page 4
11 provide notice to the parent or legal guardian of such a pupil of certain rights; (2) set forth
12 protocols for private educational personnel to observe such pupils, collaborate with
13 educational personnel and provide medically necessary treatment and other services; and (3)
14 comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Furthermore, section [1:] 1.3:
15 (1) prohibits a school district or charter school from charging certain fees relating to the
16 provision of certain services; (2) sets forth the only requirements a school district or charter
17 school is authorized to place on private instructional personnel; (3) requires the policy
18 developed by each school district and charter school to be made available on its Internet
19 website and to a parent or legal guardian who requests a copy; and (4) requires each school
20 district and charter school to compile a report containing certain information and submit such
21 a report to the Department of Education, which must submit the reports to certain legislative
22 bodies. Finally, section 1.3 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
23 governing body of a charter school to require the parent or legal guardian of certain
24 pupils with disabilities to sign a written acknowledgment concerning any private
25 instructional personnel and the provision of medically necessary treatment.
26 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to prescribe minimum standards
27 for the special education of pupils with visual impairments, including, without
28 limitation, blindness. (NRS 388.419) Section 2.5 of this bill requires such minimum
29 standards to include: (1) standards for the provision of instruction in Braille and the use
30 of Braille; and (2) guidelines for providing for and integrating assistive technology and
31 assistive technology services into instruction.
32 Existing law additionally requires an individualized education program team for a
33 pupil with a hearing impairment or a pupil with a hearing or visual impairment who is
34 less than 6 years of age to take certain factors into consideration and include certain
35 provisions when developing an individualized education program for the pupil. (NRS
36 388.437) Existing law also provides that a pupil is not required to take advantage of the
37 special provisions for the education of pupils with disabilities. (NRS 388.431) Section 4.5
38 of this bill requires the individualized education program team, when developing an
39 individualized education program for a pupil with a visual impairment, including,
40 without limitation, blindness, or a hearing impairment, including, without limitation,
41 deafness, to: (1) if the parent or legal guardian of the pupil requests that the pupil
42 receive instruction in Braille and the use of Braille, provide for such instruction; (2)
43 provide that the pupil receive any assistive technology and assistive technology services
44 necessary to provide the pupil with a free appropriate public education; and (3) prohibit
45 an employee of a school district or charter school from interfering with the ability of the
46 pupil to carry a cane or walking stick or use a mobility device while on school property.
47 Section 1.7 of this bill also provides that the ability of any pupil with such a disability,
48 including, without limitation, a pupil who elects not to take advantage of the special
49 provisions for the education of pupils with disabilities, may not have his or her right to
50 carry a cane or walking stick interfered with while on school property.
51 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: (1) requires, to the
52 maximum extent that is appropriate, children with disabilities to be educated with
53 children without disabilities in the least restrictive environment; and (2) prohibits the
54 removal of children with disabilities from a regular educational environment unless the
55 nature or severity of the child’s disability prevents the satisfactory education of the
56 child, even with the provision of supplementary aids and services. (20 U.S.C. §
57 1412(a)(5)) Section 4.5 provides that, when developing an individualized education
58 program for a pupil with a hearing impairment or a visual impairment, the
59 individualized education program team is required to adhere to such provisions of
60 federal law and include the basis for the placement of the pupil in the individualized
61 education program.
62 Existing law requires the Department to ensure compliance with the Individuals with
63 Disabilities Education Act, federal regulations adopted pursuant to the Act and Nevada
64 statutes and regulations governing the education of pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§
65 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300; NRS 388.417-388.5243) Existing law further authorizes a
66 person or governmental entity to request the Superintendent of Public Instruction to determine
67 whether a provider of special education is in compliance with such laws. (NRS 388.4352)
68 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill make conforming changes to require the provisions of [section 1]

Senate Amendment No. 425 to Senate Bill No. 174 Page 5
69 sections 1.3 and 1.7 be enforced in the same manner as other requirements governing pupils
70 with disabilities.
71 Existing law requires each volunteer at a public school, including a charter school, who is
72 likely to have unsupervised contact with pupils to submit his or her fingerprints to the
73 governing body of a charter school or the board of trustees of the school district, as applicable,
74 for the purposes of a criminal background check before beginning his or her service as a
75 volunteer and at least once every 5 years thereafter. (NRS 388A.515, 391.104) Under existing
76 law, a volunteer who meets certain requirements is not required to undergo such an
77 investigation. (NRS 388A.516, 391.105) Existing law defines the term “volunteer” to mean
78 any person who, without compensation, works at, assists with or oversees any activity or
79 event conducted or sponsored by the school during or outside of school hours. (NRS
80 388A.510, 391.1035) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill provide that the term “volunteer” also
81 includes private instructional personnel who provide services to a pupil with [autism spectrum
82 disorder] a disability who has an individualized education program [,] or a plan developed
83 pursuant to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, thereby
84 requiring such a volunteer to undergo an investigation into his or her background unless he or
85 she obtains certain exemptions.
86 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions in existing law
87 to [section 1.] sections 1.3 and 1.7.
