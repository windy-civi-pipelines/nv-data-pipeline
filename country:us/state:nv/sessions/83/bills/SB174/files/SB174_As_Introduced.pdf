AN ACT relating to education; requiring the board of trustees of
each school district and the governing body of each
charter school to develop a policy governing the provision
of certain services to pupils with autism spectrum
disorder; authorizing certain persons or governmental
entities to request the Superintendent of Public Instruction
to determine whether such policies comply with certain
laws and regulations; revising the definition of the term
“volunteer” as it relates to persons required to undergo

matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public schools to provide programs and services for
2 pupils with disabilities. (NRS 388.419, 388.429) Section 1 of this bill requires the
3 board of trustees of each school district and the governing body of each charter
4 school to develop a policy governing the manner in which pupils with autism
5 spectrum disorders who have individualized education programs receive medically
6 necessary treatment or services from private instructional personnel in a school
7 setting. Section 1 additionally requires such a policy to: (1) require each school to
8 provide notice to the parent or legal guardian of such a pupil of certain rights; (2)
9 set forth protocols for private educational personnel to observe such pupils,
10 collaborate with educational personnel and provide medically necessary treatment
11 and other services; and (3) comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education
12 Act. Furthermore, section 1: (1) prohibits a school district or charter school from
13 charging certain fees relating to the provision of certain services; (2) sets forth the
14 only requirements a school district or charter school is authorized to place on
-

– 2 –
15 private instructional personnel; (3) requires the policy developed by each school
16 district and charter school to be made available on its Internet website and to a
17 parent or legal guardian who requests a copy; and (4) requires each school district
18 and charter school to compile a report containing certain information and submit
19 such a report to the Department of Education, which must submit the reports to
20 certain legislative bodies.
21 Existing law requires the Department to ensure compliance with the Individuals
22 with Disabilities Education Act, federal regulations adopted pursuant to the Act and
23 Nevada statutes and regulations governing the education of pupils with disabilities.
24 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300; NRS 388.417-388.5243) Existing
25 law further authorizes a person or governmental entity to request the
26 Superintendent of Public Instruction to determine whether a provider of special
27 education is in compliance with such laws. (NRS 388.4352) Sections 3 and 4 of
28 this bill make conforming changes to require the provisions of section 1 be
29 enforced in the same manner as other requirements governing pupils with
30 disabilities.
31 Existing law requires each volunteer at a public school, including a charter
32 school, who is likely to have unsupervised contact with pupils to submit his or her
33 fingerprints to the governing body of a charter school or the board of trustees of the
34 school district, as applicable, for the purposes of a criminal background check
35 before beginning his or her service as a volunteer and at least once every 5 years
36 thereafter. (NRS 388A.515, 391.104) Under existing law, a volunteer who meets
37 certain requirements is not required to undergo such an investigation. (NRS
38 388A.516, 391.105) Existing law defines the term “volunteer” to mean any person
39 who, without compensation, works at, assists with or oversees any activity or event
40 conducted or sponsored by the school during or outside of school hours. (NRS
41 388A.510, 391.1035) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill provide that the term “volunteer”
42 also includes private instructional personnel who provide services to a pupil with
43 autism spectrum disorder who has an individualized education program, thereby
44 requiring such a volunteer to undergo an investigation into his or her background
45 unless he or she obtains certain exemptions.
46 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions in
47 existing law to section 1.
