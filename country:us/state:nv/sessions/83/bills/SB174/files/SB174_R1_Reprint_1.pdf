Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act governs how states and
2 public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to
3 pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.) Existing law requires public
-
*SB174_R1*

– 2 –
4 schools to provide programs and services for pupils with disabilities. (NRS
5 388.419, 388.429) Section 1.3 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each
6 school district and the governing body of each charter school to develop a policy
7 governing the manner in which pupils with disabilities who have individualized
8 education programs, or plans developed pursuant to section 504 of the
9 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, receive medically necessary treatment
10 or services from private instructional personnel in a school setting. Section 1.3
11 additionally requires such a policy to: (1) require each school to provide notice to
12 the parent or legal guardian of such a pupil of certain rights; (2) set forth protocols
13 for private educational personnel to observe such pupils, collaborate with
14 educational personnel and provide medically necessary treatment and other
15 services; and (3) comply with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
16 Furthermore, section 1.3: (1) prohibits a school district or charter school from
17 charging certain fees relating to the provision of certain services; (2) sets forth the
18 only requirements a school district or charter school is authorized to place on
19 private instructional personnel; (3) requires the policy developed by each school
20 district and charter school to be made available on its Internet website and to a
21 parent or legal guardian who requests a copy; and (4) requires each school district
22 and charter school to compile a report containing certain information and submit
23 such a report to the Department of Education, which must submit the reports to
24 certain legislative bodies. Finally, section 1.3 authorizes the board of trustees of a
25 school district or the governing body of a charter school to require the parent or
26 legal guardian of certain pupils with disabilities to sign a written acknowledgment
27 concerning any private instructional personnel and the provision of medically
28 necessary treatment.
29 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to prescribe minimum
30 standards for the special education of pupils with visual impairments, including,
31 without limitation, blindness. (NRS 388.419) Section 2.5 of this bill requires such
32 minimum standards to include: (1) standards for the provision of instruction in
33 Braille and the use of Braille; and (2) guidelines for providing for and integrating
34 assistive technology and assistive technology services into instruction.
35 Existing law additionally requires an individualized education program team
36 for a pupil with a hearing impairment or a pupil with a hearing or visual impairment
37 who is less than 6 years of age to take certain factors into consideration and include
38 certain provisions when developing an individualized education program for the
39 pupil. (NRS 388.437) Existing law also provides that a pupil is not required to take
40 advantage of the special provisions for the education of pupils with disabilities.
41 (NRS 388.431) Section 4.5 of this bill requires the individualized education
42 program team, when developing an individualized education program for a pupil
43 with a visual impairment, including, without limitation, blindness, or a hearing
44 impairment, including, without limitation, deafness, to: (1) if the parent or legal
45 guardian of the pupil requests that the pupil receive instruction in Braille and the
46 use of Braille, provide for such instruction; (2) provide that the pupil receive any
47 assistive technology and assistive technology services necessary to provide the
48 pupil with a free appropriate public education; and (3) prohibit an employee of a
49 school district or charter school from interfering with the ability of the pupil to
50 carry a cane or walking stick or use a mobility device while on school property.
51 Section 1.7 of this bill also provides that the ability of any pupil with such a
52 disability, including, without limitation, a pupil who elects not to take advantage of
53 the special provisions for the education of pupils with disabilities, may not have his
54 or her right to carry a cane or walking stick interfered with while on school
55 property.
56 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act: (1) requires, to the
57 maximum extent that is appropriate, children with disabilities to be educated with
58 children without disabilities in the least restrictive environment; and (2) prohibits
-
*SB174_R1*

– 3 –
59 the removal of children with disabilities from a regular educational environment
60 unless the nature or severity of the child’s disability prevents the satisfactory
61 education of the child, even with the provision of supplementary aids and services.
62 (20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)) Section 4.5 provides that, when developing an
63 individualized education program for a pupil with a hearing impairment or a visual
64 impairment, the individualized education program team is required to adhere to
65 such provisions of federal law and include the basis for the placement of the pupil
66 in the individualized education program.
67 Existing law requires the Department to ensure compliance with the Individuals
68 with Disabilities Education Act, federal regulations adopted pursuant to the Act and
69 Nevada statutes and regulations governing the education of pupils with disabilities.
70 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300; NRS 388.417-388.5243) Existing
71 law further authorizes a person or governmental entity to request the
72 Superintendent of Public Instruction to determine whether a provider of special
73 education is in compliance with such laws. (NRS 388.4352) Sections 3 and 4 of
74 this bill make conforming changes to require the provisions of sections 1.3 and 1.7
75 be enforced in the same manner as other requirements governing pupils with
76 disabilities.
77 Existing law requires each volunteer at a public school, including a charter
78 school, who is likely to have unsupervised contact with pupils to submit his or her
79 fingerprints to the governing body of a charter school or the board of trustees of the
80 school district, as applicable, for the purposes of a criminal background check
81 before beginning his or her service as a volunteer and at least once every 5 years
82 thereafter. (NRS 388A.515, 391.104) Under existing law, a volunteer who meets
83 certain requirements is not required to undergo such an investigation. (NRS
84 388A.516, 391.105) Existing law defines the term “volunteer” to mean any person
85 who, without compensation, works at, assists with or oversees any activity or event
86 conducted or sponsored by the school during or outside of school hours. (NRS
87 388A.510, 391.1035) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill provide that the term “volunteer”
88 also includes private instructional personnel who provide services to a pupil with a
89 disability who has an individualized education program or a plan developed
90 pursuant to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, thereby
91 requiring such a volunteer to undergo an investigation into his or her background
92 unless he or she obtains certain exemptions.
93 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions in
94 existing law to sections 1.3 and 1.7.
