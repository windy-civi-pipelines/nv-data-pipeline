4 California and local governments and owners of private property in both states. In
5 1999, the Nevada Legislature authorized the issuance of not more than $56.4
6 million in general obligation bonds to pay for a significant portion of Nevada’s
7 share of the costs of the first phase of the Program. (Chapter 514, Statutes of

10 million in general obligation bonds to pay for Nevada’s share of the costs of the
11 second phase of the Program beginning on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30,
12 2020. (Section 3 of chapter 431, Statutes of Nevada 2009, at page 2417) Issuance of
13 those bonds requires the approval of the Legislature or the Interim Finance
