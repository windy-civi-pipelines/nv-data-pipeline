CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the Lake Tahoe Basin; requiring the issuance of
general obligation bonds to carry out certain environmental
improvement projects included in the second phase of the
Environmental Improvement Program for the Lake Tahoe
Basin; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Environmental Improvement Program was implemented in 1997 to carry
out projects to improve the environment in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The costs of the
Program are apportioned among the Federal Government, the States of Nevada and
California and local governments and owners of private property in both states. In
1999, the Nevada Legislature authorized the issuance of not more than $56.4
million in general obligation bonds to pay for a significant portion of Nevada’s
share of the costs of the first phase of the Program. (Chapter 514, Statutes of
Nevada 1999, at page 2626)
In 2009, the Nevada Legislature authorized the issuance of not more than $100
million in general obligation bonds to pay for Nevada’s share of the costs of the
second phase of the Program beginning on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30,

Section 2:
2020. (Section 3 of chapter 431, Statutes of Nevada 2009, at page 2417) Issuance of
those bonds requires the approval of the Legislature or the Interim Finance
Committee. (Id.) In 2017, the Nevada Legislature extended the deadline for the
issuance of the remainder of the general obligation bonds that were authorized in
2009 for the second phase of the Program from June 30, 2020, to June 30, 2030.
(Chapter 32, Statutes of Nevada 2017, at page 137)
Of the $100 million in general obligation bonds authorized to pay for Nevada’s
share of the costs of the second phase of the Program, the Nevada Legislature
required the issuance of: (1) not more than $4.42 million of those bonds in 2009;
(2) not more than $12 million of those bonds in 2011; (3) not more than $8 million
of those bonds in 2019; (4) not more than $4 million of those bonds in 2021; and
(5) not more than $13 million of those bonds in 2023. (Section 1 of chapter 431,
Statutes of Nevada 2009, at page 2416; section 1 of chapter 437, Statutes of Nevada
2011, at page 2638; section 1 of chapter 167, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 891;

Section 3:
section 1 of chapter 215, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 1008; section 1 of
chapter 99, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 501)
This bill requires the issuance of not more than $10.5 million of the $100
million in general obligation bonds authorized in 2009 to provide money to carry
out certain environmental improvement projects included in the second phase of the
Environmental Improvement Program and allows the use of interest accrued on the
proceeds of the general obligation bonds for the Program.
