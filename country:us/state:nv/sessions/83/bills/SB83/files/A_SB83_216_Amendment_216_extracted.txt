AN ACT relating to the Lake Tahoe Basin; requiring the issuance of general
obligation bonds to carry out certain environmental improvement
projects included in the second phase of the Environmental

1 The Environmental Improvement Program was implemented in 1997 to carry out projects
2 to improve the environment in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The costs of the Program are
3 apportioned among the Federal Government, the States of Nevada and California and local
4 governments and owners of private property in both states. In 1999, the Nevada Legislature
5 authorized the issuance of not more than $56.4 million in general obligation bonds to pay for a
6 significant portion of Nevada’s share of the costs of the first phase of the Program. (Chapter
7 514, Statutes of Nevada 1999, at page 2626)
8 In 2009, the Nevada Legislature authorized the issuance of not more than $100 million in
9 general obligation bonds to pay for Nevada’s share of the costs of the second phase of the
10 Program beginning on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30, 2020. (Section 3 of chapter 431,
11 Statutes of Nevada 2009, at page 2417) Issuance of those bonds requires the approval of the
12 Legislature or the Interim Finance Committee. (Id.) In 2017, the Nevada Legislature extended

14 authorized in 2009 for the second phase of the Program from June 30, 2020, to June 30, 2030.
