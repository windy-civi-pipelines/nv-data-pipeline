Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the operation of brew pubs, estate distilleries and
2 wineries in this State. Existing law authorizes an estate distillery, under certain
3 circumstances, to receive malt beverages or wine in bulk from a wholesale dealer,
4 brew pub or winery for the purpose of distillation and blending. Existing law
5 authorizes a brew pub or winery to make such a transfer in bulk directly to an estate
6 distillery, under certain circumstances, if no licensed wholesale dealer is able or
7 willing to make the transfer. (NRS 597.230, 597.237, 597.240) Section 1 of this bill
8 similarly authorizes an estate distillery to receive neutral or distilled spirits in bulk
9 from a supplier that is not an affiliate of the estate distillery for the purpose of
10 storage and bottling. Section 1 requires an estate distillery to segregate such spirits
11 in a conspicuous place away from any other spirits or alcoholic beverages on the
12 premises.
13 Existing law authorizes an estate distillery to sell at retail the spirits
14 manufactured at the estate distillery. (NRS 597.237) Section 1 authorizes an estate
15 distillery to also sell other alcoholic beverages at retail, if the estate distillery has
16 obtained any license or permit required in the jurisdiction in which the estate
17 distillery is located and the estate distillery complies with the requirements of
18 existing law to purchase liquor from certain wholesalers or importers.
