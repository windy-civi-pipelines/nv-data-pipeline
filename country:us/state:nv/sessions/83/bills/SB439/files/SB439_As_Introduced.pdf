AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; authorizing an estate
distillery to sell at retail alcoholic beverages not
manufactured at the estate distillery; authorizing an estate
distillery to receive, store and bottle certain spirits;
providing that certain provisions shall not be construed as
prohibiting certain conduct of suppliers; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the operation of brew pubs, estate distilleries and
2 wineries in this State. Existing law authorizes an estate distillery, under certain
3 circumstances, to receive malt beverages or wine in bulk from a wholesale dealer,
4 brew pub or winery for the purpose of distillation and blending. Existing law
5 authorizes a brew pub or winery to make such a transfer in bulk directly to an estate
6 distillery, under certain circumstances, if no licensed wholesale dealer is able or
7 willing to make the transfer. (NRS 597.230, 597.237, 597.240) Section 1 of this bill
8 similarly authorizes an estate distillery to receive neutral or distilled spirits in bulk
9 from a supplier for the purpose of storage and bottling. Section 1 requires an estate
10 distillery to segregate such spirits in a conspicuous place away from any other
11 spirits or alcoholic beverages on the premises.
12 Existing law authorizes an estate distillery to sell at retail the spirits
13 manufactured at the estate distillery. (NRS 597.237) Section 1 authorizes an estate
14 distillery to also sell other alcoholic beverages at retail, if the estate distillery has
15 obtained any license or permit required in the jurisdiction in which the estate
16 distillery is located and the estate distillery complies with the requirements of
17 existing law to purchase liquor from a state-licensed wholesaler.
18 Existing law prohibits a wholesaler from engaging in certain conduct. (NRS
19 369.485) Section 2 of this bill provides that such prohibitions must not be
20 construed to apply to a supplier that engages in conduct which is otherwise
21 authorized by law.
