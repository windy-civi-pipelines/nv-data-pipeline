3 malt beverages or wine in bulk from a wholesale dealer, brew pub or winery for the purpose
4 of distillation and blending. Existing law authorizes a brew pub or winery to make such a
5 transfer in bulk directly to an estate distillery, under certain circumstances, if no licensed
6 wholesale dealer is able or willing to make the transfer. (NRS 597.230, 597.237, 597.240)
7 Section 1 of this bill similarly authorizes an estate distillery to receive neutral or distilled
8 spirits in bulk from a supplier that is not an affiliate of the estate distillery for the purpose
9 of storage and bottling. Section 1 requires an estate distillery to segregate such spirits in a
10 conspicuous place away from any other spirits or alcoholic beverages on the premises.
11 Existing law authorizes an estate distillery to sell at retail the spirits manufactured at the
12 estate distillery. (NRS 597.237) Section 1 authorizes an estate distillery to also sell other
13 alcoholic beverages at retail, if the estate distillery has obtained any license or permit required
14 in the jurisdiction in which the estate distillery is located and the estate distillery complies
15 with the requirements of existing law to purchase liquor from [a state-licensed wholesaler.
16 Existing law prohibits a wholesaler from engaging in certain conduct. (NRS 369.485)
17 Section 2 of this bill provides that such prohibitions must not be construed to apply to a
18 supplier that engages in conduct which is otherwise authorized by law.] certain wholesalers
19 or importers.
