Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; authorizing an estate
distillery to sell at retail alcoholic beverages not
manufactured at the estate distillery; authorizing an estate
distillery to receive, store and bottle certain spirits; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the operation of brew pubs, estate distilleries and
wineries in this State. Existing law authorizes an estate distillery, under certain
circumstances, to receive malt beverages or wine in bulk from a wholesale dealer,
brew pub or winery for the purpose of distillation and blending. Existing law
authorizes a brew pub or winery to make such a transfer in bulk directly to an estate
distillery, under certain circumstances, if no licensed wholesale dealer is able or
willing to make the transfer. (NRS 597.230, 597.237, 597.240) Section 1 of this bill
similarly authorizes an estate distillery to receive neutral or distilled spirits in bulk
from a supplier that is not an affiliate of the estate distillery for the purpose of
storage and bottling. Section 1 requires an estate distillery to segregate such spirits
in a conspicuous place away from any other spirits or alcoholic beverages on the
premises.
Existing law authorizes an estate distillery to sell at retail the spirits
manufactured at the estate distillery. (NRS 597.237) Section 1 authorizes an estate
distillery to also sell other alcoholic beverages at retail, if the estate distillery has
obtained any license or permit required in the jurisdiction in which the estate
distillery is located and the estate distillery complies with the requirements of
existing law to purchase liquor from certain wholesalers or importers.
