SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION—Declaring April 2025
as Financial Literacy Month.
WHEREAS, The Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 314 (2019),
which helps make financial literacy in the classroom a reality for
Nevada’s school-age children and established the State Financial
Literacy Advisory Council; and
WHEREAS, The duties of the State Financial Literacy Advisory
Council include requirements for the Advisory Council to develop a
strategic plan for the development of educational resources in
financial literacy and identify learning activities targeted toward the
standards and criteria of a curriculum in financial literacy; and
WHEREAS, The Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 274
(2023), which revised provisions relating to the instruction of
financial literacy in this State to help students navigate personal
finances; and
WHEREAS, A lack of financial literacy has real consequences for
individuals, including lower savings rates, poor credit and less
wealth overall; and
WHEREAS, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development conducted a survey in 2022 of individuals who are 15
years of age in the United States and found that 17 percent of
respondents did not learn or are unable to apply fundamental
financial skills that often occur in everyday situations, such as
building a simple budget, comparison shopping and understanding
an invoice; and
WHEREAS, According to an Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development study conducted in 2022, more than one
in six students in the United States did not reach the baseline level
of proficiency in financial literacy; and

WHEREAS, In 2018, an EVERFI survey of over 100,000
incoming college students found that 92 percent of students felt they
needed more education, information or support to be able to pay off
their college loans; and
WHEREAS, According to a survey conducted by Experian in
2019, 49 percent of Generation Z consumers surveyed said that they
found financial topics to be somewhat interesting or interesting, and
11 percent said they loved learning about such topics; and
WHEREAS, The International Review of Economics Education
published a paper in 2014 titled “The features and effectiveness of
the Keys to Financial Success curriculum,” which found that one-
semester financial literacy programs taught by trained teachers were
found to increase the financial knowledge of high school students by
61 percent and were most effective in improving knowledge in the
areas that the students were most deficient; and
WHEREAS, A study from Montana State University found that
high school financial education leads to better financial aid
decisions once students reach college, increases subsidized
borrowing at advantageous federal rates and decreases use of more
costly forms of borrowing, including credit cards and private loans;
and
WHEREAS, Financial literacy rates directly affect the financial
health of individuals, families, communities and the country; and
WHEREAS, Resolutions similar to this resolution have been
introduced and passed with strong bipartisan support to increase
awareness of the need for financial literacy for Nevada citizens;
now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, THE
ASSEMBLY CONCURRING, That the Nevada Legislature hereby
recognizes and declares the month of April 2025 as Financial
Literacy Month, in order to raise public awareness about the need
for increased financial capability; and be it further
RESOLVED, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and
transmit a copy of this resolution to the Governor of the State of
Nevada, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the
Assembly, the Minority Leader of the Senate, the Minority Leader
of the Assembly, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the
Nevada Credit Union League and the Nevada Bankers Association;
and be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.
