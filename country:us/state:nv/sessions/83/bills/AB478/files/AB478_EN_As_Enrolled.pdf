Assembly Bill No. 478–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to construction; setting forth certain limitations on
a board of county commissioners or the governing body of a
city in adopting an ordinance restricting the hours in which
construction work may begin during certain times of the year;
revising certain prohibitions on a declarant-controlled
common-interest community from restricting the hours that
construction work may begin during certain times of the year;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that if the board of county commissioners in a county
whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) or the
governing body of a city which is located in such a county (currently the cities of
Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite and North Las Vegas) adopts an
ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin in a
common-interest community, the hours for construction work in a declarant-
controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but not earlier
than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
(NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections 3.3 and 3.5 of this bill provide that, regardless
of the population of the county, if a board or governing body adopts an ordinance
restricting the hours in which construction work may begin, the hours for
construction work on any project that is more than 300 feet from an occupied
residential unit must be allowed to begin by 5 a.m. during the period beginning on
April 1 and ending on September 30.
Existing law provides that if, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
(currently only Clark County), the governing body of the county or city adopts an
ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin, a declarant-
controlled common-interest community must not restrict the hours that construction
work may begin in the declarant-controlled common-interest community during the
period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30 to hours other than those
set forth in the ordinance. (NRS 116.347) Section 3.6 of this bill applies such
authorization to the governing body of a county or city regardless of the population
of the county.
Section 3.7 of this bill provides that if, on the effective date of this bill, the
board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city has adopted an
ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin and the
ordinance does not allow construction work more than 300 feet from an occupied
residential unit to begin by 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and
ending on September 30, the ordinance is void and unenforceable. Section 3.7
further provides that any provision in a governing document of an executive board
of a common-interest community or a plan for the development of a planned
development which is more restrictive than the provisions of this bill is void and
unenforceable.
