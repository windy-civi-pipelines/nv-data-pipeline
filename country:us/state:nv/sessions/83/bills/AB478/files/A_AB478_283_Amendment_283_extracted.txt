3 which is located in such a county (currently the cities of Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas,
4 Mesquite and North Las Vegas) adopts an ordinance restricting the hours in which
5 construction work may begin in a common-interest community, the hours for construction
6 work in a declarant-controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but
7 not earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
8 (NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections [1 and 3] 3.3 and 3.5 of this bill provide [instead] that if
9 such a board or governing body adopts an ordinance restricting the hours in which

11 any project that is more than 300 feet from a residential unit must be allowed to begin at,
12 but not earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September

14 [Existing law provides that if, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
15 only Clark County), the governing body of a county or city adopts an ordinance restricting the
16 hours in which construction work may begin, a declarant-controlled common-interest
17 community must not restrict the hours that construction work may begin in the declarant-
18 controlled common-interest community during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on
19 September 30 to hours other than those set forth in the ordinance. (NRS 116.347) Section 2 of
20 this bill instead provides that these prohibitions apply to any common-interest community.]
21 Section 3.7 of this bill provides that if, on the effective date of this bill, the board of
22 county commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more or the governing
23 body of a city located in such a county has adopted an ordinance restricting the hours in
24 which construction work may begin and the ordinance does not allow construction work
