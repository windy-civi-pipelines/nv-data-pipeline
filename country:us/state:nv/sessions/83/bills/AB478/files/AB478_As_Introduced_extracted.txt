FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to construction; revising provisions relating to the
times during which residential construction work may
start in certain counties and cities; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if the board of county commissioners in a county
2 whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) or the
3 governing body of a city which is located in such a county (currently the cities of
4 Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite and North Las Vegas) adopts an
5 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin in a
6 common-interest community, the hours for construction work in a declarant-
7 controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but not earlier
8 than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
9 (NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill provide instead that if such
10 a board or governing body adopts an ordinance restricting the hours in which
11 residential construction work may begin, the hours for residential construction work
12 must be allowed to begin at, but not earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning
13 on April 1 and ending on September 30.
14 Existing law provides that if, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
15 (currently only Clark County), the governing body of a county or city adopts an
16 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin, a declarant-
17 controlled common-interest community must not restrict the hours that construction
18 work may begin in the declarant-controlled common-interest community during the
19 period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30 to hours other than those
20 set forth in the ordinance. (NRS 116.347) Section 2 of this bill instead provides that
21 these prohibitions apply to any common-interest community.
