AN ACT relating to construction; setting forth certain limitations on a board of
county commissioners [in certain counties] or the governing body of a
city [in such a county] in adopting an ordinance restricting the hours in
which construction work may begin during certain times of the year;
revising certain prohibitions on a declarant-controlled common-
interest community from restricting the hours that construction
work may begin during certain times of the year; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if the board of county commissioners in a county whose
2 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) or the governing body of a city
3 which is located in such a county (currently the cities of Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas,
4 Mesquite and North Las Vegas) adopts an ordinance restricting the hours in which
5 construction work may begin in a common-interest community, the hours for construction
6 work in a declarant-controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but
7 not earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
8 (NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections 3.3 and 3.5 of this bill provide that , regardless of the
9 population of the county, if [such] a board or governing body adopts an ordinance restricting
10 the hours in which construction work may begin, the hours for construction work on any
11 project that is more than 300 feet from [a] an occupied residential unit must be allowed to
12 begin [at, but not earlier than,] by 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on
13 September 30.
14 Existing law provides that if, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
15 (currently only Clark County), the governing body of the county or city adopts an
16 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin, a declarant-
17 controlled common-interest community must not restrict the hours that construction
18 work may begin in the declarant-controlled common-interest community during the
19 period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30 to hours other than those set
20 forth in the ordinance. (NRS 116.347) Section 3.6 of this bill applies such authorization
21 to the governing body of a county or city regardless of the population of the county.
22 Section 3.7 of this bill provides that if, on the effective date of this bill, the board of
23 county commissioners [in a county whose population is 700,000 or more] or the governing
24 body of a city [located in such a county] has adopted an ordinance restricting the hours in

Senate Amendment No. 605 to Assembly Bill No. 478 First Reprint Page 4
25 which construction work may begin and the ordinance does not allow construction work more
26 than 300 feet from [a] an occupied residential unit to begin [at, but not earlier than,] by 5 a.m.
27 during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30, the ordinance is void and
28 unenforceable. Section 3.7 further provides that any provision in a governing document
29 of an executive board of a common-interest community or a plan for the development of
30 a planned development which is more restrictive than an ordinance adopted in
31 accordance with the provisions of this bill is void and unenforceable.
