AN ACT relating to construction; setting forth certain limitations on
a board of county commissioners or the governing body
of a city in adopting an ordinance restricting the hours in
which construction work may begin during certain times
of the year; revising certain prohibitions on a declarant-
controlled common-interest community from restricting
the hours that construction work may begin during certain
times of the year; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if the board of county commissioners in a county
2 whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) or the
3 governing body of a city which is located in such a county (currently the cities of
4 Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite and North Las Vegas) adopts an
5 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin in a
6 common-interest community, the hours for construction work in a declarant-
7 controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but not earlier
8 than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
9 (NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections 3.3 and 3.5 of this bill provide that, regardless
10 of the population of the county, if a board or governing body adopts an ordinance
11 restricting the hours in which construction work may begin, the hours for
12 construction work on any project that is more than 300 feet from an occupied
13 residential unit must be allowed to begin by 5 a.m. during the period beginning on
14 April 1 and ending on September 30.
15 Existing law provides that if, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
16 (currently only Clark County), the governing body of the county or city adopts an
17 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin, a declarant-
18 controlled common-interest community must not restrict the hours that construction

19 work may begin in the declarant-controlled common-interest community during the
20 period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30 to hours other than those
21 set forth in the ordinance. (NRS 116.347) Section 3.6 of this bill applies such
22 authorization to the governing body of a county or city regardless of the population
23 of the county.
24 Section 3.7 of this bill provides that if, on the effective date of this bill, the
25 board of county commissioners or the governing body of a city has adopted an
26 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin and the
27 ordinance does not allow construction work more than 300 feet from an occupied
28 residential unit to begin by 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and
29 ending on September 30, the ordinance is void and unenforceable. Section 3.7
30 further provides that any provision in a governing document of an executive board
31 of a common-interest community or a plan for the development of a planned
32 development which is more restrictive than an ordinance adopted in accordance
33 with the provisions of this bill is void and unenforceable.
