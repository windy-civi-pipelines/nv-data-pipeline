SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing construction times in counties and
cities. (BDR 20-1091)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to construction; setting forth certain limitations on a board of
county commissioners or the governing body of a city in adopting an
ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin
during certain times of the year; revising certain prohibitions on a
declarant-controlled common-interest community from restricting the
hours that construction work may begin during certain times of the
year; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if the board of county commissioners in a county whose
2 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) or the governing body of a city
3 which is located in such a county (currently the cities of Boulder City, Henderson, Las Vegas,
4 Mesquite and North Las Vegas) adopts an ordinance restricting the hours in which
5 construction work may begin in a common-interest community, the hours for construction
6 work in a declarant-controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but
7 not earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
8 (NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections 3.3 and 3.5 of this bill provide that, regardless of the
9 population of the county, if a board or governing body adopts an ordinance restricting the
10 hours in which construction work may begin, the hours for construction work on any project
11 that is more than 300 feet from an occupied residential unit must be allowed to begin by 5
12 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
13 Existing law provides that if, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
14 only Clark County), the governing body of the county or city adopts an ordinance restricting
15 the hours in which construction work may begin, a declarant-controlled common-interest
16 community must not restrict the hours that construction work may begin in the declarant-
17 controlled common-interest community during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on
18 September 30 to hours other than those set forth in the ordinance. (NRS 116.347) Section 3.6
19 of this bill applies such authorization to the governing body of a county or city regardless of
20 the population of the county.
21 Section 3.7 of this bill provides that if, on the effective date of this bill, the board of
22 county commissioners or the governing body of a city has adopted an ordinance restricting the
23 hours in which construction work may begin and the ordinance does not allow construction
24 work more than 300 feet from an occupied residential unit to begin by 5 a.m. during the
25 period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30, the ordinance is void and
Senate Amendment No. 736 to Assembly Bill No. 478 Second Reprint Page 4
26 unenforceable. Section 3.7 further provides that any provision in a governing document of an
27 executive board of a common-interest community or a plan for the development of a planned
28 development which is more restrictive than [an ordinance adopted in accordance with] the
29 provisions of this bill is void and unenforceable.
