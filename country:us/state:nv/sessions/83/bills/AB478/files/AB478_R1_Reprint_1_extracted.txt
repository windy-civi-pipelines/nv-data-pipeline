5 ordinance restricting the hours in which construction work may begin in a
6 common-interest community, the hours for construction work in a declarant-
7 controlled common-interest community must be allowed to begin at, but not earlier
8 than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on September 30.
9 (NRS 244.3679, 268.4137) Sections 3.3 and 3.5 of this bill provide that if such a
10 board or governing body adopts an ordinance restricting the hours in which
11 construction work may begin, the hours for construction work on any project that is
12 more than 300 feet from a residential unit must be allowed to begin at, but not
13 earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on
14 September 30.
15 Section 3.7 of this bill provides that if, on the effective date of this bill, the
16 board of county commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more or
17 the governing body of a city located in such a county has adopted an ordinance
18 restricting the hours in which construction work may begin and the ordinance does
19 not allow construction work more than 300 feet from a residential unit to begin at,
20 but not earlier than, 5 a.m. during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on
21 September 30, the ordinance is void and unenforceable.
