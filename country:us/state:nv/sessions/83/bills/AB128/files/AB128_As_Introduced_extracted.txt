Records Ombudsman in the Executive Department of
State Government; setting forth the powers and duties of
the Ombudsman; authorizing a person to file a complaint

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential,
2 all public books and records of a state or local governmental entity are required to
3 be open at all times during office hours for the public to inspect, copy or receive a
4 copy thereof. Existing law also authorizes a person to request a copy of a public
5 book or record in any medium in which the book or record is available. (NRS
6 239.010) Section 2 of this bill creates the Office of Public Records Ombudsman as
7 an independent agency in the Executive Department of State Government and
8 requires the Governor to appoint a person as the Public Records Ombudsman.
9 Section 5 of this bill defines the term “Ombudsman.”
10 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the duties of the Ombudsman, which include
11 establishing a mediation program for complaints relating to public books and
12 records, investigating complaints relating to public books and records, and
13 providing training, education and educational material relating to public books
14 and records.
15 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person to file a complaint with the
16 Ombudsman. Upon receiving a complaint, section 4 requires the Ombudsman to

17 notify the governmental entity of the complaint and offer the parties the opportunity
18 to resolve the complaint through mediation. If a party refuses mediation or the
19 mediation is unsuccessful, section 4 authorizes the Ombudsman to initiate an
20 investigation into the complaint and issue a final determination not later than 90
21 days after initiating the investigation and, if warranted, provide relief in the form
22 of: (1) denying the request for the release of the public book or record; (2) requiring
23 the governmental entity to permit the requester to inspect or copy the public book
24 or record; or (3) waiving or reducing the fee charged by the governmental entity for
25 providing a copy of the public book or record to the requester.
26 If a request for inspection, copying or copies of a public book or record is
27 denied or unreasonably delayed, or if the person making the request believes that
28 the fee charged by the governmental entity is excessive or improper, existing law
29 authorizes a requester to apply to a district court for an order permitting the
30 requester to make or receive a copy of the book or record or providing relief
31 relating to the amount of the fee. (NRS 239.011) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill
32 authorize a requester or governmental entity that is aggrieved by the final
33 determination of the Ombudsman to seek judicial relief.
