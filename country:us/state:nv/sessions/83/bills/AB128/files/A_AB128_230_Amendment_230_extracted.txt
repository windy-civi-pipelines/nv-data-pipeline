6 Records Ombudsman as an independent agency in the Executive Department of State
7 Government and requires the Governor to appoint a person as the Public Records
8 Ombudsman. Section 5 of this bill defines the term “Ombudsman.”
9 Section 3 of this bill sets forth the duties of the Ombudsman, which include establishing a
10 mediation program for complaints relating to public books and records, investigating

13 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person to file a complaint with the Ombudsman. Upon
14 receiving a complaint, section 4 requires the Ombudsman to notify the governmental entity of
15 the complaint and offer the parties the opportunity to resolve the complaint through mediation.
16 If a party refuses mediation or the mediation is unsuccessful, section 4 authorizes the

25 governmental entity is excessive or improper, existing law authorizes a requester to apply to a
26 district court for an order permitting the requester to make or receive a copy of the book or
27 record or providing relief relating to the amount of the fee. (NRS 239.011) Sections 4 and 6 of
28 this bill authorize a requester or governmental entity that is aggrieved by the final
29 determination of the Ombudsman to seek judicial relief.] This bill creates the Public
30 Records Task Force to evaluate certain topics relating to requests for public records and
31 make certain recommendations. This bill also: (1) prescribes the membership and duties
