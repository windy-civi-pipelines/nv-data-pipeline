~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; transferring regulation of
nonemergency medical transportation from the Nevada
Transportation Authority to certain health authorities;
exempting certain operators of a vehicle for
nonemergency medical transportation from the
requirement to be permitted; requiring the driver of a
vehicle for nonemergency medical transportation to report
the abuse, neglect, isolation, abandonment or commercial
sexual exploitation of certain persons; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Transportation Authority to supervise and
2 regulate common motor carriers of passengers and contract motor carriers of
3 passengers, including private providers of nonmedical emergency transportation,
4 while exempting government vehicles from such regulation. (NRS 706.163,
5 706.166) Existing law requires a private provider of nonemergency medical
6 transportation to obtain from the Authority a certificate of public convenience and
7 necessity to operate as a common motor carrier or a permit to act as a contract
8 motor carrier. (NRS 706.036, 706.051, 706.386, 706.421)
9 Existing law also requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
10 Department of Health and Human Services, in a county whose population is less
11 than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County), or the district board
12 of health, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark
13 County), to issue permits for the operation of an ambulance, an air ambulance or a
-

– 2 –
14 vehicle of a fire-fighting agency. (NRS 450B.100, 450B.200) Existing law also
15 requires the State Board of Health, in a county whose population is less than
16 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County), or the district board of
17 health, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County),
18 to adopt regulations establishing minimum standards for vehicles for ambulances,
19 air ambulances and vehicles of a fire-fighting agency. (NRS 450B.130)
20 This bill transfers regulatory authority over providers of nonemergency medical
21 transportation from the Nevada Transportation Authority to: (1) the district board of
22 health in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County);
23 or (2) the Division in all other counties. Section 24 of this bill removes the
24 requirement that a private operator of a vehicle for nonemergency medical
25 transportation obtain a certificate or permit from the Nevada Transportation
26 Authority, and section 16 of this bill instead requires a private operator of such a
27 vehicle to obtain a permit from the district board of health or the Division, as
28 applicable. Sections 8 and 12 of this bill accordingly authorize the operator of such
29 a vehicle to obtain such a permit. Section 12 additionally limits the fee for such a
30 permit to not more than $200. Section 13 of this bill clarifies the scope of a
31 provisional permit to own or operate a vehicle for nonemergency medical
32 transportation services. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill authorize: (1) the district
33 board of health to regulate nonemergency medical transportation in a county whose
34 population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County); and (2) the State Board of
35 Health to regulate nonemergency medical transportation in all other counties.
36 Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that the district health
37 department in a county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all
38 counties other than Clark County) will not be regulating nonemergency medical
39 transportation. Section 14 of this bill prohibits a private owner of a vehicle for
40 nonemergency medical transportation to permit the operation of the vehicle in
41 violation of the standards prescribed by the applicable board. Section 15 of this bill
42 requires a provider of nonemergency medical transportation to file his or her
43 schedule of rates with the Division or district board of health, as applicable.
44 Sections 12 and 17 of this bill clarify that the issuance of a permit does not exempt
45 a provider of nonemergency medical transportation from local franchising and
46 permitting requirements. Section 5 of this bill defines the term “nonemergency
47 medical transportation,” and section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability of
48 that definition. Section 18 of this bill preserves the existing exemption for
49 governmental entities that provide nonemergency medical transportation from
50 permitting and regulation. Sections 19 and 20 of this bill require the driver of a
51 vehicle for nonemergency medical transportation to report the abuse, neglect,
52 isolation or abandonment of an elderly or vulnerable person or the abuse or neglect
53 of a child. Such a driver would also be required to report the commercial sexual
54 exploitation of a child. (NRS 432C.110) A willful failure to make such a report
55 would be a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, depending on the circumstances.
56 (NRS 200.5093, 432B.240, 432C.110)
57 Existing law exempts from certification by the Nevada Transportation
58 Authority a common motor carrier that enters into an agreement with certain local
59 governmental entities to provide nonemergency medical transportation to facilitate
60 the participation of certain persons in jobs and day training services under certain
61 conditions. (NRS 706.745) Section 6 of this bill preserves that exemption from
62 permitting under the same conditions. Sections 2, 3, 20 and 21 of this bill make
63 conforming changes to reflect that nonemergency medical transportation will now
64 be regulated by the Division and the State Board of Health or the district board of
65 health rather than the Nevada Transportation Authority. Sections 11 and 23 of this
66 bill make conforming changes to avoid granting new authority to providers of
67 nonemergency medical transportation.
