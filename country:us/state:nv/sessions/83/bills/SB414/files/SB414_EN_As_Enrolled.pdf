Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Nevada Financial Disclosure Act requires certain public officers and
candidates for public office to disclose certain information in financial disclosure
statements filed with the Secretary of State. (NRS 281.005, 281.5555-281.581)
Section 1.4 of this bill requires a state employee to file a financial disclosure
statement with the Secretary of State if the state employee: (1) is appointed to a
position of employment by a constitutional officer; (2) is in neither the classified or
unclassified service of this State; (3) serves at the pleasure of the constitutional
officer; and (4) is not otherwise a public officer. Section 1.9 of this bill applies
certain existing civil penalties to such a state employee who willfully fails to file a
financial disclosure statement or willfully fails to file a financial disclosure
statement in a timely manner.
Section 1.7 of this bill provides that, for a state employee who serves more than
1 year in the same position of employment or more than one position of
employment for which a financial disclosure statement is required, the date of filing
of the last financial statement is the date which begins the period in which such
statements must be retained by the Secretary of State.
Section 1.8 of this bill requires each constitutional officer who appoints a state
employee who is required to file a financial disclosure statement to submit to the
Secretary of State a list of each such state employee appointed by the constitutional
officer. Sections 1-1.35, 1.5 and 13 of this bill make additional conforming
changes to incorporate such public employees into the existing provisions of the
Act.
The Act requires the disclosure of: (1) the specific location and use of certain
real estate, other than a personal residence, located in this State or an adjacent state
in which the public officer, candidate or member of the public officer’s or
candidate’s household has a legal or beneficial interest and whose fair market value
is $2,500 or more; and (2) each business entity with which the public officer or
candidate or member of the public officer’s or candidate’s household is involved as
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
a holder of a class of stock or security representing 1 percent or more of the total
outstanding stock or securities issued by the business entity. (NRS 281.571)
Section 1.5 of this bill removes the requirement that only real estate located in this
State or an adjacent State be disclosed. Section 1.5 additionally requires the
disclosure of each: (1) business entity with which the public officer, state employee
or candidate or a member of the public officer’s, state employee’s or candidate’s
household is involved as a holder of a class of stock or security issued by the
business entity that is valued at $5,000 or more; and (2) investment security, with
certain exceptions, held by the public officer, state employee or candidate that is
valued at more than $5,000.
Existing law requires certain persons who make independent expenditures and
certain committees for political action, political parties and committees sponsored
by a political party which receive certain contributions or make certain
expenditures to report such contributions and expenditures. (NRS 294A.140,
294A.150, 294A.210, 294A.220, 294A.230) Section 5 of this bill requires an
inaugural committee to report certain contributions and expenditures. Section 4 of
this bill defines the term “inaugural committee.”
Existing law requires a candidate for office at a primary election or general
election to report certain contributions made during the election year. (NRS
294A.120) Section 6 of this bill requires a candidate who has been elected to a
constitutional office to report certain contributions and expenditures in relation to
the transition to the constitutional office. Section 3 of this bill defines the terms
“constitutional office” and “constitutional officer.”
Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the terms defined in
sections 3 and 4 to certain provisions of law governing campaign practices.
Section 8 of this bill prohibits a foreign national from making a contribution or
a commitment to make a contribution to an inaugural committee.
Sections 9-12 of this bill make conforming changes to incorporate the
requirements of sections 5 and 6 into existing law governing campaign practices.
