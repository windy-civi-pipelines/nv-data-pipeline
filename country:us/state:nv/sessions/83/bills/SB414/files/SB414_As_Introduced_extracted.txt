3 statements filed with the Secretary of State. (NRS 281.005, 281.5555-281.581) In
4 part, existing law requires the disclosure of each business entity with which the
5 public officer or candidate or member of the public officer’s or candidate’s
6 household is involved as a holder of a class of stock or security representing 1
7 percent or more of the total outstanding stock or securities issued by the business

16 294A.150, 294A.210, 294A.220, 294A.230) Section 5 of this bill requires an
17 inaugural committee to report certain contributions and expenditures. Section 4 of

22 constitutional office to report certain contributions and expenditures in relation to

7 percent or more of the total outstanding stock or securities issued by the business

22 5. A violation of any provision of this section is a gross
23 misdemeanor.

26 cumulative, do not abrogate and are in addition to any other
27 remedies and penalties that may exist at law or in equity, including,
28 without limitation, any criminal penalty that may be imposed
29 pursuant to this chapter or NRS 199.120, 199.145 or 239.330.
