8 officer; and (4) is not otherwise a public officer. Section 1.9 of this bill applies
9 certain existing civil penalties to such a state employee who willfully fails to file a
10 financial disclosure statement or willfully fails to file a financial disclosure
11 statement in a timely manner.
12 Section 1.7 of this bill provides that, for a state employee who serves more than
13 1 year in the same position of employment or more than one position of
14 employment for which a financial disclosure statement is required, the date of filing
15 of the last financial statement is the date which begins the period in which such
16 statements must be retained by the Secretary of State.
17 Section 1.8 of this bill requires each constitutional officer who appoints a state
18 employee who is required to file a financial disclosure statement to submit to the
19 Secretary of State a list of each such state employee appointed by the constitutional
20 officer. Sections 1-1.35, 1.5 and 13 of this bill make additional conforming
21 changes to incorporate such public employees into the existing provisions of the
22 Act.
23 The Act requires the disclosure of: (1) the specific location and use of certain
24 real estate, other than a personal residence, located in this State or an adjacent state

28 candidate or member of the public officer’s or candidate’s household is involved as
29 a holder of a class of stock or security representing 1 percent or more of the total
30 outstanding stock or securities issued by the business entity. (NRS 281.571)
31 Section 1.5 of this bill removes the requirement that only real estate located in this
32 State or an adjacent State be disclosed. Section 1.5 additionally requires the
33 disclosure of each: (1) business entity with which the public officer, state employee
34 or candidate or a member of the public officer’s, state employee’s or candidate’s

37 certain exceptions, held by the public officer, state employee or candidate that is
38 valued at more than $5,000.
39 Existing law requires certain persons who make independent expenditures and
40 certain committees for political action, political parties and committees sponsored
41 by a political party which receive certain contributions or make certain
42 expenditures to report such contributions and expenditures. (NRS 294A.140,
43 294A.150, 294A.210, 294A.220, 294A.230) Section 5 of this bill requires an
44 inaugural committee to report certain contributions and expenditures. Section 4 of
45 this bill defines the term “inaugural committee.”
46 Existing law requires a candidate for office at a primary election or general
47 election to report certain contributions made during the election year. (NRS
48 294A.120) Section 6 of this bill requires a candidate who has been elected to a
49 constitutional office to report certain contributions and expenditures in relation to
50 the transition to the constitutional office. Section 3 of this bill defines the terms
51 “constitutional office” and “constitutional officer.”
52 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the terms defined in
53 sections 3 and 4 to certain provisions of law governing campaign practices.
54 Section 8 of this bill prohibits a foreign national from making a contribution or
55 a commitment to make a contribution to an inaugural committee.
56 Sections 9-12 of this bill make conforming changes to incorporate the
57 requirements of sections 5 and 6 into existing law governing campaign practices.
