Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Financial Disclosure Act requires certain public officers and candidates for
2 public office to disclose certain information in financial disclosure statements filed with the
3 Secretary of State. (NRS 281.005, 281.5555-281.581) [In part, existing law] Section 1.4 of
4 this bill requires a state employee to file a financial disclosure statement with the
5 Secretary of State if the state employee: (1) is appointed to a position of employment by a
6 constitutional officer; (2) is in neither the classified or unclassified service of this State;
7 (3) serves at the pleasure of the constitutional officer; and (4) is not otherwise a public
8 officer. Section 1.9 of this bill applies certain existing civil penalties to such a state
9 employee who willfully fails to file a financial disclosure statement or willfully fails to file
10 a financial disclosure statement in a timely manner.
11 Section 1.7 of this bill provides that, for a state employee who serves more than 1
12 year in the same position of employment or more than one position of employment for
13 which a financial disclosure statement is required, the date of filing of the last financial
14 statement is the date which begins the period in which such statements must be retained
15 by the Secretary of State.

Assembly Amendment No. 777 to Senate Bill No. 414 Page 4
16 Section 1.8 of this bill requires each constitutional officer who appoints a state
17 employee who is required to file a financial disclosure statement to submit to the
18 Secretary of State a list of each such state employee appointed by the constitutional
19 officer. Sections 1-1.35, 1.5 and 13 of this bill make additional conforming changes to
20 incorporate such public employees into the existing provisions of the Act.
21 The Act requires the disclosure of : (1) the specific location and use of certain real
22 estate, other than a personal residence, located in this State or an adjacent state in which
23 the public officer, candidate or member of the public officer’s or candidate’s household
24 has a legal or beneficial interest and whose fair market value is $2,500 or more; and (2)
25 each business entity with which the public officer or candidate or member of the public
26 officer’s or candidate’s household is involved as a holder of a class of stock or security
27 representing 1 percent or more of the total outstanding stock or securities issued by the
28 business entity. (NRS 281.571) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill removes the requirement that
29 only real estate located in this State or an adjacent State be disclosed. Section 1.5
30 additionally requires the disclosure of each : (1) business entity with which the public officer ,
31 state employee or candidate or a member of the public officer’s , state employee’s or
32 candidate’s household is involved as a holder of a class of stock or security issued by the

34 certain exceptions, held by the public officer, state employee or candidate that is valued
35 at more than $5,000.
36 Existing law requires certain persons who make independent expenditures and certain
37 committees for political action, political parties and committees sponsored by a political party
38 which receive certain contributions or make certain expenditures to report such contributions
39 and expenditures. (NRS 294A.140, 294A.150, 294A.210, 294A.220, 294A.230) Section 5 of
40 this bill requires an inaugural committee to report certain contributions and expenditures.
41 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “inaugural committee.”
42 Existing law requires a candidate for office at a primary election or general election to
43 report certain contributions made during the election year. (NRS 294A.120) Section 6 of this
44 bill requires a candidate who has been elected to a constitutional office to report certain
45 contributions and expenditures in relation to the transition to the constitutional office. Section
46 3 of this bill defines the terms “constitutional office” and “constitutional officer.”
47 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the terms defined in sections 3
48 and 4 to certain provisions of law governing campaign practices.
49 Section 8 of this bill prohibits a foreign national from making a contribution or a
50 commitment to make a contribution to an inaugural committee.
51 Sections 9-12 of this bill make conforming changes to incorporate the requirements of
52 sections 5 and 6 into existing law governing campaign practices.
