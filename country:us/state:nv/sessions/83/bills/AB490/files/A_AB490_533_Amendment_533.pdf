AN ACT relating to courts; [providing that] revising provisions relating to the
venue for certain proceedings ; [and causes of action may be brought

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the First Judicial District Court has exclusive jurisdiction conferred
2 by statute over certain proceedings, including, without limitation, judicial review of final
3 decisions made by the Secretary of State [, Department of Transportation or Commissioner of
4 Insurance. (NRS 294A.420, 485.290, 693A.665) Existing law also confers the First Judicial
5 District Court with jurisdiction over certain causes of action, including, without limitation,
6 certain criminal petitions and certain disputes related to property. (NRS 34.738, 120A.525,
7 485.290) Section 2 of this bill provides that the jurisdiction conferred by statute to the First
8 Judicial District Court over a cause of action or other proceeding is also conferred by statute
9 to any qualified judicial district. Section 3 of this bill provides that any district court in a
10 judicial district is a qualified judicial district if it has: (1) three or more district judges; (2) an
11 electronic filing, storage and reproduction process; and (3) electronic access to its documents
12 and hearings.] relating to: (1) the designation of certain public buildings for use in
13 gathering signatures on a petition for initiative or referendum that proposes a
14 constitutional amendment or statewide measure; and (2) the verification of signatures on
15 such a petition. (NRS 293.127565, 293.12795) Existing law also provides that whether
16 such an initiative or referendum embraces but one subject and matters necessarily
17 connected therewith and pertaining thereto, and the description of the effect of such an
18 initiative or referendum may be challenged by filing a complaint in the First Judicial
19 District Court. (NRS 295.061)
20 Sections 4-6 of this bill provide that instead of being limited to being filed only in the
21 First Judicial District Court, such petitions for judicial review or complaints, as
22 applicable, may be filed in a qualified district court, which is defined as: (1) the First
23 Judicial District Court, but only if the First Judicial District Court has established and
24 maintains an electronic filing, storage and reproduction process and electronic access to
25 its documents and hearings; or (2) any district court which has at least five district
26 judges and which has established and maintains an electronic filing, storage and
27 reproduction process and electronic access to its documents and hearings.
