Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the First Judicial District Court has exclusive jurisdiction
2 conferred by statute over certain proceedings, including, without limitation, judicial
3 review of final decisions made by the Secretary of State relating to: (1) the
4 designation of certain public buildings for use in gathering signatures on a petition
5 for initiative or referendum that proposes a constitutional amendment or statewide
6 measure; and (2) the verification of signatures on such a petition. (NRS
7 293.127565, 293.12795) Existing law also provides that whether such an initiative
8 or referendum embraces but one subject and matters necessarily connected
9 therewith and pertaining thereto, and the description of the effect of such an
10 initiative or referendum may be challenged by filing a complaint in the First
11 Judicial District Court. (NRS 295.061)
12 Sections 4-6 of this bill provide that instead of being limited to being filed only
13 in the First Judicial District Court, such petitions for judicial review or complaints,
14 as applicable, may be filed in a qualified district court, which is defined as: (1) the
15 First Judicial District Court, but only if the First Judicial District Court has
16 established and maintains an electronic filing, storage and reproduction process and
17 electronic access to its documents and hearings; or (2) any district court which has
18 at least five district judges and which has established and maintains an electronic
19 filing, storage and reproduction process and electronic access to its documents and
