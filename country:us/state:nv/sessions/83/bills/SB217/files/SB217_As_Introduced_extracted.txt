Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill
3 establish certain rights related to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain
4 terms relating to assisted reproduction. Section 7 applies the provisions of sections
5 2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the implementation
6 of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were
7 enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
8 implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
9 and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
10 drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted
11 reproduction; (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted
12 reproduction, any drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
13 related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope of practice, training and
14 experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance coverage of assisted
15 reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4) the ability
16 of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
17 material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental
18 entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to
19 the person, provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1)
20 furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering
21 that interest.
22 Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose
23 ability to access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to
24 assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person
25 whose ability to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
26 material, is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate
27 relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person or
28 entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8 additionally authorizes the Attorney
29 General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or requirement that violates
30 section 8.
31 Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal
32 liability or administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or
33 receives goods or services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides
34 that the manufacturer of certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not
35 subject to civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions solely because of the
36 death of or damage to an embryo. Under section 9, a person or entity is not immune
37 from civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions for acts or omissions that
38 independently create liability or grounds for administrative sanctions, including,
39 without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of practice,
40 training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
41 fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a
42 human body is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
43 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of
44 health insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460,
45 689B.300-689B.330, 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-
46 695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470) Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, 38, 42
47 and 45 of this bill require a health insurer, including public and private employers
48 who provide insurance for their employees, to provide a special enrollment period
49 to a person determined by a qualified provider of health care to be pregnant, during
50 which the pregnant person must be allowed to enroll in a health care plan outside of
51 the period of open enrollment. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement
52 of section 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to
53 employees through a self-insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and
54 criminal penalties for a violation of section 15, which are the same as the penalties
-
*SB217*
– 3 –
55 for violations of other laws governing benefits provided by private employers.
56 Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the
57 applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36, respectively.
58 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
59 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
60 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
61 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
62 695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
63 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
64 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
65 insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
66 insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12-14, 23, 31, 37, 38 and 44 of this bill
67 require Medicaid and public and private health care plans for groups of more than
68 100 insureds to include certain coverage for: (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2)
69 the preservation of fertility where the insured has a medical condition or requires
70 medical treatment that may cause infertility under certain circumstances. Section
71 16 of this bill exempts employers who provide benefits for health care for their
72 employees through a self-insured plan from those requirements. Sections 12-14, 19,
73 23, 31, 37, 38 and 44 of this bill prohibit an insurer from imposing conditions,
74 including cost-sharing, prior authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility
75 treatment or fertility preservation if such conditions are not required for similar
76 benefits that are not related to fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming
77 change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
78 administer the provisions of section 14 in the same manner as other provisions
79 relating to Medicaid. Sections 25, 33 and 40 of this bill make conforming changes
80 to clarify the applicability of provisions indicating that certain insurers are not
81 required to cover fertility drugs.
82 Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
83 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
84 coverage required by section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such
85 action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by
86 sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)

9 penalty within at least 60 days after the person has been confirmed
10 to be pregnant by a qualified provider of health care.
11 2. Coverage for a person who enrolls in coverage pursuant to
12 subsection 1 must be effective:

20 Sec. 43. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding
21 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 44 and 45 of this act.
22 Sec. 44. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, a
23 managed care organization that issues a group health care plan

40 consistent with established medical practice or any guidelines
41 published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine or
42 the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or their successor
43 organizations, that are determined by a qualified provider of
44 health care to be medically necessary to preserve fertility because
45 the insured:
-
*SB217*
– 32 –
1 (1) Has been diagnosed with a medical or genetic condition
2 that may directly or indirectly cause infertility, as determined
3 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 2; or
4 (2) Is expected to receive a medical treatment that may
5 directly or indirectly cause infertility, as determined pursuant to
6 paragraph (b) of subsection 2.
7 2. For the purposes of subsection 1:
8 (a) A medical or genetic condition may directly or indirectly
9 cause infertility if the condition or treatment for the condition is
10 likely to cause infertility, as established by the American Society of
11 Clinical Oncology, the American Society for Reproductive
12 Medicine or the American College of Obstetricians and
13 Gynecologists, or their successor organizations.
14 (b) A medical treatment may directly or indirectly cause
15 infertility if the treatment has a potential side effect of impaired
16 fertility, as established by the American Society of Clinical
17 Oncology or the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, or
18 their successor organizations.
19 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits
20 required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through
21 a provider of health care who participates in the network plan of
22 the managed care organization.
23 4. A managed care organization shall not:
24 (a) Require an insured to pay a higher deductible, copayment,

33 related to fertility;
34 (d) Impose any other exclusions, limitations, restrictions or
35 delays on the access of an insured to any benefit described in
36 subsection 1 that is not imposed on similar benefits that are not
37 related to fertility;
38 (e) Refuse to issue a group health care plan or cancel a group
39 health care plan solely because the person applying for or covered
40 by the plan uses or may use in the future any benefit described in
41 subsection 1;
42 (f) Offer or pay any type of material inducement or financial
43 incentive to an insured to discourage the insured from accessing
44 any benefit described in subsection 1;

6 other financial incentive to a provider of health care to deny,
7 reduce, withhold, limit or delay any benefit described in subsection
8 1 to an insured.
9 5. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a
10 religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
11 required by subsection 1 if the managed care organization objects
12 on religious grounds. Such a managed care organization shall,
13 before the issuance of a group health care plan that is subject to
14 the requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a
15 plan, provide to the group policyholder or prospective insured, as
16 applicable, written notice of the coverage that the managed care
17 organization refuses to provide pursuant to this subsection.
18 6. A group health care plan with more than 100 insureds that
19 is subject to the provisions of this chapter and is delivered, issued
20 for delivery or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, has the legal
21 effect of including the coverage required by subsection 1, and any
22 provision of the plan or the renewal that conflicts with the
23 provisions of this section is void.

22 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), on the first
23 day of the month in which a qualified provider of health care
24 confirms that the person is pregnant; or
25 (b) Upon the election of the person, on the first day of the
26 month after the person elects to enroll in the plan.
27 3. As used in this section, “provider of health care” has the
28 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 629.031.
29 Sec. 46. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 354.599 do
30 not apply to any additional expenses of a local government which
31 are related to the provisions of this act.
32 Sec. 47. 1. This section and section 10 of this act become
33 effective upon passage and approval.
34 2. Sections 1 to 9, inclusive, of this act become effective on
35 July 1, 2025.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill
3 establish certain rights related to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain
4 terms relating to assisted reproduction. Section 7 applies the provisions of sections
5 2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the implementation
6 of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were
7 enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
8 implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
9 and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
10 drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted
11 reproduction; (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted
12 reproduction, any drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
13 related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope of practice, training and
14 experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance coverage of assisted
15 reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4) the ability
16 of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
17 material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental
18 entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to
19 the person, provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1)
20 furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering
21 that interest.
22 Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose
23 ability to access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to
24 assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person
25 whose ability to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
26 material, is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate
27 relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person or
28 entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8 additionally authorizes the Attorney
29 General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or requirement that violates
30 section 8.
31 Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal
32 liability or administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or
33 receives goods or services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides
34 that the manufacturer of certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not
35 subject to civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions solely because of the
36 death of or damage to an embryo. Under section 9, a person or entity is not immune
37 from civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions for acts or omissions that
38 independently create liability or grounds for administrative sanctions, including,
39 without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of practice,
40 training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
41 fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a
42 human body is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
43 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of
44 health insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460,
45 689B.300-689B.330, 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-
46 695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470) Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, 38, 42
47 and 45 of this bill require a health insurer, including public and private employers
48 who provide insurance for their employees, to provide a special enrollment period
49 to a person determined by a qualified provider of health care to be pregnant, during
50 which the pregnant person must be allowed to enroll in a health care plan outside of
51 the period of open enrollment. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement
52 of section 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to
53 employees through a self-insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and
54 criminal penalties for a violation of section 15, which are the same as the penalties
-
*SB217*

– 3 –
55 for violations of other laws governing benefits provided by private employers.
56 Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the
57 applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36, respectively.
58 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
59 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
60 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
61 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
62 695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
63 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
64 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
65 insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
66 insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12-14, 23, 31, 37, 38 and 44 of this bill
67 require Medicaid and public and private health care plans for groups of more than
68 100 insureds to include certain coverage for: (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2)
69 the preservation of fertility where the insured has a medical condition or requires
70 medical treatment that may cause infertility under certain circumstances. Section
71 16 of this bill exempts employers who provide benefits for health care for their
72 employees through a self-insured plan from those requirements. Sections 12-14, 19,
73 23, 31, 37, 38 and 44 of this bill prohibit an insurer from imposing conditions,
74 including cost-sharing, prior authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility
75 treatment or fertility preservation if such conditions are not required for similar
76 benefits that are not related to fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming
77 change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
78 administer the provisions of section 14 in the same manner as other provisions
79 relating to Medicaid. Sections 25, 33 and 40 of this bill make conforming changes
80 to clarify the applicability of provisions indicating that certain insurers are not
81 required to cover fertility drugs.
82 Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
83 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
84 coverage required by section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such
85 action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by
86 sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)

36 related to assisted reproduction;
37 (2) The ability of a provider of health care to:

32 care or third party makes a claim within the scope of sections 2 to

10 or health insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its
11 officers and employees, and the dependents of officers and

14 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the
15 insurance.
16 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance,
17 or any combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and

8 person to enroll in such coverage without any additional fee or
9 penalty within at least 60 days after the person has been confirmed
10 to be pregnant by a qualified provider of health care.
11 2. Coverage for a person who enrolls in coverage pursuant to

20 Sec. 43. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding
21 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 44 and 45 of this act.
22 Sec. 44. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, a

40 consistent with established medical practice or any guidelines
41 published by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine or

1 (1) Has been diagnosed with a medical or genetic condition
2 that may directly or indirectly cause infertility, as determined
3 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 2; or
4 (2) Is expected to receive a medical treatment that may
5 directly or indirectly cause infertility, as determined pursuant to
6 paragraph (b) of subsection 2.
7 2. For the purposes of subsection 1:
8 (a) A medical or genetic condition may directly or indirectly
9 cause infertility if the condition or treatment for the condition is
10 likely to cause infertility, as established by the American Society of
11 Clinical Oncology, the American Society for Reproductive
12 Medicine or the American College of Obstetricians and
13 Gynecologists, or their successor organizations.
14 (b) A medical treatment may directly or indirectly cause

19 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits
20 required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through

22 the managed care organization.
23 4. A managed care organization shall not:

39 health care plan solely because the person applying for or covered
40 by the plan uses or may use in the future any benefit described in
41 subsection 1;
42 (f) Offer or pay any type of material inducement or financial
43 incentive to an insured to discourage the insured from accessing
44 any benefit described in subsection 1;

15 plan, provide to the group policyholder or prospective insured, as
16 applicable, written notice of the coverage that the managed care

23 day of the month in which a qualified provider of health care
24 confirms that the person is pregnant; or
25 (b) Upon the election of the person, on the first day of the
26 month after the person elects to enroll in the plan.

28 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 629.031.
29 Sec. 46. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 354.599 do
30 not apply to any additional expenses of a local government which
31 are related to the provisions of this act.
32 Sec. 47. 1. This section and section 10 of this act become
33 effective upon passage and approval.
34 2. Sections 1 to 9, inclusive, of this act become effective on
35 July 1, 2025.
