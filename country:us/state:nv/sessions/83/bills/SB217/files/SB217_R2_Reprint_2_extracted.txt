Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill
3 establish certain rights related to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain
4 terms relating to assisted reproduction. Section 7 applies the provisions of sections
5 2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the implementation
6 of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were
7 enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
8 implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
9 and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
10 drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted
11 reproduction; (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted
12 reproduction, any drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
13 related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope of practice, training and
14 experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance coverage of assisted
15 reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4) the ability
16 of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
17 material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental
18 entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to
19 the person, provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1)
20 furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering
21 that interest.
22 Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose
23 ability to access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to
24 assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person
25 whose ability to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
26 material, is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate
27 relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person or
28 entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8 additionally authorizes the Attorney
29 General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or requirement that violates
30 section 8.
31 Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal
32 liability or administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or
33 receives goods or services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides
34 that the manufacturer of certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not
35 subject to civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions solely because of the
36 death of or damage to an embryo. Under section 9, a person or entity is not immune
37 from civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions for acts or omissions that
38 independently create liability or grounds for administrative sanctions, including,
39 without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of practice,
40 training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
41 fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a
42 human body is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
43 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of
44 health insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460,
45 689B.300-689B.330, 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-
46 695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470) Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, 42 and
47 45 of this bill require a health insurer, including public and private employers who
48 provide insurance for their employees but excluding certain group plans, to provide
49 a special enrollment period to a person determined by a qualified provider of health
50 care to be pregnant, during which the pregnant person must be allowed to enroll in
51 a health care plan outside of the period of open enrollment. Sections 38, 38.5, 45.2
52 and 45.6 of this bill provide that until January 1, 2027, the requirements of sections
53 36 and 45 to provide such a special enrollment period do not apply to Medicaid
54 managed care plans. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement of
-
*SB217_R2*
– 3 –
55 section 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to
56 employees through a self-insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and
57 criminal penalties for a violation of section 15, which are the same as the penalties
58 for violations of other laws governing benefits provided by private employers.
59 Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the
60 applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36, respectively.
61 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
62 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
63 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
64 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
65 695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
66 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
67 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
68 insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
69 insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12, 23, 31, 37 and 44 of this bill require
70 certain health care plans for groups of more than 50 employees or members,
71 including health plans for employees of local governments, to include certain
72 coverage for: (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2) the preservation of fertility
73 where the insured has a medical condition or requires medical treatment that may
74 cause infertility under certain circumstances. Sections 13.5, 14, 38.7, 45.65, 45.8,
75 45.9 and 47 of this bill impose similar requirements on the Public Employees’
76 Benefits Program and Medicaid, beginning on July 1, 2027. Sections 38 and 45.2
77 exempt Medicaid managed care plans from those requirements before that date.
78 Section 16 of this bill exempts private employers who provide benefits for health
79 care for less than 51 employees through a self-insured plan from the requirements
80 to cover services for the treatment or preservation of fertility. Sections 12, 13.5, 14,
81 19, 23, 31, 37, 38.7, 44, 45.65, 45.8 and 45.9 of this bill prohibit an insurer,
82 including Medicaid, from imposing conditions, including cost-sharing, prior
83 authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility treatment or fertility preservation
84 if such conditions are not required for similar benefits that are not related to
85 fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director
86 of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
87 section 14 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Sections
88 25, 33 and 40 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of
89 provisions indicating that certain insurers are not required to cover fertility drugs.
90 Section 43.5 of this bill defines the term “small employer” for the purpose of
91 section 44 and other provisions governing managed care. Section 45.1 of this bill
92 establishes the applicability of that definition, and section 45.7 of this bill removes
93 a duplicative definition.
94 Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
95 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
96 coverage required by section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such
97 action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by
98 sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill
3 establish certain rights related to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain
4 terms relating to assisted reproduction. Section 7 applies the provisions of sections
5 2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the implementation
6 of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were
7 enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
8 implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
9 and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
10 drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted
11 reproduction; (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted
12 reproduction, any drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
13 related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope of practice, training and
14 experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance coverage of assisted
15 reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4) the ability
16 of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
17 material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental
18 entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to
19 the person, provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1)
20 furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering
21 that interest.
22 Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose
23 ability to access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to
24 assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person
25 whose ability to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
26 material, is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate
27 relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person or
28 entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8 additionally authorizes the Attorney
29 General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or requirement that violates
30 section 8.
31 Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal
32 liability or administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or
33 receives goods or services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides
34 that the manufacturer of certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not
35 subject to civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions solely because of the
36 death of or damage to an embryo. Under section 9, a person or entity is not immune
37 from civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions for acts or omissions that
38 independently create liability or grounds for administrative sanctions, including,
39 without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of practice,
40 training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
41 fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a
42 human body is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
43 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of
44 health insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460,
45 689B.300-689B.330, 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-
46 695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470) Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, 42 and
47 45 of this bill require a health insurer, including public and private employers who
48 provide insurance for their employees but excluding certain group plans, to provide
49 a special enrollment period to a person determined by a qualified provider of health
50 care to be pregnant, during which the pregnant person must be allowed to enroll in
51 a health care plan outside of the period of open enrollment. Sections 38, 38.5, 45.2
52 and 45.6 of this bill provide that until January 1, 2027, the requirements of sections
53 36 and 45 to provide such a special enrollment period do not apply to Medicaid
54 managed care plans. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement of
-
*SB217_R2*

– 3 –
55 section 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to
56 employees through a self-insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and
57 criminal penalties for a violation of section 15, which are the same as the penalties
58 for violations of other laws governing benefits provided by private employers.
59 Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the
60 applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36, respectively.
61 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
62 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
63 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
64 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
65 695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
66 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
67 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
68 insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
69 insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12, 23, 31, 37 and 44 of this bill require
70 certain health care plans for groups of more than 50 employees or members,
71 including health plans for employees of local governments, to include certain
72 coverage for: (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2) the preservation of fertility
73 where the insured has a medical condition or requires medical treatment that may
74 cause infertility under certain circumstances. Sections 13.5, 14, 38.7, 45.65, 45.8,
75 45.9 and 47 of this bill impose similar requirements on the Public Employees’
76 Benefits Program and Medicaid, beginning on July 1, 2027. Sections 38 and 45.2
77 exempt Medicaid managed care plans from those requirements before that date.
78 Section 16 of this bill exempts private employers who provide benefits for health
79 care for less than 51 employees through a self-insured plan from the requirements
80 to cover services for the treatment or preservation of fertility. Sections 12, 13.5, 14,
81 19, 23, 31, 37, 38.7, 44, 45.65, 45.8 and 45.9 of this bill prohibit an insurer,
82 including Medicaid, from imposing conditions, including cost-sharing, prior
83 authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility treatment or fertility preservation
84 if such conditions are not required for similar benefits that are not related to
85 fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director
86 of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
87 section 14 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Sections
88 25, 33 and 40 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of
89 provisions indicating that certain insurers are not required to cover fertility drugs.
90 Section 43.5 of this bill defines the term “small employer” for the purpose of
91 section 44 and other provisions governing managed care. Section 45.1 of this bill
92 establishes the applicability of that definition, and section 45.7 of this bill removes
93 a duplicative definition.
94 Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
95 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
96 coverage required by section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such
97 action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by
98 sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)
