CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a governmental entity
from substantially burdening certain activity relating to
assisted reproduction under certain circumstances;
authorizing a person whose engagement in such activity has
been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim or defense
in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to award
damages against a governmental entity that substantially
burdens such activity in certain circumstances; providing
certain immunity from civil and criminal liability and
administrative sanctions for certain persons and entities
involved in the provision of assisted reproduction; providing
that a fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before
implantation in a human uterus is not a person for legal
purposes; requiring certain health insurers to authorize a
pregnant person to enroll in a health plan during a specified
period; requiring certain public and private health insurers to
provide certain coverage for the treatment of infertility and
fertility preservation; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill
establish certain rights related to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain
terms relating to assisted reproduction. Section 7 applies the provisions of sections
2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the implementation
of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were
enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted
reproduction; (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted
reproduction, any drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope of practice, training and
experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance coverage of assisted
reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4) the ability
of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental
entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to
the person, provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1)
furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering
that interest.

Section 2:
Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose
ability to access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person
whose ability to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
material, is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate
relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person or
entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8 additionally authorizes the Attorney
General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or requirement that violates

Section 3:
section 8.

Section 4:
Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal
liability or administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or
receives goods or services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides
that the manufacturer of certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not
subject to civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions solely because of the
death of or damage to an embryo. Under section 9, a person or entity is not immune
from civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions for acts or omissions that
independently create liability or grounds for administrative sanctions, including,
without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of practice,
training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a
human body is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of
health insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460,
689B.300-689B.330, 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-
695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470) Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, 42 and
45 of this bill require a health insurer, including public and private employers who
provide insurance for their employees but excluding certain group plans, to provide
a special enrollment period to a person determined by a qualified provider of health
care to be pregnant, during which the pregnant person must be allowed to enroll in
a health care plan outside of the period of open enrollment. Sections 38, 38.5, 45.2
and 45.6 of this bill provide that until January 1, 2027, the requirements of sections
36 and 45 to provide such a special enrollment period do not apply to Medicaid
managed care plans. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement of

Section 5:
section 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to
employees through a self-insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and
criminal penalties for a violation of section 15, which are the same as the penalties
for violations of other laws governing benefits provided by private employers.

Section 6:
Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the
applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36, respectively.
Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,

Section 7:
422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12, 23, 31, 37 and 44 of this bill require
certain health care plans for groups of more than 50 employees or members,
including health plans for employees of local governments, to include certain
coverage for: (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2) the preservation of fertility
where the insured has a medical condition or requires medical treatment that may
cause infertility under certain circumstances. Sections 13.5, 14, 38.7, 45.65, 45.8,

Section 8:
45.9 and 47 of this bill impose similar requirements on the Public Employees’
Benefits Program and Medicaid, beginning on July 1, 2027. Sections 38 and 45.2
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
exempt Medicaid managed care plans from those requirements before that date.

Section 9:
Section 16 of this bill exempts private employers who provide benefits for health
care for less than 51 employees through a self-insured plan from the requirements
to cover services for the treatment or preservation of fertility. Sections 12, 13.5, 14,
19, 23, 31, 37, 38.7, 44, 45.65, 45.8 and 45.9 of this bill prohibit an insurer,
including Medicaid, from imposing conditions, including cost-sharing, prior
authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility treatment or fertility preservation
if such conditions are not required for similar benefits that are not related to
fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director
of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of

Section 10:
section 14 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Sections
25, 33 and 40 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of
provisions indicating that certain insurers are not required to cover fertility drugs.

Section 11:
Section 43.5 of this bill defines the term “small employer” for the purpose of

Section 12:
section 44 and other provisions governing managed care. Section 45.1 of this bill
establishes the applicability of that definition, and section 45.7 of this bill removes
a duplicative definition.

Section 13:
Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
coverage required by section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such
action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by

Section 14:
sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 217–Senators Cannizzaro, Nguyen, Scheible,
Pazina, Dondero Loop; Cruz-Crawford, Daly, Doñate,
Flores, Lange, Neal, Ohrenschall and Taylor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a governmental entity
from substantially burdening certain activity relating to
assisted reproduction under certain circumstances;
authorizing a person whose engagement in such activity has
been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim or defense
in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to award
damages against a governmental entity that substantially
burdens such activity in certain circumstances; providing
certain immunity from civil and criminal liability and
administrative sanctions for certain persons and entities
involved in the provision of assisted reproduction; providing
that a fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before
implantation in a human uterus is not a person for legal
purposes; requiring certain health insurers to authorize a
pregnant person to enroll in a health plan during a specified
period; requiring certain public and private health insurers to
provide certain coverage for the treatment of infertility and
fertility preservation; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill
establish certain rights related to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain
terms relating to assisted reproduction. Section 7 applies the provisions of sections
2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the implementation
of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were
enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted
reproduction; (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted
reproduction, any drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope of practice, training and
experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance coverage of assisted
reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4) the ability
of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental
entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to
the person, provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1)
furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering
that interest.
Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose
ability to access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person
whose ability to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
material, is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate
relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person or
entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8 additionally authorizes the Attorney
General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or requirement that violates
section 8.
Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal
liability or administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or
receives goods or services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides
that the manufacturer of certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not
subject to civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions solely because of the
death of or damage to an embryo. Under section 9, a person or entity is not immune
from civil or criminal liability or administrative sanctions for acts or omissions that
independently create liability or grounds for administrative sanctions, including,
without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of practice,
training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a
human body is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of
health insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460,
689B.300-689B.330, 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-
695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470) Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, 42 and
45 of this bill require a health insurer, including public and private employers who
provide insurance for their employees but excluding certain group plans, to provide
a special enrollment period to a person determined by a qualified provider of health
care to be pregnant, during which the pregnant person must be allowed to enroll in
a health care plan outside of the period of open enrollment. Sections 38, 38.5, 45.2
and 45.6 of this bill provide that until January 1, 2027, the requirements of sections
36 and 45 to provide such a special enrollment period do not apply to Medicaid
managed care plans. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement of
section 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to
employees through a self-insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and
criminal penalties for a violation of section 15, which are the same as the penalties
for violations of other laws governing benefits provided by private employers.
Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the
applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36, respectively.
Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12, 23, 31, 37 and 44 of this bill require
certain health care plans for groups of more than 50 employees or members,
including health plans for employees of local governments, to include certain
coverage for: (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2) the preservation of fertility
where the insured has a medical condition or requires medical treatment that may
cause infertility under certain circumstances. Sections 13.5, 14, 38.7, 45.65, 45.8,
45.9 and 47 of this bill impose similar requirements on the Public Employees’
Benefits Program and Medicaid, beginning on July 1, 2027. Sections 38 and 45.2
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
exempt Medicaid managed care plans from those requirements before that date.
Section 16 of this bill exempts private employers who provide benefits for health
care for less than 51 employees through a self-insured plan from the requirements
to cover services for the treatment or preservation of fertility. Sections 12, 13.5, 14,
19, 23, 31, 37, 38.7, 44, 45.65, 45.8 and 45.9 of this bill prohibit an insurer,
including Medicaid, from imposing conditions, including cost-sharing, prior
authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility treatment or fertility preservation
if such conditions are not required for similar benefits that are not related to
fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director
of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
section 14 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Sections
25, 33 and 40 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of
provisions indicating that certain insurers are not required to cover fertility drugs.
Section 43.5 of this bill defines the term “small employer” for the purpose of
section 44 and other provisions governing managed care. Section 45.1 of this bill
establishes the applicability of that definition, and section 45.7 of this bill removes
a duplicative definition.
Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
coverage required by section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such
action against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by
sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)

not authorize a governmental entity to burden:
(a) The access of any person to assisted reproduction, any
drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
related to assisted reproduction;

out assisted reproduction or any drug or device related to assisted
reproduction and substantially burdens:
(1) The access of a person to assisted reproduction, any
drug or device related to assisted reproduction or information
related to assisted reproduction;
(2) The ability of a provider of health care to:
(I) Provide assisted reproduction or information related
to assisted reproduction within the scope of practice, training and
experience of the provider of health care; or
(II) Provide, administer, dispense or prescribe any drug
or device related to assisted reproduction within the scope of
practice, training and experience of the provider of health care; or

2. A governmental entity may enact a requirement or

demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden
imposed by the requirement or limitation described in subsection

(a) Furthers a compelling interest; and
(b) Is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.

5. A court may find that a person, provider of health care or
third party is a vexatious litigant if the person, provider of health
care or third party makes a claim within the scope of sections 2 to
9, inclusive, of this act which is without merit, fraudulent or
otherwise intended to harass or annoy a person or entity. If a
court finds that a person, provider of health care or third party is a
vexatious litigant pursuant to this subsection, the court may deny
standing to that person, provider of health care or third party to
bring further claims which allege a violation of this section.
Sec. 9. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a

2. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person or
entity that stores or transports embryos for the purpose of assisted
reproduction or the manufacturer of goods used to facilitate the
process of assisted reproduction or the transportation of embryos
-

gives rise to such liability, including, without limitation, acts or
omissions that are the result of negligence;
(b) Criminal liability for any act or omission that would
otherwise constitute a crime; or
(c) The imposition of discipline or other administrative
