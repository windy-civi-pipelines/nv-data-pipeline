AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a governmental entity from
substantially burdening certain activity relating to assisted reproduction
under certain circumstances; authorizing a person whose engagement
in such activity has been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim
or defense in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to award
damages against a governmental entity that substantially burdens such
activity in certain circumstances; providing certain immunity from
civil and criminal liability and administrative sanctions for certain
persons and entities involved in the provision of assisted reproduction;
providing that a fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before
implantation in a human uterus is not a person for legal purposes;
requiring certain health insurers to authorize a pregnant person to
enroll in a health plan during a specified period; requiring certain
public and private health insurers to provide certain coverage for the
treatment of infertility and fertility preservation; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a facility for the
2 dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish certain rights related
3 to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain terms relating to assisted reproduction.
4 Section 7 applies the provisions of sections 2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and
5 ordinances and the implementation of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those
6 laws or ordinances were enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from
7 enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
8 and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any drug or
9 device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction; (2) the
10 ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted reproduction, any drug or device related
Senate Amendment No. 757 to Senate Bill No. 217 First Reprint Page 4
11 to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope
12 of practice, training and experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance
13 coverage of assisted reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4)
14 the ability of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
15 material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental entity
16 demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to the person,
17 provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a compelling
18 interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
19 Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose ability to
20 access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to assisted
21 reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person whose ability to
22 control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic material, is burdened to bring
23 or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award
24 costs and attorney’s fees to a person or entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8
25 additionally authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or
26 requirement that violates section 8.
27 Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal liability or
28 administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or receives goods or
29 services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides that the manufacturer of
30 certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not subject to civil or criminal liability
31 or administrative sanctions solely because of the death of or damage to an embryo. Under
32 section 9, a person or entity is not immune from civil or criminal liability or administrative
33 sanctions for acts or omissions that independently create liability or grounds for administrative
34 sanctions, including, without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of
35 practice, training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
36 fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a human body
37 is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
38 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of health
39 insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460, 689B.300-689B.330,
40 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470)
41 Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, [38,] 42 and 45 of this bill require a health insurer,
42 including public and private employers who provide insurance for their employees but
43 excluding certain group plans, to provide a special enrollment period to a person determined
44 by a qualified provider of health care to be pregnant, during which the pregnant person must
45 be allowed to enroll in a health care plan outside of the period of open enrollment. Sections
46 38, 38.5, 45.2 and 45.6 of this bill provide that until January 1, 2027, the requirements of
47 [section] sections 36 and 45 to provide such a special enrollment period do not apply to
48 Medicaid managed care plans. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement of section
49 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to employees through a self-
50 insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for a violation of
51 section 15, which are the same as the penalties for violations of other laws governing benefits
52 provided by private employers. Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming
53 changes to indicate the applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36,
54 respectively.
55 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated under
56 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428,
57 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194,
58 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948,
59 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers
60 to provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
61 health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
62 insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12, [13,] 23, 31, 37 and 44 of this bill require [public
63 and private] certain health care plans for groups of more than 50 employees or members ,
64 including health plans for employees of local governments, to include certain coverage for:
65 (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2) the preservation of fertility where the insured has a
66 medical condition or requires medical treatment that may cause infertility under certain
67 circumstances. Sections 13.5, 14, [38.5, 45.6] 38.7, 45.65, 45.8, 45.9 and 47 of this bill
68 impose similar requirements on the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and Medicaid,
69 beginning on [January] July 1, 2027. Sections 38 and 45.2 exempt Medicaid managed care
Senate Amendment No. 757 to Senate Bill No. 217 First Reprint Page 5
70 plans from those requirements before that date. Section 16 of this bill exempts private
71 employers who provide benefits for health care for [their] less than 51 employees through a
72 self-insured plan from the requirements to cover services for the treatment or preservation of
73 fertility. Sections [12-14,] 12, 13.5, 14, 19, 23, 31, 37, [38.5 and] 38.7, 44 , 45.65, 45.8 and
74 45.9 of this bill prohibit an insurer, including Medicaid, from imposing conditions, including
75 cost-sharing, prior authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility treatment or fertility
76 preservation if such conditions are not required for similar benefits that are not related to
77 fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
78 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 14 in the
79 same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Sections 25, 33 and 40 of this bill
80 make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of provisions indicating that certain
81 insurers are not required to cover fertility drugs. Section 43.5 of this bill defines the term
82 “small employer” for the purpose of section 44 and other provisions governing managed
83 care. Section 45.1 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition, and section
84 45.7 of this bill removes a duplicative definition.
85 Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or revoke the
86 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage required by
87 section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action against other health
88 insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a governmental entity from
substantially burdening certain activity relating to assisted reproduction
under certain circumstances; authorizing a person whose engagement
in such activity has been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim
or defense in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to award
damages against a governmental entity that substantially burdens such
activity in certain circumstances; providing certain immunity from
civil and criminal liability and administrative sanctions for certain
persons and entities involved in the provision of assisted reproduction;
providing that a fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before
implantation in a human uterus is not a person for legal purposes;
requiring certain health insurers to authorize a pregnant person to
enroll in a health plan during a specified period; requiring certain
public and private health insurers to provide certain coverage for the
treatment of infertility and fertility preservation; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a facility for the
2 dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish certain rights related
3 to assisted reproduction. Sections 3-6 define certain terms relating to assisted reproduction.
4 Section 7 applies the provisions of sections 2-9 to certain state laws and all local laws and
5 ordinances and the implementation of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those
6 laws or ordinances were enacted. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from
7 enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out assisted reproduction
8 and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to assisted reproduction, any drug or
9 device related to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction; (2) the
10 ability of a provider of health care to provide assisted reproduction, any drug or device related

Senate Amendment No. 757 to Senate Bill No. 217 First Reprint Page 4
11 to assisted reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction within his or her scope
12 of practice, training and experience; (3) the ability of a third party to provide insurance
13 coverage of assisted reproduction or drugs or devices related to assisted reproduction; or (4)
14 the ability of a person to control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic
15 material. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental entity
16 demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to the person,
17 provider of health care or third party who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a compelling
18 interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.
19 Section 8 authorizes a person, provider of health care or third party whose ability to
20 access, provide or cover assisted reproduction, drugs or devices related to assisted
21 reproduction or information related to assisted reproduction, or a person whose ability to
22 control the use or disposition of his or her reproductive genetic material, is burdened to bring
23 or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award
24 costs and attorney’s fees to a person or entity who prevails on such a claim. Section 8
25 additionally authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action to enjoin any limitation or
26 requirement that violates section 8.
27 Section 9 provides that a person or entity is not subject to civil or criminal liability or
28 administrative sanctions solely because the person or entity provides or receives goods or
29 services related to assisted reproduction. Section 9 also provides that the manufacturer of
30 certain goods used to facilitate assisted reproduction is not subject to civil or criminal liability
31 or administrative sanctions solely because of the death of or damage to an embryo. Under
32 section 9, a person or entity is not immune from civil or criminal liability or administrative
33 sanctions for acts or omissions that independently create liability or grounds for administrative
34 sanctions, including, without limitation, negligence or providing services outside the scope of
35 practice, training or experience of the person or entity. Section 10 of this bill provides that a
36 fertilized egg or human embryo that exists before implantation in the uterus of a human body
37 is not a human being for any purpose under Nevada law.
38 Existing law prescribes certain requirements governing the availability of health
39 insurance plans in this State. (NRS 687B.480, 689A.430-689A.460, 689B.300-689B.330,
40 695A.151-695A.157, 695B.340-695B.370, 695C.163-695C.169, 695F.440-695F.470)
41 Sections 12, 13, 15, 20, 24, 27-29, 32, 36, [38,] 42 and 45 of this bill require a health insurer,
42 including public and private employers who provide insurance for their employees but
43 excluding certain group plans, to provide a special enrollment period to a person determined
44 by a qualified provider of health care to be pregnant, during which the pregnant person must
45 be allowed to enroll in a health care plan outside of the period of open enrollment. Sections
46 38, 38.5, 45.2 and 45.6 of this bill provide that until January 1, 2027, the requirements of
47 [section] sections 36 and 45 to provide such a special enrollment period do not apply to
48 Medicaid managed care plans. Section 17 of this bill provides for the enforcement of section
49 15, which governs private employers who provide health benefits to employees through a self-
50 insured plan. Section 18 of this bill establishes civil and criminal penalties for a violation of
51 section 15, which are the same as the penalties for violations of other laws governing benefits
52 provided by private employers. Sections 21, 26, 34 and 39 of this bill make conforming
53 changes to indicate the applicability of certain definitions to sections 20, 24, 32 and 36,
54 respectively.
55 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated under
56 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428,
57 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194,
58 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948,
59 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers
60 to provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
61 health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees through a self-
62 insured plan. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 12, [13,] 23, 31, 37 and 44 of this bill require [public
63 and private] certain health care plans for groups of more than 50 employees or members ,
64 including health plans for employees of local governments, to include certain coverage for:
65 (1) the treatment of infertility; and (2) the preservation of fertility where the insured has a
66 medical condition or requires medical treatment that may cause infertility under certain
67 circumstances. Sections 13.5, 14, [38.5, 45.6] 38.7, 45.65, 45.8, 45.9 and 47 of this bill
68 impose similar requirements on the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and Medicaid,
69 beginning on [January] July 1, 2027. Sections 38 and 45.2 exempt Medicaid managed care

Senate Amendment No. 757 to Senate Bill No. 217 First Reprint Page 5
70 plans from those requirements before that date. Section 16 of this bill exempts private
71 employers who provide benefits for health care for [their] less than 51 employees through a
72 self-insured plan from the requirements to cover services for the treatment or preservation of
73 fertility. Sections [12-14,] 12, 13.5, 14, 19, 23, 31, 37, [38.5 and] 38.7, 44 , 45.65, 45.8 and
74 45.9 of this bill prohibit an insurer, including Medicaid, from imposing conditions, including
75 cost-sharing, prior authorizations and waiting periods, on infertility treatment or fertility
76 preservation if such conditions are not required for similar benefits that are not related to
77 fertility. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
78 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 14 in the
79 same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Sections 25, 33 and 40 of this bill
80 make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of provisions indicating that certain
81 insurers are not required to cover fertility drugs. Section 43.5 of this bill defines the term
82 “small employer” for the purpose of section 44 and other provisions governing managed
83 care. Section 45.1 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition, and section
84 45.7 of this bill removes a duplicative definition.
85 Section 41 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or revoke the
86 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage required by
87 section 37. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action against other health
88 insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections 23 and 44. (NRS 680A.200)
