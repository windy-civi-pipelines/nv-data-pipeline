EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the support of children; revising the duties of the Administrator
of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department
of Health and Human Services; revising certain procedures and
requirements relating to the collection of support of children;
requiring the collecting and reporting of certain demographic
information; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each state to establish procedures under which the state has
2 the authority to withhold or suspend, or to restrict, the use of driver’s licenses and
3 professional, occupational and recreational licenses of a person who: (1) has failed, after
4 receiving notice, to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child support
5 proceedings; or (2) is in arrears in the payment of support for one or more children. (42 U.S.C.
6 § 666) Existing law requires the district attorney or other public agency collecting support for
7 children to report to the Department of Motor Vehicles the name of a person who has, after
8 receiving notice, failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child
9 support proceedings or who is in arrears in the payment of support for one or more children.
10 (NRS 425.510) After receiving such a report, existing law requires the Department to suspend
11 the driver’s license and, if applicable, the motorcycle driver’s license of the person. (NRS
12 483.443, 486.165)
13 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, rather than requires, the district attorney or other public
14 agency to provide such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles. However, section 1
15 prohibits such a report from being made to the Department if the suspension of the driver’s
16 license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person named in the report would be an
17 impediment to his or her present or potential employment. Section 1 also provides that, for the
18 purposes of issuing such a report to the Department, a person is not in arrears in the payment
19 of support for one or more children unless the person: (1) is delinquent for not less than [6] 3
20 months in support payments or any payments ordered by a court for arrearages in such
21 payments; or (2) has failed to provide medical insurance for a child as required by a court
22 order. Section 1 also requires each district attorney or other public agency: (1) to collect
23 and maintain certain demographic data concerning persons who were sent a notice
24 concerning a subpoena, warrant or arrearage, and persons whose names were reported
25 to the Department; and (2) to annually submit a report to the Legislature concerning

Senate Amendment No. 358 to Senate Bill No. 390 Page 4
26 such data. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify the applicability of
27 provisions governing when a person is in arrears for the support of one or more children for
28 the purposes of other provisions providing for the suspension of professional, occupational
29 and recreational licenses.
30 Under existing law, whenever a district attorney or other public agency collecting support
31 for children is required to make such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, the district
32 attorney or other public agency must also make such a report the Department of Wildlife.
33 (NRS 425.510) Existing law requires the Department of Wildlife to suspend a license or
34 permit to hunt, fish or trap issued to the person named in the report, unless, within 30 days, the
35 person provides certain proof of compliance with the subpoena or warrant or satisfaction of
36 the arrearage. (NRS 502.115, 503.5835) Because section 1 changes the circumstances under
37 which the district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children may make
38 such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, section 4 of this bill makes conforming
39 changes to maintain the existing procedures currently in effect for making such reports to the
40 Department of Wildlife, thereby retaining: (1) the requirement that the district attorney or
41 public agency collecting support for children make reports to the Department of Wildlife; and
42 (2) the criteria under existing law for determining when a person is in arrears in the payment
43 of support for one or more children for those purposes. (NRS 425.510, 425.560) Section 3 of
44 this bill establishes the applicability of definitions.
45 Existing federal law requires each state to develop a program for the purpose of locating
46 absent parents, establishing the paternity of children and establishing and collecting payment
47 obligations for the support of children. Existing federal law makes certain federal funding and
48 payments contingent on the performance of each state in carrying out such a program. (42
49 U.S.C. §§ 651 et seq.) Existing law provides that the Administrator of the Division of Welfare
50 and Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for
51 carrying out and supervising the program of this State for those purposes. (NRS 425.365)
52 Section 2 of this bill requires the Administrator to make every effort to obtain the approval
53 necessary from the United States Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that the
54 program in this State complies with all the requirements for the receipt of such federal funds.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 425 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new

6 to determine the paternity of a child or to establish or enforce an obligation for
7 the support of a child; or
8 (b) Is in arrears in the payment for the support of one or more children.

20 her present or potential employment.

Senate Amendment No. 358 to Senate Bill No. 390 Page 5
1 3. Before a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 2 may be held, the
2 person requesting the hearing and a representative of the enforcing authority

7 person of the recommendation of the master at the conclusion of the hearing or
8 as soon thereafter as is practicable. If the master determines that the person has
9 failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to a proceeding to determine
10 the paternity of a child or to establish or enforce an obligation for the support of
11 a child, the master shall include in the notice the information set forth in

13 for the support of one or more children, the master shall include in the notice the

16 to subsection 2 has not complied with a subpoena or warrant relating to a
17 proceeding to determine the paternity of a child or to establish or enforce an
18 obligation for the support of a child and the district court issues an order
19 approving the recommendation of the master, the district attorney or other public
20 agency may report the name of that person to the Department of Motor Vehicles,
21 unless the suspension of the driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of
22 the person would be an impediment to his or her present or potential employment.
23 6. If the master determines that a person who requested a hearing pursuant
24 to subsection 2 is in arrears in the payment for the support of one or more
25 children, the master shall notify the person that if the person does not
26 immediately agree to enter into a plan for the repayment of the arrearages that is
27 approved by the district attorney or other public agency, the driver’s license and
28 motorcycle driver’s license of the person may be subject to suspension. If the
29 person does not agree to enter into such a plan and the district court issues an
30 order approving the recommendation of the master, the district attorney or other
31 public agency may report the name of that person to the Department of Motor
32 Vehicles, unless the suspension of the driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s
33 license of the person would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
34 employment.
35 7. The district attorney or other public agency shall, within 5 days after the
36 person who has failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant or is in arrears in
37 the payment for the support of one or more children complies with the subpoena

47 Vehicles pursuant to subsection 2.
