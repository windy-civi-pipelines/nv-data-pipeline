SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the support of
children. (BDR 38-85)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the support of children; revising the duties of
the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and
Supportive Services of the Department of Health
and Human Services; revising certain procedures and
requirements relating to the collection of support of
children; requiring the collecting and reporting of certain
demographic information; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each state to establish procedures under which the
2 state has the authority to withhold or suspend, or to restrict, the use of driver’s
3 licenses and professional, occupational and recreational licenses of a person who:
4 (1) has failed, after receiving notice, to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating
5 to paternity or child support proceedings; or (2) is in arrears in the payment of
6 support for one or more children. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Existing law requires the
7 district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children to report to
8 the Department of Motor Vehicles the name of a person who has, after receiving
9 notice, failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child
10 support proceedings or who is in arrears in the payment of support for one or more
11 children. (NRS 425.510) After receiving such a report, existing law requires the
12 Department to suspend the driver’s license and, if applicable, the motorcycle
13 driver’s license of the person. (NRS 483.443, 486.165)
14 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, rather than requires, the district attorney or
15 other public agency to provide such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
16 However, section 1 prohibits such a report from being made to the Department if
17 the suspension of the driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person
-
*SB390_R1*
– 2 –
18 named in the report would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
19 employment. Section 1 also provides that, for the purposes of issuing such a report
20 to the Department, a person is not in arrears in the payment of support for one or
21 more children unless the person: (1) is delinquent for not less than 3 months in
22 support payments or any payments ordered by a court for arrearages in such
23 payments; or (2) has failed to provide medical insurance for a child as required by a
24 court order. Section 1 also requires each district attorney or other public agency:
25 (1) to collect and maintain certain demographic data concerning persons who were
26 sent a notice concerning a subpoena, warrant or arrearage, and persons whose
27 names were reported to the Department; and (2) to annually submit a report to the
28 Legislature concerning such data. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change
29 to clarify the applicability of provisions governing when a person is in arrears for
30 the support of one or more children for the purposes of other provisions providing
31 for the suspension of professional, occupational and recreational licenses.
32 Under existing law, whenever a district attorney or other public agency
33 collecting support for children is required to make such a report to the Department
34 of Motor Vehicles, the district attorney or other public agency must also make such
35 a report the Department of Wildlife. (NRS 425.510) Existing law requires the
36 Department of Wildlife to suspend a license or permit to hunt, fish or trap issued to
37 the person named in the report, unless, within 30 days, the person provides certain
38 proof of compliance with the subpoena or warrant or satisfaction of the arrearage.
39 (NRS 502.115, 503.5835) Because section 1 changes the circumstances under
40 which the district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children
41 may make such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, section 4 of this bill
42 makes conforming changes to maintain the existing procedures currently in effect
43 for making such reports to the Department of Wildlife, thereby retaining: (1) the
44 requirement that the district attorney or public agency collecting support for
45 children make reports to the Department of Wildlife; and (2) the criteria under
46 existing law for determining when a person is in arrears in the payment of support
47 for one or more children for those purposes. (NRS 425.510, 425.560) Section 3 of
48 this bill establishes the applicability of definitions.
49 Existing federal law requires each state to develop a program for the purpose of
50 locating absent parents, establishing the paternity of children and establishing and
51 collecting payment obligations for the support of children. Existing federal law
52 makes certain federal funding and payments contingent on the performance of each
53 state in carrying out such a program. (42 U.S.C. §§ 651 et seq.) Existing law
54 provides that the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services
55 of the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for carrying out
56 and supervising the program of this State for those purposes. (NRS 425.365)
57 Section 2 of this bill requires the Administrator to make every effort to obtain the
58 approval necessary from the United States Department of Health and Human
59 Services to ensure that the program in this State complies with all the requirements
60 for the receipt of such federal funds.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 425 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:

2 to a proceeding to determine the paternity of a child or to establish
3 or enforce an obligation for the support of a child; or
4 (b) Is in arrears in the payment for the support of one or more
5 children.
6  The notice must include the information set forth in subsection
7 2 and a copy of the subpoena or warrant or a statement of the
8 amount of the arrearage.
9 2. If the person does not, within 30 days after the person
10 receives the notice required by subsection 1:
11 (a) Comply with the subpoena or warrant;
12 (b) Satisfy the arrearage pursuant to paragraph (b) of
13 subsection 9; or
14 (c) Submit to the district attorney or other public agency a

16  the district attorney or other public agency may report the name
17 of that person to the Department of Motor Vehicles, unless the

19 of the person would be an impediment to his or her present or
20 potential employment.
21 3. Before a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 2 may
22 be held, the person requesting the hearing and a representative of
23 the enforcing authority must meet and make a good faith effort to
24 resolve the matter.
25 4. If a person requests a hearing within the period prescribed
26 in subsection 2 and meets with the enforcing authority as required
27 pursuant to subsection 3, a hearing must be held pursuant to NRS
28 425.3832. The master shall notify the person of the
29 recommendation of the master at the conclusion of the hearing or

32 relating to a proceeding to determine the paternity of a child or to
33 establish or enforce an obligation for the support of a child, the
34 master shall include in the notice the information set forth in
35 subsection 5. If the master determines that the person is in arrears
36 in the payment for the support of one or more children, the master
37 shall include in the notice the information set forth in

39 5. If the master determines that a person who requested a
40 hearing pursuant to subsection 2 has not complied with a
41 subpoena or warrant relating to a proceeding to determine the
42 paternity of a child or to establish or enforce an obligation for the
43 support of a child and the district court issues an order approving
44 the recommendation of the master, the district attorney or other
45 public agency may report the name of that person to the
-
*SB390_R1*
– 4 –
1 Department of Motor Vehicles, unless the suspension of the
2 driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person
3 would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
4 employment.
5 6. If the master determines that a person who requested a
6 hearing pursuant to subsection 2 is in arrears in the payment for
7 the support of one or more children, the master shall notify the
8 person that if the person does not immediately agree to enter into a
9 plan for the repayment of the arrearages that is approved by the
10 district attorney or other public agency, the driver’s license and
11 motorcycle driver’s license of the person may be subject to
12 suspension. If the person does not agree to enter into such a plan
13 and the district court issues an order approving the
14 recommendation of the master, the district attorney or other public
15 agency may report the name of that person to the Department of
16 Motor Vehicles, unless the suspension of the driver’s license and
17 motorcycle driver’s license of the person would be an impediment
18 to his or her present or potential employment.
19 7. The district attorney or other public agency shall, within 5
20 days after the person who has failed to comply with a subpoena or
21 warrant or is in arrears in the payment for the support of one or
22 more children complies with the subpoena or warrant or satisfies
23 the arrearage pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 9, notify the
24 Department of Motor Vehicles that the person has complied with
25 the subpoena or warrant or has satisfied the arrearage.
26 8. Each district attorney or other public agency collecting
27 support for children shall:
28 (a) Collect and maintain basic demographic data, including,
29 without limitation, data relating to household income, concerning
30 each person to whom the district attorney or other public agency
31 has sent a notice pursuant to subsection 1 and each person whose
32 name is reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to
33 subsection 2.
34 (b) On or before January 30 of each year, compile a report
35 summarizing the data collected and maintained by the district
36 attorney or other public agency during the immediately preceding
37 year pursuant to paragraph (a).

SENATE BILL NO. 390–SENATOR NEAL
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the support of
children. (BDR 38-85)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the support of children; revising the duties of
the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and
Supportive Services of the Department of Health
and Human Services; revising certain procedures and
requirements relating to the collection of support of
children; requiring the collecting and reporting of certain
demographic information; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each state to establish procedures under which the
2 state has the authority to withhold or suspend, or to restrict, the use of driver’s
3 licenses and professional, occupational and recreational licenses of a person who:
4 (1) has failed, after receiving notice, to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating
5 to paternity or child support proceedings; or (2) is in arrears in the payment of
6 support for one or more children. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Existing law requires the
7 district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children to report to
8 the Department of Motor Vehicles the name of a person who has, after receiving
9 notice, failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child
10 support proceedings or who is in arrears in the payment of support for one or more
11 children. (NRS 425.510) After receiving such a report, existing law requires the
12 Department to suspend the driver’s license and, if applicable, the motorcycle
13 driver’s license of the person. (NRS 483.443, 486.165)
14 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, rather than requires, the district attorney or
15 other public agency to provide such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
16 However, section 1 prohibits such a report from being made to the Department if
17 the suspension of the driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person
-
*SB390_R1*

– 2 –
18 named in the report would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
19 employment. Section 1 also provides that, for the purposes of issuing such a report
20 to the Department, a person is not in arrears in the payment of support for one or
21 more children unless the person: (1) is delinquent for not less than 3 months in
22 support payments or any payments ordered by a court for arrearages in such
23 payments; or (2) has failed to provide medical insurance for a child as required by a
24 court order. Section 1 also requires each district attorney or other public agency:
25 (1) to collect and maintain certain demographic data concerning persons who were
26 sent a notice concerning a subpoena, warrant or arrearage, and persons whose
27 names were reported to the Department; and (2) to annually submit a report to the
28 Legislature concerning such data. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change
29 to clarify the applicability of provisions governing when a person is in arrears for
30 the support of one or more children for the purposes of other provisions providing
31 for the suspension of professional, occupational and recreational licenses.
32 Under existing law, whenever a district attorney or other public agency
33 collecting support for children is required to make such a report to the Department
34 of Motor Vehicles, the district attorney or other public agency must also make such
35 a report the Department of Wildlife. (NRS 425.510) Existing law requires the
36 Department of Wildlife to suspend a license or permit to hunt, fish or trap issued to
37 the person named in the report, unless, within 30 days, the person provides certain
38 proof of compliance with the subpoena or warrant or satisfaction of the arrearage.
39 (NRS 502.115, 503.5835) Because section 1 changes the circumstances under
40 which the district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children
41 may make such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, section 4 of this bill
42 makes conforming changes to maintain the existing procedures currently in effect
43 for making such reports to the Department of Wildlife, thereby retaining: (1) the
44 requirement that the district attorney or public agency collecting support for
45 children make reports to the Department of Wildlife; and (2) the criteria under
46 existing law for determining when a person is in arrears in the payment of support
47 for one or more children for those purposes. (NRS 425.510, 425.560) Section 3 of
48 this bill establishes the applicability of definitions.
49 Existing federal law requires each state to develop a program for the purpose of
50 locating absent parents, establishing the paternity of children and establishing and
51 collecting payment obligations for the support of children. Existing federal law
52 makes certain federal funding and payments contingent on the performance of each
53 state in carrying out such a program. (42 U.S.C. §§ 651 et seq.) Existing law
54 provides that the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services
55 of the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for carrying out
56 and supervising the program of this State for those purposes. (NRS 425.365)
57 Section 2 of this bill requires the Administrator to make every effort to obtain the
58 approval necessary from the United States Department of Health and Human
59 Services to ensure that the program in this State complies with all the requirements
60 for the receipt of such federal funds.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
