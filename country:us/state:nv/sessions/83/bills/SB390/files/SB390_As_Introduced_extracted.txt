SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the support of
children. (BDR 38-85)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the support of children; revising the duties of
the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and
Supportive Services of the Department of Health
and Human Services; revising certain procedures and
requirements relating to the collection of support of
children; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each state to establish procedures under which the
2 state has the authority to withhold or suspend, or to restrict, the use of driver’s
3 licenses and professional, occupational and recreational licenses of a person who:
4 (1) has failed, after receiving notice, to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating
5 to paternity or child support proceedings; or (2) is in arrears in the payment of
6 support for one or more children. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Existing law requires the
7 district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children to report to
8 the Department of Motor Vehicles the name of a person who has, after receiving
9 notice, failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child
10 support proceedings or who is in arrears in the payment of support for one or more
11 children. (NRS 425.510) After receiving such a report, existing law requires the
12 Department to suspend the driver’s license and, if applicable, the motorcycle
13 driver’s license of the person. (NRS 483.443, 486.165)
14 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, rather than requires, the district attorney or
15 other public agency to provide such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
16 However, section 1 prohibits such a report from being made to the Department if
17 the suspension of the driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person
18 named in the report would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
19 employment. Section 1 also provides that, for the purposes of issuing such a report
20 to the Department, a person is not in arrears in the payment of support for one or
21 more children unless the person: (1) is delinquent for not less than 6 months in
22 support payments or any payments ordered by a court for arrearages in such
-
*SB390*
– 2 –
23 payments; or (2) has failed to provide medical insurance for a child as required by a
24 court order. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify the
25 applicability of provisions governing when a person is in arrears for the support of
26 one or more children for the purposes of other provisions providing for the
27 suspension of professional, occupational and recreational licenses.
28 Under existing law, whenever a district attorney or other public agency
29 collecting support for children is required to make such a report to the Department
30 of Motor Vehicles, the district attorney or other public agency must also make such
31 a report the Department of Wildlife. (NRS 425.510) Existing law requires the
32 Department of Wildlife to suspend a license or permit to hunt, fish or trap issued to
33 the person named in the report, unless, within 30 days, the person provides certain
34 proof of compliance with the subpoena or warrant or satisfaction of the arrearage.
35 (NRS 502.115, 503.5835) Because section 1 changes the circumstances under
36 which the district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children
37 may make such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, section 4 of this bill
38 makes conforming changes to maintain the existing procedures currently in effect
39 for making such reports to the Department of Wildlife, thereby retaining: (1) the
40 requirement that the district attorney or public agency collecting support for
41 children make reports to the Department of Wildlife; and (2) the criteria under
42 existing law for determining when a person is in arrears in the payment of support
43 for one or more children for those purposes. (NRS 425.510, 425.560) Section 3 of
44 this bill establishes the applicability of definitions.
45 Existing federal law requires each state to develop a program for the purpose of
46 locating absent parents, establishing the paternity of children and establishing and
47 collecting payment obligations for the support of children. Existing federal law
48 makes certain federal funding and payments contingent on the performance of each
49 state in carrying out such a program. (42 U.S.C. §§ 651 et seq.) Existing law
50 provides that the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services
51 of the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for carrying out
52 and supervising the program of this State for those purposes. (NRS 425.365)
53 Section 2 of this bill requires the Administrator to make every effort to obtain the
54 approval necessary from the United States Department of Health and Human
55 Services to ensure that the program in this State complies with all the requirements
56 for the receipt of such federal funds.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

28 establish or enforce an obligation for the support of a child, the
29 master shall include in the notice the information set forth in

38 support of a child and the district court issues an order approving
39 the recommendation of the master, the district attorney or other
40 public agency may report the name of that person to the
41 Department of Motor Vehicles, unless the suspension of the
42 driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person
43 would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
44 employment.

– 4 –
1 6. If the master determines that a person who requested a
2 hearing pursuant to subsection 2 is in arrears in the payment for
3 the support of one or more children, the master shall notify the
4 person that if the person does not immediately agree to enter into a
5 plan for the repayment of the arrearages that is approved by the
6 district attorney or other public agency, the driver’s license and
7 motorcycle driver’s license of the person may be subject to
8 suspension. If the person does not agree to enter into such a plan
9 and the district court issues an order approving the
10 recommendation of the master, the district attorney or other public
11 agency may report the name of that person to the Department of
12 Motor Vehicles, unless the suspension of the driver’s license and
13 motorcycle driver’s license of the person would be an impediment
14 to his or her present or potential employment.
15 7. The district attorney or other public agency shall, within 5
16 days after the person who has failed to comply with a subpoena or
17 warrant or is in arrears in the payment for the support of one or
18 more children complies with the subpoena or warrant or satisfies

S.B. 390
SENATE BILL NO. 390–SENATOR NEAL
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the support of
children. (BDR 38-85)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the support of children; revising the duties of
the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and
Supportive Services of the Department of Health
and Human Services; revising certain procedures and
requirements relating to the collection of support of
children; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each state to establish procedures under which the
2 state has the authority to withhold or suspend, or to restrict, the use of driver’s
3 licenses and professional, occupational and recreational licenses of a person who:
4 (1) has failed, after receiving notice, to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating
5 to paternity or child support proceedings; or (2) is in arrears in the payment of
6 support for one or more children. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Existing law requires the
7 district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children to report to
8 the Department of Motor Vehicles the name of a person who has, after receiving
9 notice, failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating to paternity or child
10 support proceedings or who is in arrears in the payment of support for one or more
11 children. (NRS 425.510) After receiving such a report, existing law requires the
12 Department to suspend the driver’s license and, if applicable, the motorcycle
13 driver’s license of the person. (NRS 483.443, 486.165)
14 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, rather than requires, the district attorney or
15 other public agency to provide such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
16 However, section 1 prohibits such a report from being made to the Department if
17 the suspension of the driver’s license and motorcycle driver’s license of the person
18 named in the report would be an impediment to his or her present or potential
19 employment. Section 1 also provides that, for the purposes of issuing such a report
20 to the Department, a person is not in arrears in the payment of support for one or
21 more children unless the person: (1) is delinquent for not less than 6 months in
22 support payments or any payments ordered by a court for arrearages in such
-
*SB390*

– 2 –
23 payments; or (2) has failed to provide medical insurance for a child as required by a
24 court order. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify the
25 applicability of provisions governing when a person is in arrears for the support of
26 one or more children for the purposes of other provisions providing for the
27 suspension of professional, occupational and recreational licenses.
28 Under existing law, whenever a district attorney or other public agency
29 collecting support for children is required to make such a report to the Department
30 of Motor Vehicles, the district attorney or other public agency must also make such
31 a report the Department of Wildlife. (NRS 425.510) Existing law requires the
32 Department of Wildlife to suspend a license or permit to hunt, fish or trap issued to
33 the person named in the report, unless, within 30 days, the person provides certain
34 proof of compliance with the subpoena or warrant or satisfaction of the arrearage.
35 (NRS 502.115, 503.5835) Because section 1 changes the circumstances under
36 which the district attorney or other public agency collecting support for children
37 may make such a report to the Department of Motor Vehicles, section 4 of this bill
38 makes conforming changes to maintain the existing procedures currently in effect
39 for making such reports to the Department of Wildlife, thereby retaining: (1) the
40 requirement that the district attorney or public agency collecting support for
41 children make reports to the Department of Wildlife; and (2) the criteria under
42 existing law for determining when a person is in arrears in the payment of support
43 for one or more children for those purposes. (NRS 425.510, 425.560) Section 3 of
44 this bill establishes the applicability of definitions.
45 Existing federal law requires each state to develop a program for the purpose of
46 locating absent parents, establishing the paternity of children and establishing and
47 collecting payment obligations for the support of children. Existing federal law
48 makes certain federal funding and payments contingent on the performance of each
49 state in carrying out such a program. (42 U.S.C. §§ 651 et seq.) Existing law
50 provides that the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services
51 of the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for carrying out
52 and supervising the program of this State for those purposes. (NRS 425.365)
53 Section 2 of this bill requires the Administrator to make every effort to obtain the
54 approval necessary from the United States Department of Health and Human
55 Services to ensure that the program in this State complies with all the requirements
56 for the receipt of such federal funds.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 425 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Each district attorney or other public agency collecting

5 person who:
6 (a) Has failed to comply with a subpoena or warrant relating
7 to a proceeding to determine the paternity of a child or to establish
8 or enforce an obligation for the support of a child; or
9 (b) Is in arrears in the payment for the support of one or more
10 children.

7 (b) Satisfy the arrearage pursuant to paragraph (b) of

9 (c) Submit to the district attorney or other public agency a

14 of the person would be an impediment to his or her present or
