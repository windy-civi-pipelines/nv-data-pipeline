EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional licensing; establishing procedures by which an
applicant for [a] certain professional or occupational [license] licenses
may obtain judicial review of the decision of a [licensing agency]
regulatory body denying the application of the applicant on the basis
of the moral character or criminal history of the applicant; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of certain professions and
2 occupations in this State. (Title 54 of NRS) Existing law, in general, designates various
3 state agencies, boards and commissions that are authorized to license and regulate those
4 professions and occupations as “regulatory bodies.” (NRS 622.060) Existing law
5 authorizes or requires various [entities that issue professional or occupational licenses]
6 regulatory bodies to deny an application for the issuance of [such] a professional or
7 occupational license based on the moral character or criminal history of the applicant. For
8 example, existing law authorizes the Nevada State Board of Accountancy to refuse to grant a
9 certificate of certified public accountant to an applicant if he or she has been convicted of a
10 felony in this State. (NRS 628.190) Similarly, existing law requires an applicant for a license
11 as an athletic trainer to be of good moral character. (NRS 640B.310) [Additionally, under
12 existing law, the Cannabis Compliance Board is prohibited, with certain exceptions, from
13 issuing a cannabis establishment agent registration card to a person who has been convicted of
14 certain felony offenses. (NRS 678B.340)] This bill sets forth procedures by which an
15 applicant for the issuance of [any] a “license,” which existing law defines to mean any
16 license, [certification,] certificate, registration, permit or other similar type of authorization
17 [that grants a person the authority to engage in a profession or occupation in this State that is]
18 issued by [any officer, agency, board or commission of this State or any political subdivision
19 of this State] a regulatory body, may obtain judicial review of a final decision of the
20 regulatory body denying the application of the applicant on the basis of the moral character
21 or criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 622.030)
22 This bill requires a [licensing agency] regulatory body that denies an application for the
23 issuance of a license on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of the applicant to
24 , before issuing a final decision on the matter, advise the applicant of the administrative
25 remedies available for challenging the denial, if any, and the applicable timelines for
26 pursuing such remedies. If the regulatory body issues a final decision denying the
27 application of the applicant on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of the
Assembly Amendment No. 128 to Assembly Bill No. 264 Page 4
28 applicant, this bill requires the regulatory body to provide written notice to the applicant
29 within 10 days after the [denial.] issuance of the final decision. This bill authorizes the
30 applicant to file a petition in the district court seeking review of the decision within 30 days
31 after receipt of the notice. Under this bill, the [licensing agency] regulatory body is required
32 to prove by [clear and convincing] a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing on the
33 petition that the issuance of the license to the applicant would pose a direct, substantial and
34 unmitigatable risk to public health or safety based on the duties and responsibilities of the
35 profession or occupation in which the applicant wishes to engage. If the court determines that
36 the [licensing agency] regulatory body has met that burden of proof, this bill requires the
37 court to issue an order affirming the decision of the [licensing agency.] regulatory body. If
38 the court determines that the [licensing agency] regulatory body has not met that burden of
39 proof, this bill requires the court to order the [licensing agency] regulatory body to issue the
40 applicant the license. Under this bill, the [licensing agency] regulatory body is required to
41 comply with the order, notwithstanding any other provision of existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter [237] 622 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a
2 new section to read as follows:
3 1. If a [licensing agency] regulatory body denies an application for the
4 issuance of a license on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of
5 the applicant, the [licensing agency] regulatory body shall , before issuing a final
6 decision on the matter, advise the applicant of the administrative remedies
7 available for challenging the denial, if any, and the applicable timelines for
8 pursuing such remedies. The regulatory body shall, within 10 days after issuing a
9 final decision denying the application of the applicant on the basis of the moral
10 character or criminal history of the applicant, provide to the applicant written
11 notice [within 10 days after the denial.] of the final decision. The notice must set
12 forth the basis for the final decision of the [licensing agency and contain an
13 explanation of the provisions of this section.] regulatory body.
14 2. An applicant who receives a notice of a final decision provided pursuant
15 to subsection 1 may, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, file a petition in the
16 district court seeking review of the decision of the [licensing agency.] regulatory
17 body.
18 3. Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to subsection 2, the court shall set
19 a time for a hearing on the petition and provide notice of the hearing to the
20 applicant and [licensing agency.] regulatory body. At the hearing, the [licensing
21 agency] regulatory body has the burden of proof of establishing by [clear and
22 convincing] a preponderance of the evidence that the issuance to the applicant of
23 the license for which the applicant applied would pose a direct, substantial and
24 unmitigatable risk to public health or safety based on the duties and
25 responsibilities of the profession or occupation in which the applicant wishes to
26 engage. The regulatory body may present the court with any relevant evidence
27 showing how it reached its decision on the matter. Evidence of any prior arrests
28 of the applicant is not sufficient in itself to meet the burden of proof imposed on
29 the regulatory body pursuant to this subsection.
30 4. If the court determines that the licensing agency has met the burden of
31 proof required by subsection 3, the court shall issue an order affirming the
32 decision of the [licensing agency.] regulatory body. The order must contain
33 specific findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the decision of the
34 court . [and specific recommendations to improve the possibility of being granted
35 the license the next time the applicant applies for the license.] The court may also

1 order the regulatory body to meet and confer with the applicant concerning any
2 necessary actions that the applicant must take for the regulatory body to not deny
3 the applicant a license based on the moral character or criminal history of the
4 applicant.
5 5. If the court determines that the [licensing agency] regulatory body has
6 failed to meet the burden of proof required by subsection 3, the court shall issue
7 an order requiring the [licensing agency] regulatory body to issue the license to
8 the applicant. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the [licensing agency]
9 regulatory body shall comply with the order and issue the license to the applicant.
10 6. The provisions of this section do not apply to an applicant for the
11 issuance of a license issued by the State Contractors’ Board pursuant to chapter
12 624 of NRS.
13 7. As used in this section [:
14 (a) “License”] , “applicant” means a natural person who applies for a
15 license . [, certification, registration, permit or other authorization that grants a
16 person the authority to engage in a profession or occupation in this State.
17 (b) “Licensing agency” means any officer, agency, board or commission of
18 this State or any political subdivision of this State that issues a license.]
