SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the issuance of certain
professional and occupational licenses.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional licensing; establishing procedures
by which an applicant for certain professional or
occupational licenses may obtain judicial review of the
decision of a regulatory body denying the application of
the applicant on the basis of the moral character or
criminal history of the applicant; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of certain professions and
2 occupations in this State. (Title 54 of NRS) Existing law, in general, designates
3 various state agencies, boards and commissions that are authorized to license and
4 regulate those professions and occupations as “regulatory bodies.” (NRS 622.060)
5 Existing law authorizes or requires various regulatory bodies to deny an application
6 for the issuance of a professional or occupational license based on the moral
7 character or criminal history of the applicant. For example, existing law authorizes
8 the Nevada State Board of Accountancy to refuse to grant a certificate of certified
9 public accountant to an applicant if he or she has been convicted of a felony in this
10 State. (NRS 628.190) Similarly, existing law requires an applicant for a license as
11 an athletic trainer to be of good moral character. (NRS 640B.310) This bill sets
12 forth procedures by which an applicant for the issuance of a “license,” which
13 existing law defines to mean any license, certificate, registration, permit or other
14 similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body, may obtain judicial
15 review of a final decision of the regulatory body denying the application of the
16 applicant on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of the applicant.
17 (NRS 622.030)
18 This bill requires a regulatory body that denies an application for the issuance
19 of a license on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of the applicant
20 to, before issuing a final decision on the matter, advise the applicant of the
-

– 2 –
21 administrative remedies available for challenging the denial, if any, and the
22 applicable timelines for pursuing such remedies. If the regulatory body issues a
23 final decision denying the application of the applicant on the basis of the moral
24 character or criminal history of the applicant, this bill requires the regulatory body
25 to provide written notice to the applicant within 10 days after the issuance of the
26 final decision. This bill authorizes the applicant to file a petition in the district court
27 seeking review of the decision within 30 days after receipt of the notice. Under this
28 bill, the regulatory body is required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence at
29 the hearing on the petition that the issuance of the license to the applicant would
30 pose a direct, substantial and unmitigatable risk to public health or safety based on
31 the duties and responsibilities of the profession or occupation in which the
32 applicant wishes to engage. If the court determines that the regulatory body has met
33 that burden of proof, this bill requires the court to issue an order affirming the
34 decision of the regulatory body. If the court determines that the regulatory body has
35 not met that burden of proof, this bill requires the court to order the regulatory body
36 to issue the applicant the license. Under this bill, the regulatory body is required to
37 comply with the order, notwithstanding any other provision of existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 622 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. If a regulatory body denies an application for the issuance
4 of a license on the basis of the moral character or criminal history
5 of the applicant, the regulatory body shall, before issuing a final
6 decision on the matter, advise the applicant of the administrative
7 remedies available for challenging the denial, if any, and the
8 applicable timelines for pursuing such remedies. The regulatory
9 body shall, within 10 days after issuing a final decision denying
10 the application of the applicant on the basis of the moral character
11 or criminal history of the applicant, provide to the applicant
12 written notice of the final decision. The notice must set forth the
13 basis for the final decision of the regulatory body.
14 2. An applicant who receives a notice of a final decision
15 provided pursuant to subsection 1 may, within 30 days after
16 receipt of the notice, file a petition in the district court seeking
17 review of the decision of the regulatory body.
18 3. Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to subsection 2, the
19 court shall set a time for a hearing on the petition and provide
20 notice of the hearing to the applicant and regulatory body. At the
21 hearing, the regulatory body has the burden of proof of
22 establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the issuance
23 to the applicant of the license for which the applicant applied
24 would pose a direct, substantial and unmitigatable risk to public
25 health or safety based on the duties and responsibilities of the
26 profession or occupation in which the applicant wishes to engage.

1 The regulatory body may present the court with any relevant
2 evidence showing how it reached its decision on the matter.
3 Evidence of any prior arrests of the applicant is not sufficient in
4 itself to meet the burden of proof imposed on the regulatory body
5 pursuant to this subsection.
6 4. If the court determines that the licensing agency has met
7 the burden of proof required by subsection 3, the court shall issue
8 an order affirming the decision of the regulatory body. The order
9 must contain specific findings of fact and conclusions of law
10 supporting the decision of the court. The court may also order the
11 regulatory body to meet and confer with the applicant concerning
12 any necessary actions that the applicant must take for the
13 regulatory body to not deny the applicant a license based on the
14 moral character or criminal history of the applicant.
15 5. If the court determines that the regulatory body has failed
16 to meet the burden of proof required by subsection 3, the court
17 shall issue an order requiring the regulatory body to issue the
18 license to the applicant. Notwithstanding any other provision of
19 law, the regulatory body shall comply with the order and issue the
20 license to the applicant.
21 6. The provisions of this section do not apply to an applicant
22 for the issuance of a license issued by the State Contractors’
23 Board pursuant to chapter 624 of NRS.
24 7. As used in this section, “applicant” means a natural
25 person who applies for a license.
