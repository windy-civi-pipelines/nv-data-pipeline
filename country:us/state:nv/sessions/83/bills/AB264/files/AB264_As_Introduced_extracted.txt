EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional licensing; establishing procedures
by which an applicant for a professional or occupational
license may obtain judicial review of the decision of a
licensing agency denying the application of the applicant
on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of
the applicant; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes or requires various entities that issue professional or
2 occupational licenses to deny an application for the issuance of such a license based
3 on the moral character or criminal history of the applicant. For example, existing
4 law authorizes the Nevada State Board of Accountancy to refuse to grant a
5 certificate of certified public accountant to an applicant if he or she has been
6 convicted of a felony in this State. (NRS 628.190) Similarly, existing law requires
7 an applicant for a license as an athletic trainer to be of good moral character. (NRS
8 640B.310) Additionally, under existing law, the Cannabis Compliance Board is
9 prohibited, with certain exceptions, from issuing a cannabis establishment agent
10 registration card to a person who has been convicted of certain felony offenses.
11 (NRS 678B.340) This bill sets forth procedures by which an applicant for the
12 issuance of any license, certification, registration, permit or other authorization that
13 grants a person the authority to engage in a profession or occupation in this State
14 that is issued by any officer, agency, board or commission of this State or any
15 political subdivision of this State may obtain judicial review of a decision denying
16 the application of the applicant on the basis of the moral character or criminal
17 history of the applicant.
18 This bill requires a licensing agency that denies an application for the issuance
19 of a license on the basis of the moral character or criminal history of the applicant
20 to provide written notice to the applicant within 10 days after the denial. This bill
-

– 2 –
21 authorizes the applicant to file a petition in the district court seeking review of the
22 decision within 30 days after receipt of the notice. Under this bill, the licensing
23 agency is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence at the hearing on the
24 petition that the issuance of the license to the applicant would pose a direct,
25 substantial and unmitigatable risk to public health or safety based on the duties and
26 responsibilities of the profession or occupation in which the applicant wishes to
27 engage. If the court determines that the licensing agency has met that burden of
28 proof, this bill requires the court to issue an order affirming the decision of the
29 licensing agency. If the court determines that the licensing agency has not met that
30 burden of proof, this bill requires the court to order the licensing agency to issue the
31 applicant the license. Under this bill, the licensing agency is required to comply
32 with the order, notwithstanding any other provision of existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 237 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. If a licensing agency denies an application for the issuance
4 of a license on the basis of the moral character or criminal history
5 of the applicant, the licensing agency shall provide to the
6 applicant written notice within 10 days after the denial. The notice
7 must set forth the basis for the decision of the licensing agency
8 and contain an explanation of the provisions of this section.
9 2. An applicant who receives a notice provided pursuant to
10 subsection 1 may, within 30 days after receipt of the notice, file a
11 petition in the district court seeking review of the decision of the
12 licensing agency.
13 3. Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to subsection 2, the
14 court shall set a time for a hearing on the petition and provide
15 notice of the hearing to the applicant and licensing agency. At the
16 hearing, the licensing agency has the burden of proof of
17 establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the issuance to
18 the applicant of the license for which the applicant applied would
19 pose a direct, substantial and unmitigatable risk to public health
20 or safety based on the duties and responsibilities of the profession
21 or occupation in which the applicant wishes to engage.
22 4. If the court determines that the licensing agency has met
23 the burden of proof required by subsection 3, the court shall issue
24 an order affirming the decision of the licensing agency. The order
25 must contain specific findings of fact and conclusions of law
26 supporting the decision of the court and specific recommendations
27 to improve the possibility of being granted the license the next time
28 the applicant applies for the license.
29 5. If the court determines that the licensing agency has failed
30 to meet the burden of proof required by subsection 3, the court

1 shall issue an order requiring the licensing agency to issue the
2 license to the applicant. Notwithstanding any other provision of
3 law, the licensing agency shall comply with the order and issue the
4 license to the applicant.

6 (a) “License” means a license, certification, registration,
7 permit or other authorization that grants a person the authority to
8 engage in a profession or occupation in this State.
