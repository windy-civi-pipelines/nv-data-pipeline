Assembly Bill No. 334–Assemblymembers
Kasama, Yurek; Hardy and Koenig
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; revising provisions governing the
qualifications of applicants for a license by endorsement as a
dental hygienist; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of dental hygienists and
expanded function dental assistants in this State by the Board of Dental Examiners
of Nevada. (Chapter 631 of NRS) Existing law further: (1) requires a regulatory
body to adopt regulations providing for the issuance of a license by endorsement to
engage in an occupation or profession in this State to a natural person who is
licensed to practice that profession in another state; and (2) sets forth certain
minimum requirements for obtaining a license by endorsement. Existing law
authorizes a regulatory body to require an applicant for such a license by
endorsement to submit proof that the applicant has engaged in the occupation or
profession for which the applicant is seeking a license by endorsement for a period
of time specified by the regulatory body. (NRS 622.530)
Under existing regulations, a person applying for licensure by endorsement as a
dental hygienist, in addition to certain other requirements, is required to have
actively practiced dental hygiene for the 5 years immediately preceding the date of
submission of the application. (NAC 631.030) Section 4 of this bill declares this
provision of regulation void, and sections 1 and 2 of this bill prohibit the Board
from adopting regulations that require an applicant for licensure by endorsement to
practice dental hygiene to have practiced dental hygiene in another state for a
specified period of time immediately preceding submission of the application for
licensure by endorsement. Thus, sections 1, 2 and 4 have the effect of removing
the requirement that an applicant for licensure by endorsement to practice dental
hygiene have practiced in another state for 5 years immediately preceding the date
of submission of an application for such licensure.
