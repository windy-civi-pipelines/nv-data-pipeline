SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to oral health. (BDR 54-800)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; revising provisions governing the qualifications of
applicants for a license by endorsement as a dental hygienist; [revising
the scope of practice of expanded function dental assistants and dental
hygienists who have a special endorsement to practice restorative
dental hygiene;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of dental hygienists and expanded
2 function dental assistants in this State by the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada. (Chapter
3 631 of NRS) Existing law further: (1) requires a regulatory body to adopt regulations
4 providing for the issuance of a license by endorsement to engage in an occupation or
5 profession in this State to a natural person who is licensed to practice that profession in
6 another state; and (2) sets forth certain minimum requirements for obtaining a license by
7 endorsement. Existing law authorizes a regulatory body to require an applicant for such a
8 license by endorsement to submit proof that the applicant has engaged in the occupation or
9 profession for which the applicant is seeking a license by endorsement for a period of time
10 specified by the regulatory body. (NRS 622.530)
11 Under existing regulations, a person applying for licensure by endorsement as a dental
12 hygienist, in addition to certain other requirements, is required to have actively practiced
13 dental hygiene for the 5 years immediately preceding the date of submission of the
14 application. (NAC 631.030) Section 4 of this bill declares this provision of regulation void,
15 and sections 1 and 2 of this bill prohibit the Board from adopting regulations that require an
16 applicant for licensure by endorsement to practice dental hygiene to have practiced dental
17 hygiene in another state for a specified period of time immediately preceding submission of
18 the application for licensure by endorsement. Thus, sections 1, 2 and 4 have the effect of
19 removing the requirement that an applicant for licensure by endorsement to practice dental
20 hygiene have practiced in another state for 5 years immediately preceding the date of
21 submission of an application for such licensure.
22 [Existing law authorizes an expanded function dental assistant or dental hygienist with a
23 special endorsement to practice restorative dental hygiene to use an ultrasonic scaling unit
24 only for the removal of bonding agents. (NRS 631.3129) Section 3 of this bill removes the
25 limitation on the use of an ultrasonic scaling unit by an expanded function dental assistant or
26 dental hygienist with a special endorsement to practice restorative dental hygiene, thereby
27 authorizing such a person to use an ultrasonic scaling unit without limitation. Section 3 also
28 authorizes such a person to perform coronal scaling.]

1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of dental hygienists and expanded

6 another state; and (2) sets forth certain minimum requirements for obtaining a license by
