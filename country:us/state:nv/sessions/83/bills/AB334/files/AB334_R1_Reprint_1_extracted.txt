SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to oral health.
(BDR 54-800)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; revising provisions governing the
qualifications of applicants for a license by endorsement
as a dental hygienist; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of dental hygienists and
2 expanded function dental assistants in this State by the Board of Dental Examiners
3 of Nevada. (Chapter 631 of NRS) Existing law further: (1) requires a regulatory
4 body to adopt regulations providing for the issuance of a license by endorsement to
5 engage in an occupation or profession in this State to a natural person who is
6 licensed to practice that profession in another state; and (2) sets forth certain
7 minimum requirements for obtaining a license by endorsement. Existing law
8 authorizes a regulatory body to require an applicant for such a license by
9 endorsement to submit proof that the applicant has engaged in the occupation or
10 profession for which the applicant is seeking a license by endorsement for a period
11 of time specified by the regulatory body. (NRS 622.530)
12 Under existing regulations, a person applying for licensure by endorsement as a
13 dental hygienist, in addition to certain other requirements, is required to have
14 actively practiced dental hygiene for the 5 years immediately preceding the date of
15 submission of the application. (NAC 631.030) Section 4 of this bill declares this
16 provision of regulation void, and sections 1 and 2 of this bill prohibit the Board
17 from adopting regulations that require an applicant for licensure by endorsement to
18 practice dental hygiene to have practiced dental hygiene in another state for a
19 specified period of time immediately preceding submission of the application for
20 licensure by endorsement. Thus, sections 1, 2 and 4 have the effect of removing
21 the requirement that an applicant for licensure by endorsement to practice dental
22 hygiene have practiced in another state for 5 years immediately preceding the date
23 of submission of an application for such licensure.

37 applicant not later than:
