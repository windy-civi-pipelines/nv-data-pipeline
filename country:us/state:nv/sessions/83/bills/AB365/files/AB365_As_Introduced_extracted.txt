32 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
33 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
34 information that is not otherwise confidential.
35 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
36 has legal custody or control of a public record:

40 medium.
41 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
42 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
