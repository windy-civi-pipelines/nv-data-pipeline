ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to revise provisions relating to the assessment and
taxation of real property which is sold or transferred . [and to require
the Legislature to enact a program to provide property tax assistance to
senior citizens and persons with disabilities.]
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution requires the Legislature to provide by law for a uniform and
2 equal rate of assessment and taxation of property. (Nev. Const. Art. 10, § 1)
3 Under existing law, for the purpose of determining the amount of property tax owed by
4 the owner of a parcel of real property, the taxable value of the real property is equal to the
5 value of the land plus the replacement cost of the improvements less all applicable
6 depreciation and obsolescence. Depreciation of an improvement is calculated at 1.5 percent
7 for each year of adjusted actual age, up to a maximum of 50 years. (NRS 361.227) Existing
8 law also provides for a partial abatement of property taxes, which has the effect of
9 establishing an annual cap on increases in property taxes. (NRS 361.4722, 361.4723,
10 361.4724) This resolution proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to provide that: (1) for
11 the first fiscal year after real property is sold or transferred, the real property is ineligible for
12 any adjustment to the value of improvements on the real property which is based on the age of
13 the improvement and certain partial abatements; and (2) for any fiscal year thereafter, any
14 adjustment to the value of improvements on the real property which is based on the age of the
15 improvements must be determined as if the improvements were new improvements on the
16 date of the sale or transfer.
17 [This resolution also proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to require the
18 Legislature to provide by law for a program to provide assistance to persons domiciled in this
19 State who are 62 years of age or older or persons with a disability by paying such persons
20 refunds of the property taxes imposed on the primary residences of such persons.]
Assembly Amendment No. 371 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 1 Page 4

2 That Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution be amended to read as
3 follows:
4 Section 1. 1. The Legislature shall provide by law for a uniform
5 and equal rate of assessment and taxation, and shall prescribe such
6 regulations as shall secure a just valuation for taxation of all property, real,
7 personal and possessory, except mines and mining claims, which shall be
8 assessed and taxed only as provided in Section 5 of this Article.
9 2. Shares of stock, bonds, mortgages, notes, bank deposits, book
10 accounts and credits, and securities and choses in action of like character
11 are deemed to represent interest in property already assessed and taxed,
12 either in Nevada or elsewhere, and shall be exempt.
13 3. The Legislature may constitute agricultural and open-space real
14 property having a greater value for another use than that for which it is
15 being used, as a separate class for taxation purposes and may provide a
16 separate uniform plan for appraisal and valuation of such property for
17 assessment purposes. If such plan is provided, the Legislature shall also
18 provide for retroactive assessment for a period of not less than 7 years when
19 agricultural and open-space real property is converted to a higher use
20 conforming to the use for which other nearby property is used.
21 4. Personal property which is moving in interstate commerce through
22 or over the territory of the State of Nevada, or which was consigned to a
23 warehouse, public or private, within the State of Nevada from outside the
24 State of Nevada for storage in transit to a final destination outside the State
25 of Nevada, whether specified when transportation begins or afterward, shall
26 be deemed to have acquired no situs in Nevada for purposes of taxation and
27 shall be exempt from taxation. Such property shall not be deprived of such
28 exemption because while in the warehouse the property is assembled,
29 bound, joined, processed, disassembled, divided, cut, broken in bulk,
30 relabeled or repackaged.
31 5. The Legislature may exempt motor vehicles from the provisions of
32 the tax required by this Section, and in lieu thereof, if such exemption is
33 granted, shall provide for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and
34 taxation of motor vehicles, which rate shall not exceed five cents on one
35 dollar of assessed valuation.
36 6. The Legislature shall provide by law for a progressive reduction in
37 the tax upon business inventories by 20 percent in each year following the
38 adoption of this provision, and after the expiration of the 4th year such
39 inventories are exempt from taxation. The Legislature may exempt any
40 other personal property, including livestock.
41 7. No inheritance tax shall ever be levied.
42 8. The Legislature may exempt by law property used for municipal,
43 educational, literary, scientific or other charitable purposes, or to encourage
44 the conservation of energy or the substitution of other sources for fossil
45 sources of energy.
46 9. No income tax shall be levied upon the wages or personal income
47 of natural persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, and except as
48 otherwise provided in subsection 1 of this Section, taxes may be levied
49 upon the income or revenue of any business in whatever form it may be
50 conducted for profit in the State.
51 10. The Legislature may provide by law for an abatement of the tax
52 upon or an exemption of part of the assessed value of a single-family
Assembly Amendment No. 371 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 1 Page 5
1 residence occupied by the owner to the extent necessary to avoid severe
2 economic hardship to the owner of the residence.
3 11. For purposes of assessment and taxation of property:
4 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, for the first fiscal
5 year after the sale or transfer of real property, the real property sold or
6 transferred shall not be eligible for any adjustment provided by the
7 Legislature by law based on the age of improvements to the real property,
8 any abatement of the tax upon the real property provided by the
9 Legislature by law pursuant to subsection 8 or any abatement or
10 exemption provided by the Legislature by law pursuant to subsection 10.
11 The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to real property for which
12 the Legislature has provided by law for an exemption of the tax on
13 property.
14 (b) For any fiscal year following the first fiscal year after the sale or
15 transfer of real property to which the provisions of paragraph (a) apply,
16 any adjustment provided by the Legislature by law based on the age of
17 improvements to the real property must be determined as if the
18 improvements were new improvements on the date of the sale or transfer.
19 (c) The Legislature shall provide by law for definitions of the terms
20 “sale” and “transfer” as necessary to carry out the provisions of this
21 subsection.
22 [12. The Legislature shall provide by law for a program to provide
23 for the payment of refunds of the taxes imposed on the primary residence
24 of a person domiciled in this State who is 62 years of age or older or a
25 person with a disability. If such a person rents his or her primary
26 residence, the amount of the refund for which the person is eligible must
27 not exceed the portion of the rent which is deemed to constitute accrued
28 property tax. The Legislature shall establish by law:
29 (a) The criteria which a person must satisfy to be eligible for such a
30 refund; and
31 (b) The amount of the refund to be paid to a person eligible for such
32 a refund, which may consist of a graduated refund based on the
33 household income of such a person.]
34 And be it further
35 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage.
