Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in
2 this State and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS
3 679B.120) Existing law sets forth various requirements relating to examinations of
4 insurers, which are conducted by the Commissioner. (NRS 679B.230-679B.300)
5 Section 354 of this bill repeals those provisions of existing law relating to
6 examinations of insurers. Sections 1-41 of this bill reenact, reorganize and revise
7 those provisions into a new chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes governing
8 examinations of insurers and other persons subject to regulation under the Nevada
9 Insurance Code. Sections 3-12 and 27-41 additionally enact provisions that are
10 modeled, in general, after the Market Conduct Surveillance Model Law adopted by
11 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and which: (1) require the
12 Commissioner to collect and analyze information concerning the market practices
13 of insurers; and (2) authorize the Commissioner to take certain actions, including,
14 without limitation, the conducting of certain examinations, based on the results of
15 that analysis. Sections 43, 54, 65, 111, 113, 114, 124-127, 197, 203, 210, 213, 216-
16 218, 221, 223, 229, 251, 253, 269, 289-291, 293, 294, 297, 318, 319, 336, 340 and
17 342 of this bill make conforming changes to replace references in existing law to
18 the sections which were repealed and reenacted in sections 2-41.
19 Section 42 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner, during a state of
20 emergency or declaration of disaster, to issue a temporary order to address certain
21 matters relating to policies issued in this State. Section 42 requires each such order
22 to be approved by the Governor and meet certain other requirements. Section 333
23 of this bill exempts any order issued by the Commissioner pursuant to section 42
24 from the requirements of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
25 (NRS 233B.039)
26 Section 44 of this bill expands the applicability of a provision of existing law
27 requiring the Secretary of State to nullify the charter or certificate of certain
28 insurers who are prohibited from transacting insurance in this State to include any
29 person who is prohibited from transacting insurance in this State. Section 45 of this
30 bill revises requirements imposed on the Commissioner concerning the publication
31 of a guide to rates for policies of insurance for motor vehicles. Section 46 of this
32 bill revises provisions governing oversight by the Commissioner of certain usual
33 and customary fees or reimbursement methodologies. Section 47 of this bill
34 authorizes an attorney employed by the Division of Insurance of the Department of
35 Business and Industry to act as legal counsel to the Division and the Commissioner
36 in certain matters, instead of the Attorney General. Section 48 of this bill: (1)
37 authorizes the Commissioner to enter into contracts with the National Association
38 of Insurance Commissioners for goods and services related to the regulation of
39 insurance; and (2) exempts such a contract from the provisions of existing law
40 governing purchasing for the State. Section 116 of this bill makes a conforming
41 change to update an internal reference changed by section 48. Section 51 of this
42 bill authorizes the Commissioner to limit, in addition to suspending, the certificate
43 of authority of an insurer under certain circumstances.
44 Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of administrators by
45 the Commissioner. (NRS 683A.0805-683A.0893) Section 55 of this bill requires an
46 administrator to report to the Commissioner certain information concerning
47 administrative actions and criminal prosecutions against the administrator. Section
48 57 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to administrators to
49 section 55. Sections 58-60 of this bill revise provisions relating to certain: (1)
50 documents which are required as part of an application for registration as an
51 administrator; (2) bonds which are required to be filed by an administrator; and (3)
52 recordkeeping requirements for administrators. Section 61 of this bill authorizes an
53 administrator to use accounts in a financial institution not located in this State to
54 hold certain money in a fiduciary capacity. Section 62 of this bill authorizes the
-
*AB74*

– 3 –
55 Commissioner to revoke the registration of an administrator without further notice
56 if the registration has already been suspended and the administrator becomes
57 nonresponsive.
58 Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of providers of service
59 contracts by the Commissioner. (Chapter 690C of NRS) Sections 52 and 205 of
60 this bill: (1) reduce from 2 years to 1 year the length of time that a certificate of
61 registration for a service contract provider is valid; and (2) proportionally reduce
62 the fees for registration and renewal to reflect annual instead of biennial
63 registration. Sections 202, 207 and 209 of this bill revise provisions relating to
64 certain duties and requirements for the registration of a service contract provider.
65 Section 206 of this bill revises provisions relating to the financial security which is
66 required of a service contract provider. Section 208 of this bill requires a service
67 contract to include the name of the holder of the service contract. Sections 56, 199,
68 201 and 204 of this bill: (1) require a person who administers a service contract to
69 obtain a certificate of registration as an administrator issued by the Commissioner;
70 (2) subject such an administrator to the provisions of existing law governing
71 administrators; and (3) set forth certain requirements for the operation of such an
72 administrator. Sections 200 and 211 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to: (1)
73 issue a cease and desist order under certain circumstances; and (2) suspend, without
74 advance notice or a hearing, the registration of a service contract provider if the
75 provider violates a cease and desist order from the Commissioner. Section 212 of
76 this bill increases the maximum fines the Commissioner may assess for certain
77 violations of existing law relating to service contracts.
78 Section 64 of this bill: (1) removes a provision requiring certain hearings to be
79 held within 30 days of a written application under certain circumstances, thus
80 making existing law applicable which provides a 60-day timeline for such hearings
81 under those circumstances; and (2) authorizes the Commissioner, after notice and
82 the opportunity for a hearing, to take certain actions against the license of a
83 business organization. (NRS 679B.310)
84 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of independent adjusters,
85 public adjusters, company adjusters and staff adjusters by the Commissioner.
86 (Chapter 684A of NRS) Section 67 of this bill eliminates the staff adjuster and
87 company adjuster license types and instead consolidates those license types into the
88 independent adjuster license type. Sections 66, 68-70, 73-76, 343 and 344 of this
89 bill make conforming changes to reflect that consolidation.
90 Existing law generally exempts a person who is licensed as an adjuster in
91 another state from the requirement to take and pass an examination to obtain a
92 nonresident license as an adjuster under certain circumstances. Sections 71 and 72
93 of this bill require a person to take and pass such an examination if the home state
94 of the person requires a nonresident applicant for a license as an adjuster to take
95 and pass an examination for licensure.
96 Section 77 of this bill revises requirements for licensing as a surplus lines
97 broker. Section 78 of this bill revises provisions relating to the Commissioner
98 accepting service of process on behalf of unauthorized insurers in certain
99 circumstances.
100 Existing law governs trade practices and frauds relating to the insurance
101 business and gives the Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to regulate trade
102 practices in the insurance business. (Chapter 686A of NRS) Sections 80-83, 97, 99,
103 101, 102 and 110 of this bill revise and add to the provisions of existing law
104 governing trade practices and frauds for the purpose of conforming more closely to
105 the Unfair Trade Practices Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance
106 Commissioners. Section 80 prohibits an insurer from taking certain discriminatory
107 actions. Section 81 imposes certain requirements on an insurer relating to
108 recordkeeping. Section 82 prohibits a person from making certain false or
109 fraudulent statements or representations. Section 83 requires a property and
-
*AB74*

– 4 –
110 casualty insurer to provide to a primary insured certain loss information upon
111 request. Section 97 prohibits an insurer from providing certain inducements to
112 purchase insurance. Section 99 sets forth certain restrictions upon a person, bank or
113 affiliate relating to insurance. Section 101 sets forth certain actions relating to
114 value-added products or services that do not constitute prohibited discrimination or
115 rebates. Section 102 sets forth certain actions that constitute prohibited unfair
116 discrimination. Section 110 sets forth certain recordkeeping requirements for a
117 person who generates leads for an insurer or producer of insurance relating to
118 health insurance products and services.
119 Existing law prohibits certain health insurers from denying a claim, refusing to
120 issue or cancelling a policy of health insurance solely because the claim involves an
121 act of domestic violence or the person applying for or covered by the policy was the
122 victim of such an act of domestic violence. (NRS 689A.413, 689B.068, 689C.196,
123 695A.195, 695B.316, 695C.203, 695D.217) Section 354 repeals those provisions.
124 Sections 84-93 of this bill instead set forth restrictions concerning discrimination
125 based on domestic violence which are modeled, in general, after several model acts
126 adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to unfair
127 discrimination against subjects of abuse. Sections 83-92 prohibit insurers,
128 insurance professionals and other persons from engaging in various discriminatory
129 actions relating to domestic violence, including, among other actions: (1) denying,
130 refusing to issue or renew, cancelling or otherwise terminating a policy of insurance
131 on the basis of the domestic violence status of a person; and (2) with certain
132 exceptions, denying benefits on a policy of insurance on the basis of domestic
133 violence status, including, without limitation, denying a claim under a policy of
134 health insurance solely because the claim involves an act that constitutes domestic
135 violence. Section 93 requires an insurer or insurance professional to explain to an
136 applicant or insured, and demonstrate to the Commissioner, certain matters relating
137 to certain actions involving medical conditions relating to domestic violence.
138 Section 109 of this bill sets forth certain unfair trade practices relating to the
139 handling of claims that are modeled, in general, after provisions set forth in the
140 Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act adopted by the National Association of
141 Insurance Commissioners.
142 Section 115 of this bill limits deductions for depreciation in the settlement of
143 certain property insurance claims to the cost of physical goods being repaired or
144 replaced.
145 Section 117 of this bill reduces the time within which an insurer is required to
146 respond to a request for prior authorization, from within 20 days after the insurer
147 received the request to: (1) within 2 business days after the date of submission of
148 the request, if the request involves urgent health care services; and (2) within 5
149 business days after the date of submission of the request, if the request does not
150 involve urgent health care services.
151 Existing law prohibits an insurer from taking certain adverse actions against a
152 policy of motor vehicle insurance as a result of the filing of certain claims or the
153 making of certain inquiries. (NRS 687B.385) Section 118 of this bill expands that
154 prohibition to prohibit an insurer from taking certain adverse actions against a
155 policy of property or casualty insurance as a result of the filing of certain claims or
156 the making of certain inquiries.
157 Section 119 of this bill revises the dates on which the Commissioner is required
158 to request and an insurer is required to provide certain annual information relating
159 to compliance with certain federal laws.
160 Sections 128-134, 153-159, 175-181, 197, 232-237, 252, 270, 298-302, 304
161 and 305 of this bill reorganize and revise, for consistency throughout various
162 provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code, certain definitions in existing law of the
163 terms “medical management technique,” “network plan,” “provider network
164 contract,” “provider of health care” and “therapeutic equivalent” as those terms
-
*AB74*

– 5 –
165 relate to: (1) individual health insurance; (2) group and blanket health insurance;
166 (3) health insurance for small employers; (4) fraternal benefit societies; (5)
167 nonprofit corporations for hospital, medical and dental service; (6) health
168 maintenance organizations; and (7) managed care organizations. Sections 63, 120-
169 123, 136-149, 151, 152, 160-174, 183-194, 238-250, 255-268, 274-287, 296, 303,
170 306-317, 328, 337, 338 and 349 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate
171 duplicative references in provisions of existing law to which those reorganized
172 definitions apply.
173 Section 135 of this bill removes certain obsolete references to a program for
174 reinsurance. Section 150 of this bill exempts certain health benefit plans from a
175 requirement to include certain provisions relating to reinstatement.
176 Sections 214 and 215 of this bill transfer certain duties of the Commissioner of
177 Financial Institutions to the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending. Sections 219,
178 321, 322 and 345 of this bill revise the conditions under which certain insurers are
179 considered impaired or insolvent for the purpose of conforming more closely to the
180 Insurer Receivership Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance
181 Commissioners.
182 Sections 220 and 334 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of certain
183 information relating to captive insurers. Section 222 of this bill authorizes the
184 Commissioner to exempt a pure captive insurer that only insures risks of its parent
185 and affiliated companies or controlled unaffiliated businesses from certain
186 provisions of existing law applicable to captive insurers generally. For a captive
187 insurer who is not currently transacting the business of insurance and has been
188 issued a certificate of dormancy by the Commissioner, section 224 of this bill: (1)
189 revises the amount of capital and surplus required of a dormant captive insurer; and
190 (2) requires a dormant captive insurer to comply with any applicable
191 responsibilities of the insurer which accrued before the date on which the certificate
192 of dormancy was issued. Section 230 of this bill specifies the minimum amount of
193 the annual premium tax that is required to be paid by a captive insurer in any year
194 in which the captive insurer was not a dormant captive insurer and wrote no direct
195 premiums or assumed no reinsurance premiums. Section 225 of this bill eliminates
196 a requirement for the Commissioner to adopt administrative regulations relating to
197 the competence of an attorney with whom a captive insurer enters into a contract.
198 Section 226 of this bill authorizes the calculation of what constitutes an
199 extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution based on the fiscal year of a
200 captive insurer rather than a calendar year. Sections 227 and 228 of this bill revise
201 provisions relating to certain reporting requirements applicable to certain captive
202 insurers for consistency in existing law among different types of captive insurers.
203 Sections 230 and 231 of this bill: (1) eliminate the Account for the Regulation
204 and Supervision of Captive Insurers; and (2) redirect all fees, assessments, taxes
205 and other sources of funds which are credited to the Account into the Fund for
206 Insurance Administration and Enforcement.
207 Section 254 of this bill revises provisions relating to certain deductibles and
208 coinsurance payments which are applicable to group contracts for hospital, medical
209 or dental services.
210 Section 271 of this bill clarifies the applicability to health maintenance
211 organizations of certain existing laws relating to network plans. Sections 272 and
212 273 of this bill revise certain terminology relating to the capital and surplus of a
213 health maintenance organization.
214 Sections 323-327 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to appoint a person
215 who is not an employee of the Division of Insurance to serve as the administrative
216 supervisor of an insurer which has been placed under administrative supervision by
217 the Commissioner.
218 Section 335 of this bill designates investigators and administrators of the
219 Division who perform certain duties relating to insurance fraud as category II peace
-
*AB74*

– 6 –
220 officers, thus requiring them to meet certain training and educational requirements
221 applicable to those officers.
222 Sections 339 and 341 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to adopt
223 administrative regulations relating to cemeteries and crematories for pets.
224 Sections 347 and 348 of this bill: (1) require an association of self-insured
225 public or private employers to file a corrective action plan with the Commissioner
226 relating to certain deficiencies; and (2) authorize the Commissioner to withdraw the
227 certificate of an association if the association fails to notify the Commissioner of
228 such a deficiency.
229 Section 354 repeals provisions of existing law relating to insurance for home
230 protection. (NRS 645.645, 690B.100-690B.180) Section 354 also repeals a
231 provision applicable to health insurance for small employers which is duplicative of
232 existing law applicable to all group and blanket health insurance. (NRS 689C.320)
233 Sections 53, 182, 195 and 330-332 of this bill make conforming changes by
234 removing and replacing references in existing law to provisions repealed by
235 section 354.

10 of the insurer or other person shall facilitate market conduct
11 actions and aid in market conduct actions so far as it is in their
12 power to do so.
13 Sec. 30. 1. If the Commissioner determines, as the result of
14 market analysis, that further inquiry into an insurer or a pattern
15 or practice of an insurer is needed, the Commissioner may, subject

10 consumers warrant immediate action.
11 2. If the Commissioner has reason to believe that more than

33 2. If the Commissioner determines that other market conduct
34 actions identified in section 30 of this act are not appropriate or if
35 the Commissioner has already conducted another market conduct
36 action but determines that further inquiry into an insurer or the

40 Commissioner shall post notice of that fact, in accordance with the

32 preselected group, must offer its insureds or members the option of
33 selecting a plan of benefits which does not restrict the choice of a
34 dentist. The selection of that option does not entitle the insured or

14 or representatives refuse to submit to examination relative to its

26 3. In addition to the grounds specified in subsections 1 and 2,
27 the Commissioner may refuse to continue or may suspend, limit or

37 have been commenced in any state by the public officer who
38 supervises insurance for that state.
39 5. No proceeding to suspend, limit or revoke a certificate of
40 authority pursuant to this section may be maintained unless it is
41 commenced by the giving of notice to the insurer within 5 years
42 after the occurrence of the charged act or omission. This limitation

4 Sec. 78. NRS 685B.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 685B.050 1. Any act of transacting an insurance business as
6 set forth in NRS 685B.030 by any unauthorized insurer is equivalent
7 to and constitutes an irrevocable appointment by such an insurer,
8 binding upon the insurer, the insurer’s executor or administrator, or
9 successor in interest if a corporation, of the Commissioner or the
10 successor in office of the Commissioner, to be the true and lawful
11 attorney of such an insurer upon whom may be served all lawful
12 process in any action, suit or proceeding in any court by the
13 Commissioner or by the State and upon whom may be served any
14 notice, order, pleading or process in any proceeding before the
15 Commissioner and which arises out of transacting an insurance
16 business in this state by such an insurer. Any act of transacting an
17 insurance business in this state by any unauthorized insurer is
18 signification of its agreement that any such lawful process in such a
19 court action, suit or proceeding and any such notice, order, pleading
20 or process in such an administrative proceeding before the
21 Commissioner so served is of the same legal force and validity as
22 personal service or process in this state upon such an insurer.
23 2. Service of process in such an action must be made by
24 delivering to and leaving with the Commissioner, or some person in
25 apparent charge of the office of the Commissioner, [two copies] one
26 copy thereof and by payment to the Commissioner of the fee
27 prescribed by law. Service upon the Commissioner as attorney is
28 service upon the principal.
29 3. The Commissioner shall forthwith forward [by certified mail
30 one of the copies of] such process or such notice, order, pleading or
31 process in proceedings before the Commissioner to the defendant in
32 such a court proceeding or to whom the notice, order, pleading or
33 process in such an administrative proceeding is addressed or
34 directed at its last known principal place of business . [and shall
35 keep a record of all process so served on him or her which must
36 show the day and hour of service.] Such service is sufficient if:
37 (a) Notice of such service and a copy of the court process or the
38 notice, order, pleading or process in such an administrative
39 proceeding are sent within 10 days thereafter by certified mail by
40 the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney in the court proceeding or by
41 the Commissioner in the administrative proceeding to the defendant
42 in the court proceeding or to whom the notice, order, pleading or
43 process in such an administrative proceeding is addressed or
44 directed at the last known principal place of business of the
45 defendant in the court or administrative proceeding.
-

2 with which the letter is certified, showing the name of the sender of
3 the letter and the name and address of the person or insurer to whom
4 the letter is addressed, and an affidavit of the plaintiff or the
5 plaintiff’s attorney in a court proceeding or of the Commissioner in
6 an administrative proceeding, showing compliance therewith are
7 filed with the clerk of the court in which such an action, suit or
8 proceeding is pending or with the Commissioner in administrative
9 proceedings, on or before the date the defendant in the court or
10 administrative proceedings is required to appear or respond thereto,
11 or within such further time as the court or Commissioner may allow.
12 4. No plaintiff is entitled to a judgment or determination by
13 default in any court or administrative proceeding in which court
14 process or notice, order, pleading or process in proceedings before
15 the Commissioner is served under this section until 45 days after the
16 date of filing of the affidavit of compliance.
17 5. For the purposes of this section, “process” in an action in a
18 court includes only a summons or the initial documents served in
19 such an action. The Commissioner is not required to serve any
20 documents in such an action after the initial service of process.
21 6. Nothing in this section limits or affects the right to serve any
22 process, notice, order or demand upon any person or insurer in any
23 other manner permitted by law.
24 Sec. 79. Chapter 686A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
25 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 80 to 93, inclusive, of this

28 provide detailed loss information which is beyond the scope of the
29 information described in subsection 1, the primary insured may
30 submit to the insurer, by mail, electronic mail or other means, a
31 written request for the additional information. A prospective
32 insurer shall not request more detailed loss information than is
33 reasonably required to underwrite the same line or class of
34 insurance.
35 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, an insurer
36 that receives a written request from a primary insured pursuant to

42 refuse to insure an applicant solely because the prospective
43 insurer is unable to obtain loss reserve information.

45 unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined

6 transfer, merger or consolidation of all or part of the business of
7 the insurer or insurance professional;

38 claim that a person is a subject of domestic violence.
39 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, terminate
40 coverage under a policy of group health insurance for a subject of
41 domestic violence because coverage was originally issued in the
42 name of the perpetrator of domestic violence, and the perpetrator
43 has divorced, separated from or lost custody of the subject of
44 domestic violence or the coverage of the perpetrator has been
45 terminated voluntarily or involuntarily. The provisions of this
-
*AB74*

– 59 –

6 area of the insurer or insurance professional. If the insurer or
7 insurance professional offers conversion to an equivalent
8 individual plan, the insurer or insurance professional may

19 4. For a policy of life insurance, to the extent otherwise
20 permitted by sections 84 to 93, inclusive, of this act and any other
21 applicable law, the provisions of subsection 3 do not prohibit an
22 insurer or insurance professional from asking about a medical
23 condition or from using medical information to underwrite a
24 policy or to carry out its duties under the policy, even if the
25 medical information is related to a medical condition that the
26 insurer or insurance professional knows or has reason to know is
27 related to domestic violence.
28 5. As used in this section “confidential domestic violence
29 information” means information concerning:
30 (a) An act of domestic violence;
31 (b) The domestic violence status of a subject of domestic
32 violence; or
33 (c) The status of an applicant or insured as a family member,
34 employer or associate of, or a person in a relationship with, a
35 subject of domestic violence.
36 Sec. 92. 1. A person shall not engage in any conduct that is
37 unfairly discriminatory pursuant to this section.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, for a policy
39 of property or casualty insurance it is unfairly discriminatory to:
40 (a) Exclude or limit payment for a covered loss or deny a
41 covered claim incurred as a result of domestic violence by a
42 person other than a co-insured;
43 (b) Fail to pay losses arising out of domestic violence to an

45 the legal interest of the first-party claimant in the covered
-
*AB74*

– 60 –
1 property, if the loss is caused by the intentional act of an insured;
2 or
3 (c) Use exclusions or limitations on coverage which the
4 Commissioner has determined unreasonably restrict the ability of
5 a subject of domestic violence to be indemnified for losses.
6 3. The provisions of subsection 2:
7 (a) Do not require payment in excess of the loss or policy
8 limits; and
9 (b) Do not prohibit an insurer or insurance professional from
10 applying reasonable standards to proof of claims.
11 Sec. 93. An insurer or insurance professional that takes an
12 action that adversely affects an applicant or insured on the basis
13 of a medical condition that the insurer or insurance professional
14 knows or has reason to know is related to domestic violence:
15 1. Shall explain the reason for its action to the applicant or
16 insured in writing; and
17 2. At the request of the Commissioner, must be able to
18 demonstrate that the action and any applicable policy provisions:
19 (a) Do not have the purpose or effect of treating domestic
20 violence status as a medical condition or underwriting criteria;
21 (b) Are not based on any actual or perceived correlation
22 between a medical condition and domestic violence;
23 (c) Are otherwise permitted by law and applied in the same
24 manner and to the same extent to all applicants and insureds with
25 a similar medical condition, without regard to whether the
26 condition or claim is related to domestic violence; and
27 (d) Except for claims actions, are based on a determination,
28 made in conformance with sound actuarial principles and
29 otherwise supported by actual or reasonably anticipated
30 experience, that there is a correlation between the medical
31 condition and a material increase in insurance risk.

35 producer of insurance or group of [the bank. For the purposes of]
36 producers.
37 2. A person, bank or affiliate shall not reject a policy of

34 required of those producers or insurers affiliated or in any way
35 connected with the person who lends money or extends credit.

1 (g) Pay or receive any commission, brokerage fee or other
2 compensation as a producer of insurance, unless the person holds

4 This paragraph does not prohibit a person who is not licensed as a
5 producer from making a referral to a licensed producer if the
6 person does not discuss any specific terms and conditions of a
7 policy of insurance. This paragraph does not prohibit a person
8 who is not licensed as a producer from being compensated for a
9 referral. In the case of a referral of a customer, the compensation
10 must be a fixed dollar amount for each referral that does not
11 depend on whether the customer purchases an insurance product
12 from the licensed producer. Any person who accepts deposits from
13 the public in an area where such transactions are routinely
14 conducted in the bank may not receive more than a one-time,
15 nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral of a
16 customer that does not depend on whether the referral results in a
17 transaction.

20 solicitation or sale is completed through documents which are
21 separate from any transaction involving credit;

23 practicable, physically separated from the areas where retail
24 deposits are routinely accepted by banks; and

26 distinct books and records relating to the transactions involving
27 insurance, including, without limitation, all files relating to and
28 reflecting any complaint of a consumer.
29 (i) Include the expense of insurance premiums, other than
30 credit insurance premiums or flood insurance premiums, in the
31 primary transaction involving credit without the express written
32 consent of the customer.
33 4. A person, bank or affiliate that lends money or extends
34 credit and that solicits insurance primarily for personal, family or
35 household purposes shall disclose to the customer in writing that
36 the insurance related to an extension of credit may be purchased
37 from an insurer or producer of insurance that the customer
38 chooses, subject to the right of the lender to reject a given insurer
39 or agent as provided in paragraph (b) of subsection 3. The
40 disclosure must inform the customer that the insurer or producer
41 the customer chooses will not affect the decision to extend credit
42 or terms of credit in any way, except that the person, bank or
43 affiliate may impose reasonable requirements concerning the
44 creditworthiness of the insurer and the scope of coverage chosen
45 as provided in paragraph (b) of subsection 3.

16 written acknowledgment from the customer of receipt of the
17 disclosure described in paragraph (a), either at the time of receipt
18 or at the time of the initial purchase of the policy of insurance. If
19 the solicitation is conducted by telephone, the person or bank shall
20 obtain oral acknowledgment from the customer of receipt of the
21 disclosure, maintain sufficient documentation of the oral
22 acknowledgment and make reasonable efforts to obtain a written
23 acknowledgment from the customer. If a customer affirmatively
24 consents to receiving the disclosure by electronic means and the
25 disclosure is provided in a format that the customer may retain or
26 obtain later, the person or bank may provide the disclosure by
27 electronic means and obtain acknowledgment from the customer
28 of receipt of the disclosure by electronic means.
29 6. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 5 apply:
30 (a) Only:

42 sale, advertisement or offer of the insurance is by or on behalf of
43 the bank;

6 8. The Commissioner may examine and investigate the
7 insurance activities of any person, insurer, bank or affiliate that
8 the Commissioner believes may be in violation of this section. The
9 person, insurer, bank or affiliate shall make its books and records
10 available to the Commissioner for inspection upon reasonable
11 notice. A person who is affected by a violation or potential
12 violation of this section may submit a complaint or other material
13 pertinent to the enforcement of this section to the Commissioner.
14 Any examination undertaken pursuant to this subsection must be
15 conducted in accordance with sections 2 to 41, inclusive, of this
16 act.
17 9. Nothing in this section:
18 (a) Prevents a person, bank or affiliate that lends money or
19 extends credit from placing insurance on real or personal property
20 in the event that a mortgagor, borrower or purchaser has failed to
21 provide required insurance in accordance with the terms of a loan

30 of the [agent,] producer of insurance, cancel a written agreement

32 authority of the producer to transact property or casualty insurance
33 based solely on the loss ratio experience on insurance transacted by
34 that [agent,] producer, if the [agent] producer was required to
35 submit the applications for that insurance for underwriting approval,
36 all material information on those applications was fully completed
37 and the [agent] producer did not omit or alter any information
38 provided by the applicants for that insurance.
39 2. As used in this section, “loss ratio experience” means the
40 amount of money received by the insurer in payment of premiums

16 after the giving of notice of withdrawal, as the Commissioner in
17 such notice prescribes.
18 5. The Commissioner may, by order, exempt from the
19 requirements of this section for so long as the Commissioner deems
20 proper any insurance document or form or type thereof specified in

9 capital calculation for United States operations of any non-United
