Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial insurance if,
2 during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a workplace accident or
3 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) [Existing law authorizes] Section 4.1 of
4 this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department
5 of Business and Industry to [order] give notice before conducting certain [additional
6 payments to a claimant in the form of benefit penalties, if the Administrator determines that
7 an] inspections at the physical office of an insurer [, organization for managed care, health
8 care provider,] or third-party administrator . [, employer or professional employer
9 organization has committed certain violations. (NRS 616A.070, 616D.120) Sections 3 and 30
10 of this bill additionally authorize the imposition of benefit penalties under certain

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 4
11 circumstances for: (1) failure to provide or unreasonably delaying payment to an injured
12 employee or reimbursement to an insurer; or (2) concealing, falsifying or failing to provide
13 certain evidence or documents before certain hearings which would have been useful to an
14 injured employee in seeking benefits or compensation.] For purposes of calculating the
15 amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the terms of a policy of industrial
16 insurance, existing law provides that the maximum amount paid to any one employee for
17 services provided during the 12-month period during which a policy is effective shall be
18 deemed to be $36,000. (NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000
19 amount and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation of the maximum
20 average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security Division of the
21 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation.
22 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-insured
23 employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the Commissioner of
24 Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for the benefit of any person
25 damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the administrator. (NRS 616B.503,
26 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also requires the third-party administrator to file
27 with the Commissioner an additional surety bond conditioned upon the faithful
28 performance of its duties relative to a particular association of self-insured employers.
29 (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party
30 administrator to file an additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular
31 association. Section 4.4 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure
32 for terminating liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
33 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-
34 Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires money in
35 the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in situations where
36 an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical impairment incurs a subsequent
37 disability by injury arising out of and in the course of employment which entitles the
38 employee to compensation for the combined disability that is substantially greater than
39 that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-
40 616B.581) Existing law and regulations require associations of self-insured public or
41 private employers to pay an annual assessment which funds the Account. (NRS
42 616B.575; chapter 616B of NAC) Section 4.5 of this bill removes the authority to adopt
43 regulations which impose such assessments from the Board for the Administration of the
44 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private
45 Employers, and section 33.5 of this bill voids the provisions of existing regulations
46 relating to such assessments, thus eliminating the requirement for assessments to be paid
47 for the Account. Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this bill require an employee to have incurred a
48 subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30, 2025, in order for the
49 compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against
50 the Account because of a subsequent disability by injury which is incurred on or after
51 October 1, 2025.
52 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
53 authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain circumstances, to
54 delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to a physician assistant
55 who is an employee of and under the supervision of the physician or chiropractic
56 physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the Administrator to select a closed formulary
57 that is required to be used by industrial insurers for any drug which is prescribed and
58 dispensed for outpatient use. Section 9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from
59 providing reimbursement for a drug that is not listed and approved on the formulary,
60 when use of the formulary is required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal
61 to a hearings officer any determination denying a request for a drug which has been
62 recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming
63 change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and determining
64 if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured employee.
65 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic physicians
66 from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a panel established
67 and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth procedures and limitations
68 governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS
69 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 5
70 physician or chiropractic physician from the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in
71 existing law; [and] (2) requires an insurer to replace any physician or chiropractic physician
72 who is removed from the list within 60 days [.] ; (3) authorizes certain audits and revisions
73 of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements relating to the insurer’s
74 list. [Sections 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13 of this bill: (1) require an insurer to keep a list of certain
75 providers of health care other than a physician or chiropractic physician, which section 1 of
76 this bill designates as an “industrial provider of health care,” from which an injured employee
77 may choose to receive treatment from a panel established and maintained by the
78 Administrator; and (2) establish certain requirements and restrictions concerning the selection
79 of such an industrial provider of health care. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
80 so that the definition of “industrial provider of health care” applies to the provisions of
81 existing law governing industrial insurance.
82 Section 8 of this bill authorizes a hearing officer or appeals officer of the Hearings
83 Division of the Department of Administration to order any needed examination, assessment or
84 treatment of an injured employee be conducted by any physician, chiropractic physician or
85 industrial provider of health care who will accept the fee schedule adopted by the
86 Administrator, whether located in this State or another state, if the hearing or appeals officer
87 finds that there is a lack of physicians, chiropractic physicians or providers available. Section
88 9 of this bill establishes certain requirements for the filing and service of certain evidence and
89 documents in advance of a hearing before a hearing officer or appeals officer.
90 Existing law requires a treating physician, chiropractic physician, physician assistant or
91 advanced practice registered nurse to complete and file a claim for compensation within 3
92 working days after first providing treatment for an injured employee, or delegate the duty to
93 do so to a physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse at a medical facility. (NRS
94 616C.040, 616C.045) Sections 10 and 11 of this bill similarly authorize a treating physician,
95 chiropractic physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse to delegate
96 the duty to complete and file the claim for compensation to an industrial provider of health
97 care.]
98 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is caused by
99 stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in the course of his or
100 her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which such an injury must be proven
101 to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. Under existing law, with certain
102 exceptions, such an injury is deemed to arise out of and in the course of employment only if
103 the employee proves certain elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric
104 evidence. (NRS 616C.180) Section 17 of this bill [eliminates provisions that make such
105 method of proof the only method, with certain exceptions, by which an employee may prove
106 that such an injury arose in and out of the course of employment. Section 17 additionally
107 eliminates the standard of clear and convincing evidence and] instead requires proof by clear
108 and convincing medical, psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an
109 insurer to maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental
110 health care from which an injured employee may choose.
111 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the Department of
112 Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the Internet website of the
113 Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing officers and appeals officers.
114 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances under
115 which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of a
116 hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may grant a motion to stay the
117 enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer. Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise
118 certain procedures for the judicial review of the decision of an appeals officer.
119 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law requires an
120 industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days after receipt of the initial
121 certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill
122 [establishes the same requirements for payment when a claim] requires, for a period of
123 temporary partial disability [is allowed.] , the first payment or a determination regarding
124 payment to be issued within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
125 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
126 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the Nevada
127 Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29 of this bill prohibit
128 a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise provisions governing the

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 6
129 circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow discovery. Section 30 of this bill
130 revises provisions relating to administrative fines which the Administrator may impose
131 for certain violations.
132 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination concerning
133 accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS 616C.305) Existing law
134 requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability resulting from occupational
135 disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be made jointly by the attending physician
136 and examining physician of a claimant, or, under certain circumstances, a designated third
137 physician or panel of physicians. (NRS 616C.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those
138 procedures and requirements, and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make
139 conforming changes to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing
140 law. Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
141 who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
142 employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law also requires the Commissioner, at
143 least annually, to audit each association of self-insured employers to verify certain
144 information. (NRS 616B.410) Section 34 repeals the requirement that the Commissioner
145 examine each association annually.

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 8
1 Sec. 4.3. NRS 616B.353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 616B.353 1. An association of self-insured public or private employers
3 shall:
4 (a) Execute an indemnity agreement jointly and severally binding the
5 association and each member of the association to secure the payment of all
6 compensation due pursuant to chapters 616A to 617, inclusive, of NRS. The

14 Commissioner shall consider:
15 (1) The number of members in the association;
16 (2) If the association is an association of self-insured public employers, the
17 types of governmental services provided by the members of the association;
18 (3) If the association is an association of self-insured private employers,
19 the classifications of employment of the members of the association;
20 (4) The number of years the association has been in existence; and
21 (5) Such other information as the Commissioner deems necessary.

28 (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e), deposit as security with the
29 Commissioner a bond executed by the association as principal, and by a licensed
30 surety, payable to the State of Nevada, and conditioned upon the payment of
31 compensation for injuries and occupational diseases to their employees. The bond

34 $100,000.
35 (e) In lieu of a bond, deposit with the Commissioner a like amount of lawful
36 money of the United States or any other form of security authorized by NRS

1 3. In lieu of complying with the requirements of subsection 2, the
2 association’s administrator shall ensure that a solvency bond, in a form prescribed
3 by the Commissioner and in an aggregate amount of at least $2,500,000, is
4 deposited with the Commissioner by the association or members of the association
5 on behalf of the association.
6 4. The association’s administrator shall deposit with the Commissioner a
7 bond executed by the association’s administrator as principal, and by a licensed
8 surety, payable to the State of Nevada, and conditioned upon the faithful
9 performance of his or her duties. The bond must be in an amount determined by the

15 amount determined by the Commissioner.
16 6.] The Commissioner may increase or decrease the amount of any bond or
17 money required to be deposited by this section in accordance with chapter 681B of

19 the Commissioner requires an association [,] or association’s administrator [or
20 third-party administrator] to increase its deposit, the Commissioner may specify the
21 form of the additional security. The association [,] or association’s administrator [or
22 third-party administrator] shall comply with such a requirement within 60 days
23 after receiving notice from the Commissioner.
24 [7.] 6. The Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public and Private
25 Employers is hereby created in the State Agency Fund for Bonds. All money
26 received by the Commissioner pursuant to this section must be deposited with the
27 State Treasurer to the credit of the Account. All claims against this Account must
28 be paid as other claims against the State are paid.
29 Sec. 4.4. NRS 616B.440 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 616B.440 1. For the purposes of NRS 616B.350 to 616B.446, inclusive, an
31 association of self-insured public or private employers is insolvent if it is unable to
32 pay its outstanding obligations as they mature in the regular course of its business.
33 2. If an association of self-insured public or private employers becomes
34 insolvent, institutes any voluntary proceeding pursuant to the Bankruptcy Act or is
35 named in any voluntary proceeding thereunder, makes a general or special
36 assignment for the benefit of creditors or fails to pay compensation pursuant to
37 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS after an order for the
38 payment of any claim becomes final, the Commissioner may, after giving at least
39 10 days’ notice to the association and any insurer or guarantor, use money or
40 interest on securities, sell securities or institute legal proceedings on surety bonds
41 deposited with the Commissioner pursuant to NRS 679B.175 to the extent
42 necessary to make those payments.
43 3. A licensed surety providing a surety bond pursuant to NRS 616B.353 may
44 terminate liability on its surety bond by giving the Commissioner and the
45 association [,] or association’s administrator [or third-party administrator] 90 days’
46 written notice. The termination does not limit liability that was incurred under the
47 surety bond before the termination.
48 Sec. 4.5. NRS 616B.575 is hereby amended to read as follows:
49 616B.575 1. There is hereby created in the Fund for Workers’
50 Compensation and Safety in the State Treasury the Subsequent Injury Account for
51 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers, which may be used only

1 616B.581. The Board shall administer the Account based upon recommendations
2 made by the Administrator pursuant to subsection [8.] 7.
3 2. All [assessments,] penalties, bonds, securities and all other properties
4 received, collected or acquired by the Board for the Subsequent Injury Account for

6 custody of the State Treasurer.

34 Sec. 4.6. NRS 616B.578 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 616B.578 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.581:
36 1. If an employee of a member of an association of self-insured public or
37 private employers has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin
38 and incurs , on or before September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury
39 arising out of and in the course of his or her employment which entitles the
40 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater by reason of
41 the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than
42 that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the compensation
43 due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-
44 Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted by the
45 Board.
46 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or before
47 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined that the death
48 would not have occurred except for the preexisting permanent physical impairment,
49 the compensation due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for
50 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with
51 regulations adopted by the Board.
52 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment” means any
53 permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by injury or disease, of such

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 11
1 seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to obtaining employment or to
2 obtaining reemployment if the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this
3 section, a condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
4 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of the whole person
5 if evaluated according to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the
6 Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as adopted and supplemented by the Division
7 pursuant to NRS 616C.110.
8 4. To qualify under this section for reimbursement from the Subsequent
9 Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers, the
10 association of self-insured public or private employers must establish by written
11 records that the employer had knowledge of the “permanent physical impairment”
12 at the time the employee was hired or that the employee was retained in
13 employment after the employer acquired such knowledge.
14 5. An association of self-insured public or private employers must submit to
15 the Board a claim for reimbursement from the Subsequent Injury Account for
16 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.
17 6. The Board shall adopt regulations establishing procedures for submitting
18 claims against the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
19 Public or Private Employers. The Board shall notify the Association of Self-Insured
20 Public or Private Employers of its decision on such a claim within 120 days after
21 the claim is received.
22 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against the Subsequent
23 Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers must
24 be submitted directly to the district court.
25 Sec. 4.7. NRS 616B.581 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 616B.581 1. An association of self-insured public or private employers that
27 pays compensation due to an employee who has a permanent physical impairment
28 from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30, 2025, a
29 subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of his or her
30 employment which entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
31 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting
32 impairment and the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
33 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury
34 Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:
35 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to his or her
36 physical condition at the time the employee was hired by the member of the
37 Association of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers;
38 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this reliance formed
39 a substantial basis of the employment; and
40 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation and the
41 subsequent disability.
42  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before September 30,
43 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined that the death would not have
44 occurred except for the preexisting permanent physical impairment, any
45 compensation paid is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account
46 for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.
47 2. An association of self-insured public or private employers shall notify the
48 Board of any possible claim against the Subsequent Injury Account for
49 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers pursuant to this section
50 no later than 60 days after the date of the subsequent injury or the date the employer
51 learns of the employee’s false representation, whichever is later.

5 5. Each insurer shall, not later than October 1 of each year, update the list

10 Sec. 7. [1. The Administrator shall establish, maintain and update not

24 care.
25 (f) Every discipline and specialization practiced by the industrial provider of
26 health care.
27 (g) Every condition and part of the body which the industrial provider of
28 health care will treat.
29 2. Every employer whose insurer has not entered into a contract with an
30 organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
31 616B.527 shall maintain a list of those industrial providers of health care on the
32 panel who are reasonably accessible to his or her employees.
33 3. An injured employee whose employer’s insurer has not entered into a
34 contract with an organization for managed care or with providers of health care
35 pursuant to NRS 616B.527 may choose an industrial provider of health care from
36 the panel of industrial providers of health care. If the injured employee is not
37 satisfied with the first industrial provider of health care he or she so chooses, the
38 injured employee may make an alternative choice of industrial provider of health
39 care from the panel if the choice is made within 90 days after his or her injury.
40 The insurer shall notify the first industrial provider of health care in writing. The
41 notice must be postmarked within 3 working days after the insurer receives
42 knowledge of the change. The first industrial provider of health care must be
43 reimbursed only for the services the industrial provider of health care rendered to
44 the injured employee up to and including the date of notification. Except as
45 otherwise provided in this subsection, any further change is subject to the
46 approval of the insurer or by order of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A
47 request for a change of industrial provider of health care must be granted or
48 denied within 10 days after a written request for such a change is received from
49 the injured employee. If the insurer takes no action on the request within 10 days,
50 the request shall be deemed granted. Any request for a change of an industrial
51 provider of health care must include the name of the new industrial provider of
52 health care chosen by the injured employee. If the industrial provider of health
53 care refers the injured employee to a specialist for treatment, the insurer shall

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 15
1 provide to the injured employee a list that includes the name of each industrial
2 provider of health care with that specialization who is on the panel. Not later
3 than 14 days after receiving the list, the injured employee shall select an
4 industrial provider of health care from the list.
5 4. An injured employee whose employer’s insurer has entered into a
6 contract with an organization for managed care or with providers of health care
7 pursuant to NRS 616B.527 must choose an industrial provider of health care
8 pursuant to the terms of that contract. If the injured employee is not satisfied with
9 the first industrial provider of health care he or she so chooses, the injured
10 employee may make an alternative choice of industrial provider of health care
11 pursuant to the terms of the contract without the approval of the insurer if the
12 choice is made within 90 days after his or her injury. Except as otherwise
13 provided in this subsection, any further change is subject to the approval of the
14 insurer or by order of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A request for a change
15 of an industrial provider of health care must be granted or denied within 10 days
16 after a written request for such a change is received from the injured employee. If
17 the insurer takes no action on the request within 10 days, the request shall be
18 deemed granted. If the injured employee, after choosing an industrial provider of
19 health care, moves to a county which is not served by the organization for
20 managed care or providers of health care named in the contract and the insurer
21 determines that it is impractical for the injured employee to continue treatment
22 with the industrial provider of health care, the injured employee must choose an
23 industrial provider of health care who has agreed to the terms of that contract
24 unless the insurer authorizes the injured employee to choose another industrial
25 provider of health care. If the industrial provider of health care refers the injured
26 employee to a specialist for treatment, the insurer shall provide to the injured
27 employee a list that includes the name of each industrial provider of health care
28 with that specialization who is available pursuant to the terms of the contract
29 with the organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant
30 to NRS 616B.527, as appropriate. Not later than 14 days after receiving the list,
31 the injured employee shall select an industrial provider of health care. If the
32 employee fails to select an industrial provider of health care, the insurer may
33 select an industrial provider of health care with that specialization. If an
34 industrial provider of health care with that specialization is not available
35 pursuant to the terms of the contract, the organization for managed care or the
36 provider of health care may select an industrial provider of health care with that
37 specialization.
38 5. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the industrial provider of
39 health care selected by himself or herself or by the insurer, the organization for
40 managed care or the provider of health care pursuant to subsection 4, the injured
41 employee may make an alternative choice of an industrial provider of health care
42 pursuant to the terms of the contract. A change in the industrial provider of
43 health care may be made at any time but is subject to the approval of the insurer
44 or by order of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A request for a change of
45 industrial provider of health care must be granted or denied within 10 days after
46 a written request for such a change is received from the injured employee. If no
47 action is taken on the request within 10 days, the request shall be deemed
48 granted. Any request for a change of an industrial provider of health care must
49 include the name of the new industrial provider of health care chosen by the
50 injured employee. If the insurer denies a request for a change in the industrial
51 provider of health care under this subsection, the insurer must include in a
52 written notice of denial to the injured employee the specific reason for the denial
53 of the request.

Senate Amendment No. 312 to Senate Bill No. 317 Page 16
1 6. Except when emergency medical care is required and except as otherwise
2 provided in NRS 616C.055, the insurer is not responsible for any charges for
3 medical treatment or other accident benefits furnished or ordered by any
4 industrial provider of health care or other person selected by the injured
5 employee in disregard of the provisions of this section or for any compensation
6 for any aggravation of the injured employee’s injury attributable to improper
7 treatments by such industrial provider of health care or other person.
8 7. The Administrator may order necessary changes in a panel of industrial
9 providers of health care and shall:
10 (a) Suspend or remove any industrial provider of health care from a panel
11 for good cause shown in accordance with section 6 of this act; and
12 (b) Remove from being included on a panel any industrial provider of health
13 care who does not accept and treat injured employees for industrial injuries or
14 occupational diseases.
15 8. Any interested person may notify the Administrator, on a form prescribed
16 by the Administrator, if the person believes that an industrial provider of health
17 care does not accept and treat injured employees under chapters 616A to 616D,
18 inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS for industrial injuries or occupational diseases.
19 9. If the Administrator receives notice pursuant to subsection 8, the
20 Administrator shall:
21 (a) Conduct an investigation to determine whether the industrial provider of
22 health care may remain on the panel; and
23 (b) Publish or cause to be published on the Internet website of the Division
24 not later than 90 days after receiving the notice the results of the investigation.
25 10. An industrial provider of health care who is removed from a panel
26 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 7 may request, on a form prescribed by
27 the Administrator, to be reinstated on a panel if the industrial provider of health
28 care demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that he or she accepts
29 and treats injured employees.
30 11. An injured employee may receive treatment by more than one industrial
31 provider of health care:
32 (a) If the insurer provides written authorization for such treatment; or
33 (b) By order of a hearing officer or appeals officer.
34 12. The Administrator shall design a form that notifies injured employees of
35 their right pursuant to subsections 3, 4 and 5 to select an alternative industrial
36 provider of health care and make the form available to insurers for distribution
37 pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 616C.050.] (Deleted by amendment.)
38 Sec. 8. [1. Upon a finding of good cause in accordance with subsection 2,
39 a hearing officer or an appeals officer may order any needed examination,
40 assessment or treatment by a physician, chiropractic physician or industrial
41 provider of health care be conducted by any physician, chiropractic physician or
42 industrial provider of health care who will accept the fee schedule adopted by the
43 Administrator, whether the physician, chiropractic physician or industrial
44 provider of health care is located in this State or another state.
45 2. For the purpose of subsection 1, good cause exists if a hearing officer or
46 appeals officer finds, for the examination, assessment or treatment which is
47 needed, that there is a lack of physicians, chiropractic physicians or industrial
48 providers of health care available to provide the examination, assessment or
49 treatment.] (Deleted by amendment.)

15 Account.
16 9. Any party aggrieved by a determination made by the Division regarding
17 the assignment of any claim made pursuant to this section may appeal that
18 determination by filing a notice of appeal with an appeals officer within 30 days
19 after the determination is rendered. The provisions of NRS 616C.345 to 616C.385,
20 inclusive, apply to an appeal filed pursuant to this subsection.
21 10. Any party aggrieved by a determination to accept or to deny any claim
22 made pursuant to this section or by a determination to pay or to deny the payment
23 of compensation regarding any claim made pursuant to this section may appeal that

32 calculated at a rate equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as
33 ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on January 1 or July 1,
34 as the case may be, immediately preceding the date of the claim, plus 3 percent,

46 judgment pursuant to NRS 617.4015 and the Division assigns a debt that arises
47 under this section to the State Controller for collection pursuant to NRS 353C.195,
48 the State Controller may bring an action in his or her own name in a court of
49 competent jurisdiction to recover any amount that the Division is authorized to
