Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law requires an insurer or its third-party administrator to operate or maintain a
5 physical office in this State for certain purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027,
6 616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this bill authorize a legal representative
7 of the insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, to operate or maintain such
8 an office. Section 4.1 also requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial
9 Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before
10 conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an insurer, third-party
11 administrator or other legal representative. Section 4.15 also: (1) authorizes certain
12 information to be provided as an electronic copy or in an electronic format upon
13 request; and (2) revises certain requirements for availability to communicate with a
14 claimant or representative of the claimant if a private carrier or third-party
15 administrator operates an office in this State.
16 Existing law authorizes certain persons to administer certain claims from a
17 location in or outside of this State. (NRS 616B.0275) Section 4.17 of this bill
18 additionally authorizes certain self-insured private employers and certain entities
19 associated with the employer to administer certain claims from a location in or
20 outside of this State if the total aggregate number of employees of the employer and
21 associated entities is 30,000 or more.
22 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
23 the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
24 maximum amount paid to any one employee for services provided during the 12-
25 month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
26 (NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000 amount for an
27 employer other than the State of Nevada or any agency or political subdivision of
28 the State and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation of the
29 maximum average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security
30 Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Section
31 4.2 authorizes the State or any agency or political subdivision of the State to elect
32 to be subject to the calculation used by other employers, in accordance with any
33 procedures established by the Administrator for the making of such an election.
34 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
35 insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
36 Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
37 the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
38 administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
39 requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
40 surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
41 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of
42 this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an
43 additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4
44 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure for terminating
45 liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
46 Existing law requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each
47 association of self-insured public or private employers to verify certain information,
48 including the standard industrial classification of each member of the association.
49 (NRS 616B.410) Section 4.37 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Commissioner to
50 require each association, at least annually, to audit the payroll of each member of
51 the association to verify certain information including the classification or
52 classifications, rather than the standard industrial classification, of each member;
53 and (2) authorizes the Commissioner to require the submission of a report
54 summarizing the results of such an audit. Section 4.33 of this bill similarly removes
-
*SB317_R3*

– 3 –
55 a reference to the standard industrial classification of a member of an association of
56 self-insured public or private employers.
57 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
58 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires
59 money in the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
60 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
61 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
62 of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
63 disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
64 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this
65 bill require an employee to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or
66 before September 30, 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement
67 provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the Account because of a
68 subsequent disability by injury which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.
69 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
70 authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain
71 circumstances, to delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to
72 a physician assistant who is an employee of and under the supervision of the
73 physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the
74 Administrator to adopt the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary
75 published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is required to be used by industrial
76 insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section
77 9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer, with certain exceptions, from providing
78 reimbursement for a drug that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when
79 use of the formulary is required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal
80 to a hearings officer any determination denying a request for a drug which has been
81 recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming
82 change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and
83 determining if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured
84 employee.
85 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
86 physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
87 panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
88 procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
89 physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
90 (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
91 the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; (2) requires an
92 insurer, under certain circumstances, to replace any physician or chiropractic
93 physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain audits
94 and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements
95 relating to the insurer’s list.
96 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
97 caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
98 the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
99 such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
100 employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
101 to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
102 elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)
103 Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and convincing medical,
104 psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer to
105 maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health
106 care from which an injured employee may choose.
107 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
108 Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
-
*SB317_R3*

– 4 –
109 Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
110 officers and appeals officers.
111 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
112 under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
113 the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
114 grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.
115 Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
116 the decision of an appeals officer.
117 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
118 requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
119 after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
120 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill requires, for a period of temporary partial
121 disability, the first payment or a determination regarding payment to be issued
122 within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
123 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
124 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
125 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
126 of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
127 provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
128 discovery. Section 30 of this bill revises provisions relating to administrative fines
129 which the Administrator may impose for certain violations.
130 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
131 concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
132 616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
133 resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
134 made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
135 under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
136 (NRS 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
137 and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
138 to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.
139 Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
140 who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
141 employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003)

17 616B.407 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,

22 (b) Based on the premium rate for the [standard industrial]
23 classification of that member, adjusted by the member’s individual
24 experience.

30 hearing, it is shown that the self-insured employer, association of
31 self-insured public or private employers or third-party administrator
32 violated any provision of subsection 1.
33 9. If the Administrator determines that a vocational
34 rehabilitation counselor has violated the provisions of NRS
