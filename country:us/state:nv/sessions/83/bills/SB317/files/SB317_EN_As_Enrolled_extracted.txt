Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
law requires an insurer or its third-party administrator to operate or maintain a
physical office in this State for certain purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027,
616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this bill authorize a legal representative
of the insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, to operate or maintain such
an office. Section 4.1 also requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial
Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before
conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an insurer, third-party
administrator or other legal representative. Section 4.15 also: (1) authorizes certain
information to be provided as an electronic copy or in an electronic format upon
request; and (2) revises certain requirements for availability to communicate with a
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
claimant or representative of the claimant if a private carrier or third-party
administrator operates an office in this State.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to administer certain claims from a
location in or outside of this State. (NRS 616B.0275) Section 4.17 of this bill
additionally authorizes certain self-insured private employers and certain entities
associated with the employer to administer certain claims from a location in or
outside of this State if the total aggregate number of employees of the employer and
associated entities is 30,000 or more.
For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
maximum amount paid to any one employee for services provided during the 12-
month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
(NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000 amount for an
employer other than the State of Nevada or any agency or political subdivision of
the State and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation of the
maximum average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security
Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Section

Section 2:
4.2 authorizes the State or any agency or political subdivision of the State to elect
to be subject to the calculation used by other employers, in accordance with any
procedures established by the Administrator for the making of such an election.
Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of
this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an
additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4
of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure for terminating
liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
Existing law requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each
association of self-insured public or private employers to verify certain information,
including the standard industrial classification of each member of the association.
(NRS 616B.410) Section 4.37 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Commissioner to
require each association, at least annually, to audit the payroll of each member of
the association to verify certain information including the classification or
classifications, rather than the standard industrial classification, of each member;
and (2) authorizes the Commissioner to require the submission of a report
summarizing the results of such an audit. Section 4.33 of this bill similarly removes
a reference to the standard industrial classification of a member of an association of
self-insured public or private employers.
Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires
money in the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this
bill require an employee to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or
before September 30, 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the Account because of a
subsequent disability by injury which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.

Section 3:
Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain
circumstances, to delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to
a physician assistant who is an employee of and under the supervision of the
physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the
Administrator to adopt the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary
published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is required to be used by industrial
insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section

Section 4:
9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer, with certain exceptions, from providing
reimbursement for a drug that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when
use of the formulary is required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal
to a hearings officer any determination denying a request for a drug which has been
recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming
change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and
determining if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured
employee.
Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
(1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; (2) requires an
insurer, under certain circumstances, to replace any physician or chiropractic
physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain audits
and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements
relating to the insurer’s list.
Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)

Section 5:
Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and convincing medical,
psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer to
maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health
care from which an injured employee may choose.

Section 6:
Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
officers and appeals officers.

Section 7:
Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.

Section 8:
Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
the decision of an appeals officer.
If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 4 –
616C.475) Section 27 of this bill requires, for a period of temporary partial
disability, the first payment or a determination regarding payment to be issued
within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
discovery. Section 30 of this bill revises provisions relating to administrative fines
which the Administrator may impose for certain violations.
Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
(NRS 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.
Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003)

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
law requires an insurer or its third-party administrator to operate or maintain a
physical office in this State for certain purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027,
616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this bill authorize a legal representative
of the insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, to operate or maintain such
an office. Section 4.1 also requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial
Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before
conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an insurer, third-party
administrator or other legal representative. Section 4.15 also: (1) authorizes certain
information to be provided as an electronic copy or in an electronic format upon
request; and (2) revises certain requirements for availability to communicate with a
-

– 2 –
claimant or representative of the claimant if a private carrier or third-party
administrator operates an office in this State.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to administer certain claims from a
location in or outside of this State. (NRS 616B.0275) Section 4.17 of this bill
additionally authorizes certain self-insured private employers and certain entities
associated with the employer to administer certain claims from a location in or
outside of this State if the total aggregate number of employees of the employer and
associated entities is 30,000 or more.
For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
maximum amount paid to any one employee for services provided during the 12-
month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
(NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000 amount for an
employer other than the State of Nevada or any agency or political subdivision of
the State and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation of the
maximum average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security
Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Section
4.2 authorizes the State or any agency or political subdivision of the State to elect
to be subject to the calculation used by other employers, in accordance with any
procedures established by the Administrator for the making of such an election.
Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of
this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an
additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4
of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure for terminating
liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
Existing law requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each
association of self-insured public or private employers to verify certain information,
including the standard industrial classification of each member of the association.
(NRS 616B.410) Section 4.37 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Commissioner to
require each association, at least annually, to audit the payroll of each member of
the association to verify certain information including the classification or
classifications, rather than the standard industrial classification, of each member;
and (2) authorizes the Commissioner to require the submission of a report
summarizing the results of such an audit. Section 4.33 of this bill similarly removes
a reference to the standard industrial classification of a member of an association of
self-insured public or private employers.
Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires
money in the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this
bill require an employee to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or
before September 30, 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the Account because of a
subsequent disability by injury which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.
Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain
circumstances, to delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to
a physician assistant who is an employee of and under the supervision of the
physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the
Administrator to adopt the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary
published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is required to be used by industrial
insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section
9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer, with certain exceptions, from providing
reimbursement for a drug that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when
use of the formulary is required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal
to a hearings officer any determination denying a request for a drug which has been
recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming
change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and
determining if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured
employee.
Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
(1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; (2) requires an
insurer, under certain circumstances, to replace any physician or chiropractic
physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain audits
and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements
relating to the insurer’s list.
Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)
Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and convincing medical,
psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer to
maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health
care from which an injured employee may choose.
Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
officers and appeals officers.
Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.
Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
the decision of an appeals officer.
If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
616C.475) Section 27 of this bill requires, for a period of temporary partial
disability, the first payment or a determination regarding payment to be issued
within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
discovery. Section 30 of this bill revises provisions relating to administrative fines
which the Administrator may impose for certain violations.
Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
(NRS 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.
Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003)

(1) The number of members in the association;
(2) If the association is an association of self-insured public
employers, the types of governmental services provided by the
members of the association;
(3) If the association is an association of self-insured private
employers, the classifications of employment of the members of the

recover the deficiency.

assigned to the member, the Commissioner shall order the
association to pay to the member the excess amount collected.

obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would

employers that pays compensation due to an employee who has a
permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin and incurs

substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the
preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than that which
would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone is entitled to
be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations
of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:

permanent physical impairment, any compensation paid is entitled
to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for
Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.

shall notify the Board of any possible claim against the Subsequent
