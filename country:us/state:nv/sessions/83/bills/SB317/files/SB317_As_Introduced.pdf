Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law authorizes the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the
5 Department of Business and Industry to order certain additional payments to a
6 claimant in the form of benefit penalties, if the Administrator determines that an
7 insurer, organization for managed care, health care provider, third-party
8 administrator, employer or professional employer organization has committed
9 certain violations. (NRS 616A.070, 616D.120) Sections 3 and 30 of this bill
10 additionally authorize the imposition of benefit penalties under certain
11 circumstances for: (1) failure to provide or unreasonably delaying payment to an
-
*SB317*

– 2 –
12 injured employee or reimbursement to an insurer; or (2) concealing, falsifying or
13 failing to provide certain evidence or documents before certain hearings which
14 would have been useful to an injured employee in seeking benefits or
15 compensation.
16 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
17 physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
18 panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
19 procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
20 physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
21 (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
22 the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; and (2) requires an
23 insurer to replace any physician or chiropractic physician who is removed from the
24 list within 60 days. Sections 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13 of this bill: (1) require an insurer to
25 keep a list of certain providers of health care other than a physician or chiropractic
26 physician, which section 1 of this bill designates as an “industrial provider of
27 health care,” from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment
28 from a panel established and maintained by the Administrator; and (2) establish
29 certain requirements and restrictions concerning the selection of such an industrial
30 provider of health care. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change so that
31 the definition of “industrial provider of health care” applies to the provisions of
32 existing law governing industrial insurance.
33 Section 8 of this bill authorizes a hearing officer or appeals officer of the
34 Hearings Division of the Department of Administration to order any needed
35 examination, assessment or treatment of an injured employee be conducted by any
36 physician, chiropractic physician or industrial provider of health care who will
37 accept the fee schedule adopted by the Administrator, whether located in this State
38 or another state, if the hearing or appeals officer finds that there is a lack of
39 physicians, chiropractic physicians or providers available. Section 9 of this bill
40 establishes certain requirements for the filing and service of certain evidence and
41 documents in advance of a hearing before a hearing officer or appeals officer.
42 Existing law requires a treating physician, chiropractic physician, physician
43 assistant or advanced practice registered nurse to complete and file a claim for
44 compensation within 3 working days after first providing treatment for an injured
45 employee, or delegate the duty to do so to a physician assistant or advanced
46 practice registered nurse at a medical facility. (NRS 616C.040, 616C.045) Sections
47 10 and 11 of this bill similarly authorize a treating physician, chiropractic
48 physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse to delegate the
49 duty to complete and file the claim for compensation to an industrial provider of
50 health care.
51 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
52 caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
53 the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
54 such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
55 employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
56 to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
57 elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)
58 Section 17 of this bill eliminates provisions that make such method of proof the
59 only method, with certain exceptions, by which an employee may prove that such
60 an injury arose in and out of the course of employment. Section 17 additionally
61 eliminates the standard of clear and convincing evidence and instead requires proof
62 by medical, psychological or psychiatric evidence.
63 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
64 Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
65 Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
66 officers and appeals officers.

*SB317*

– 3 –
67 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
68 under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
69 the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
70 grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.
71 Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
72 the decision of an appeals officer.
73 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
74 requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
75 after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
76 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill establishes the same requirements for payment
77 when a claim for a period of temporary partial disability is allowed.
78 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
79 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
80 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
81 of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
82 provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
83 discovery.
84 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
85 concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
86 616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
87 resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
88 made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
89 under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
90 (NRS 616C.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
91 and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
92 to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.

9 2. Every employer whose insurer has not entered into a
10 contract with an organization for managed care or with providers
11 of health care pursuant to NRS 616B.527 shall maintain a list of
12 those industrial providers of health care on the panel who are
13 reasonably accessible to his or her employees.
14 3. An injured employee whose employer’s insurer has not
15 entered into a contract with an organization for managed care or
16 with providers of health care pursuant to NRS 616B.527 may
17 choose an industrial provider of health care from the panel of
18 industrial providers of health care. If the injured employee is not
19 satisfied with the first industrial provider of health care he or she
20 so chooses, the injured employee may make an alternative choice
21 of industrial provider of health care from the panel if the choice is
22 made within 90 days after his or her injury. The insurer shall
23 notify the first industrial provider of health care in writing. The
24 notice must be postmarked within 3 working days after the insurer
25 receives knowledge of the change. The first industrial provider of
26 health care must be reimbursed only for the services the industrial
27 provider of health care rendered to the injured employee up to and
28 including the date of notification. Except as otherwise provided in
29 this subsection, any further change is subject to the approval of
30 the insurer or by order of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A
31 request for a change of industrial provider of health care must be
32 granted or denied within 10 days after a written request for such a
33 change is received from the injured employee. If the insurer takes
34 no action on the request within 10 days, the request shall be
35 deemed granted. Any request for a change of an industrial
36 provider of health care must include the name of the new
37 industrial provider of health care chosen by the injured employee.
38 If the industrial provider of health care refers the injured
39 employee to a specialist for treatment, the insurer shall provide to
40 the injured employee a list that includes the name of each
41 industrial provider of health care with that specialization who is
42 on the panel. Not later than 14 days after receiving the list, the
43 injured employee shall select an industrial provider of health care
44 from the list.

1 4. An injured employee whose employer’s insurer has entered
2 into a contract with an organization for managed care or with
3 providers of health care pursuant to NRS 616B.527 must choose
4 an industrial provider of health care pursuant to the terms of that
5 contract. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the first
6 industrial provider of health care he or she so chooses, the injured
7 employee may make an alternative choice of industrial provider of
8 health care pursuant to the terms of the contract without the
9 approval of the insurer if the choice is made within 90 days after
10 his or her injury. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
11 any further change is subject to the approval of the insurer or by
12 order of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A request for a
13 change of an industrial provider of health care must be granted or
14 denied within 10 days after a written request for such a change is
15 received from the injured employee. If the insurer takes no action
16 on the request within 10 days, the request shall be deemed
17 granted. If the injured employee, after choosing an industrial
18 provider of health care, moves to a county which is not served by
19 the organization for managed care or providers of health care
20 named in the contract and the insurer determines that it is
21 impractical for the injured employee to continue treatment with
22 the industrial provider of health care, the injured employee must
23 choose an industrial provider of health care who has agreed to the
24 terms of that contract unless the insurer authorizes the injured
25 employee to choose another industrial provider of health care. If
26 the industrial provider of health care refers the injured employee
27 to a specialist for treatment, the insurer shall provide to the
28 injured employee a list that includes the name of each industrial
29 provider of health care with that specialization who is available
30 pursuant to the terms of the contract with the organization for
31 managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
32 616B.527, as appropriate. Not later than 14 days after receiving
33 the list, the injured employee shall select an industrial provider of
34 health care. If the employee fails to select an industrial provider of
35 health care, the insurer may select an industrial provider of health
36 care with that specialization. If an industrial provider of health
37 care with that specialization is not available pursuant to the terms
38 of the contract, the organization for managed care or the provider
39 of health care may select an industrial provider of health care with
40 that specialization.
41 5. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the industrial
42 provider of health care selected by himself or herself or by the
43 insurer, the organization for managed care or the provider of
44 health care pursuant to subsection 4, the injured employee may
45 make an alternative choice of an industrial provider of health care
-

– 10 –
1 pursuant to the terms of the contract. A change in the industrial
2 provider of health care may be made at any time but is subject to
3 the approval of the insurer or by order of a hearing officer or
4 appeals officer. A request for a change of industrial provider of
5 health care must be granted or denied within 10 days after a
6 written request for such a change is received from the injured
7 employee. If no action is taken on the request within 10 days, the
8 request shall be deemed granted. Any request for a change of an
9 industrial provider of health care must include the name of the
10 new industrial provider of health care chosen by the injured
11 employee. If the insurer denies a request for a change in the
12 industrial provider of health care under this subsection, the
13 insurer must include in a written notice of denial to the injured
14 employee the specific reason for the denial of the request.
15 6. Except when emergency medical care is required and
16 except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.055, the insurer is not
17 responsible for any charges for medical treatment or other
18 accident benefits furnished or ordered by any industrial provider
19 of health care or other person selected by the injured employee in
20 disregard of the provisions of this section or for any compensation
21 for any aggravation of the injured employee’s injury attributable
22 to improper treatments by such industrial provider of health care
23 or other person.
24 7. The Administrator may order necessary changes in a panel
25 of industrial providers of health care and shall:
26 (a) Suspend or remove any industrial provider of health care
27 from a panel for good cause shown in accordance with section 6
28 of this act; and
29 (b) Remove from being included on a panel any industrial
30 provider of health care who does not accept and treat injured
31 employees for industrial injuries or occupational diseases.
32 8. Any interested person may notify the Administrator, on a
33 form prescribed by the Administrator, if the person believes that
34 an industrial provider of health care does not accept and treat
35 injured employees under chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
36 chapter 617 of NRS for industrial injuries or occupational
37 diseases.
38 9. If the Administrator receives notice pursuant to subsection
39 8, the Administrator shall:
40 (a) Conduct an investigation to determine whether the
41 industrial provider of health care may remain on the panel; and
42 (b) Publish or cause to be published on the Internet website of
43 the Division not later than 90 days after receiving the notice the
44 results of the investigation.

2 from a panel pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 7 may
3 request, on a form prescribed by the Administrator, to be
4 reinstated on a panel if the industrial provider of health care
5 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that he or she
6 accepts and treats injured employees.
7 11. An injured employee may receive treatment by more than
8 one industrial provider of health care:
9 (a) If the insurer provides written authorization for such
10 treatment; or
11 (b) By order of a hearing officer or appeals officer.
12 12. The Administrator shall design a form that notifies
13 injured employees of their right pursuant to subsections 3, 4 and 5
14 to select an alternative industrial provider of health care and make
15 the form available to insurers for distribution pursuant to
16 subsection 2 of NRS 616C.050.
17 Sec. 8. 1. Upon a finding of good cause in accordance with
18 subsection 2, a hearing officer or an appeals officer may order any
