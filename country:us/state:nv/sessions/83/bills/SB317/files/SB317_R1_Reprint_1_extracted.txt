Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Section
4 4.1 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of
5 the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before conducting certain
6 inspections at the physical office of an insurer or third-party administrator. For
7 purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the terms
8 of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the maximum amount
9 paid to any one employee for services provided during the 12-month period during
10 which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000. (NRS 616B.222) Section
11 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000 amount and instead deems the maximum
12 amount to be a calculation of the maximum average monthly wage using data
13 computed by the Employment Security Division of the Department of Employment,
14 Training and Rehabilitation.
15 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
16 insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
17 Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
18 the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
19 administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
20 requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
21 surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
22 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of
23 this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an
24 additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4
25 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure for terminating
26 liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
27 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
28 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires
29 money in the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
30 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
31 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
32 of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
33 disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
34 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Existing law and regulations
35 require associations of self-insured public or private employers to pay an annual
36 assessment which funds the Account. (NRS 616B.575; chapter 616B of NAC)
37 Section 4.5 of this bill removes the authority to adopt regulations which impose
38 such assessments from the Board for the Administration of the Subsequent Injury
39 Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers, and section
40 33.5 of this bill voids the provisions of existing regulations relating to such
41 assessments, thus eliminating the requirement for assessments to be paid for the
42 Account. Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this bill require an employee to have incurred a
43 subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30, 2025, in order for the
44 compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims
45 against the Account because of a subsequent disability by injury which is incurred
46 on or after October 1, 2025.
47 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
48 authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain
49 circumstances, to delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to
50 a physician assistant who is an employee of and under the supervision of the
51 physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the
52 Administrator to select a closed formulary that is required to be used by industrial
53 insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section
54 9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from providing reimbursement for a drug
-
*SB317_R1*
– 3 –
55 that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when use of the formulary is
56 required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal to a hearings officer any
57 determination denying a request for a drug which has been recommended as
58 medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming change relating
59 to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and determining if the
60 generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured employee.
61 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
62 physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
63 panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
64 procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
65 physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
66 (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
67 the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; (2) requires an
68 insurer to replace any physician or chiropractic physician who is removed from the
69 list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain audits and revisions of the insurer’s list;
70 and (4) revises certain filing requirements relating to the insurer’s list.
71 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
72 caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
73 the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
74 such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
75 employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
76 to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
77 elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)
78 Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and convincing medical,
79 psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer to
80 maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health
81 care from which an injured employee may choose.
82 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
83 Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
84 Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
85 officers and appeals officers.
86 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
87 under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
88 the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
89 grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.
90 Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
91 the decision of an appeals officer.
92 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
93 requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
94 after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
95 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill requires, for a period of temporary partial
96 disability, the first payment or a determination regarding payment to be issued
97 within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
98 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
99 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
100 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
101 of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
102 provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
103 discovery. Section 30 of this bill revises provisions relating to administrative fines
104 which the Administrator may impose for certain violations.
105 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
106 concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
107 616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
108 resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
109 made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
-
*SB317_R1*
– 4 –
110 under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
111 (NRS 616C.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
112 and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
113 to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.
114 Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
115 who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
116 employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law also requires the
117 Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each association of self-insured employers
118 to verify certain information. (NRS 616B.410) Section 34 repeals the requirement
119 that the Commissioner examine each association annually.

25 Sec. 4.3. NRS 616B.353 is hereby amended to read as follows:

12 termination does not limit liability that was incurred under the
13 surety bond before the termination.
14 Sec. 4.5. NRS 616B.575 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 616B.575 1. There is hereby created in the Fund for

23 2. All [assessments,] penalties, bonds, securities and all other
24 properties received, collected or acquired by the Board for the

28 3. All money and securities in the Account must be held by the
29 State Treasurer as custodian thereof to be used solely for workers’
30 compensation for employees of members of Associations of Self-
31 Insured Public or Private Employers.

33 Account [only upon] within 14 days after receiving a written order
34 of the Board.
35 5. The State Treasurer shall invest money of the Account in the

– 9 –
1 payments from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
2 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.]
3 7. [The Commissioner shall assign an actuary to review the

6 of self-insured public or private employers that wishes to appeal the
7 rate so filed must do so pursuant to NRS 679B.310.
8 8.] The Administrator shall:
9 (a) Evaluate any claim submitted to the Board for payment or

14 (b) Submit to the Board any other recommendations relating to

16 Sec. 4.6. NRS 616B.578 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 616B.578 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.581:
18 1. If an employee of a member of an association of self-insured
19 public or private employers has a permanent physical impairment
20 from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30,
21 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the
22 course of his or her employment which entitles the employee to
23 compensation for disability that is substantially greater by reason of
24 the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and the
25 subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
26 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
27 the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
28 Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted
29 by the Board.
30 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or
31 before September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is
32 determined that the death would not have occurred except for the
33 preexisting permanent physical impairment, the compensation due
34 must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations
35 of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with
36 regulations adopted by the Board.
37 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment”
38 means any permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by
39 injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or
40 obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
41 the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
42 condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
43 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of
44 the whole person if evaluated according to the American Medical
45 Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as
-
*SB317_R1*
– 10 –
1 adopted and supplemented by the Division pursuant to
2 NRS 616C.110.
3 4. To qualify under this section for reimbursement from the
4 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public
5 or Private Employers, the association of self-insured public or
6 private employers must establish by written records that the
7 employer had knowledge of the “permanent physical impairment” at
8 the time the employee was hired or that the employee was retained
9 in employment after the employer acquired such knowledge.
10 5. An association of self-insured public or private employers
11 must submit to the Board a claim for reimbursement from the
12 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public
13 or Private Employers.
14 6. The Board shall adopt regulations establishing procedures
15 for submitting claims against the Subsequent Injury Account for
16 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. The
17 Board shall notify the Association of Self-Insured Public or Private
18 Employers of its decision on such a claim within 120 days after the
19 claim is received.
20 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against
21 the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
22 Public or Private Employers must be submitted directly to the
23 district court.
24 Sec. 4.7. NRS 616B.581 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 616B.581 1. An association of self-insured public or private
26 employers that pays compensation due to an employee who has a
27 permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin and incurs
28 , on or before September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury
29 arising out of and in the course of his or her employment which
30 entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
31 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the
32 preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than that which
33 would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone is entitled to
34 be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations
35 of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:
36 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to
37 his or her physical condition at the time the employee was hired by
38 the member of the Association of Self-Insured Public or Private
39 Employers;
40 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this
41 reliance formed a substantial basis of the employment; and
42 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Section
4 4.1 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of
5 the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before conducting certain
6 inspections at the physical office of an insurer or third-party administrator. For
7 purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the terms
8 of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the maximum amount
9 paid to any one employee for services provided during the 12-month period during
10 which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000. (NRS 616B.222) Section
11 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000 amount and instead deems the maximum
12 amount to be a calculation of the maximum average monthly wage using data
13 computed by the Employment Security Division of the Department of Employment,
14 Training and Rehabilitation.
15 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
16 insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
17 Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
18 the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
19 administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
20 requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
21 surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
22 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of
23 this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an
24 additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4
25 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure for terminating
26 liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
27 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
28 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires
29 money in the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
30 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
31 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
32 of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
33 disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
34 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Existing law and regulations
35 require associations of self-insured public or private employers to pay an annual
36 assessment which funds the Account. (NRS 616B.575; chapter 616B of NAC)
37 Section 4.5 of this bill removes the authority to adopt regulations which impose
38 such assessments from the Board for the Administration of the Subsequent Injury
39 Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers, and section
40 33.5 of this bill voids the provisions of existing regulations relating to such
41 assessments, thus eliminating the requirement for assessments to be paid for the
42 Account. Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this bill require an employee to have incurred a
43 subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30, 2025, in order for the
44 compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims
45 against the Account because of a subsequent disability by injury which is incurred
46 on or after October 1, 2025.
47 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
48 authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain
49 circumstances, to delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to
50 a physician assistant who is an employee of and under the supervision of the
51 physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the
52 Administrator to select a closed formulary that is required to be used by industrial
53 insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section
54 9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from providing reimbursement for a drug
-
*SB317_R1*

– 3 –
55 that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when use of the formulary is
56 required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal to a hearings officer any
57 determination denying a request for a drug which has been recommended as
58 medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming change relating
59 to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and determining if the
60 generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured employee.
61 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
62 physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
63 panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
64 procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
65 physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
66 (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
67 the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; (2) requires an
68 insurer to replace any physician or chiropractic physician who is removed from the
69 list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain audits and revisions of the insurer’s list;
70 and (4) revises certain filing requirements relating to the insurer’s list.
71 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
72 caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
73 the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
74 such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
75 employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
76 to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
77 elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)
78 Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and convincing medical,
79 psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer to
80 maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health
81 care from which an injured employee may choose.
82 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
83 Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
84 Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
85 officers and appeals officers.
86 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
87 under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
88 the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
89 grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.
90 Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
91 the decision of an appeals officer.
92 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
93 requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
94 after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
95 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill requires, for a period of temporary partial
96 disability, the first payment or a determination regarding payment to be issued
97 within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
98 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
99 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
100 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
101 of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
102 provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
103 discovery. Section 30 of this bill revises provisions relating to administrative fines
104 which the Administrator may impose for certain violations.
105 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
106 concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
107 616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
108 resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
109 made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
-
*SB317_R1*

– 4 –
110 under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
111 (NRS 616C.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
112 and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
113 to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.
114 Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
115 who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
116 employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law also requires the
117 Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each association of self-insured employers
118 to verify certain information. (NRS 616B.410) Section 34 repeals the requirement
119 that the Commissioner examine each association annually.

13 2. The physical records in a file concerning a claim filed in this

8 similar format by an insurer.
9 5. This section does not require an insurer to allow inspection
10 or reproduction of material regarding which a legal privilege against
11 disclosure has been conferred.
12 Sec. 4.2. NRS 616B.222 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 616B.222 1. To determine the total amount paid to
14 employees for services performed, the maximum amount paid to
15 any one employee during a policy year shall be deemed to be
16 [$36,000.] an amount equal to 12 times the maximum average
17 monthly wage. On or before January 1 of each year, the
18 Administrator shall establish the amount of the maximum average
19 monthly wage to take effect on January 1 of that year.
20 2. As used in this section, “maximum average monthly wage”
21 means 150 percent of the state average weekly wage as most
22 recently computed by the Employment Security Division of the
23 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation,
24 multiplied by 4.33.
25 Sec. 4.3. NRS 616B.353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 616B.353 1. An association of self-insured public or private
27 employers shall:
28 (a) Execute an indemnity agreement jointly and severally
29 binding the association and each member of the association to
30 secure the payment of all compensation due pursuant to chapters
31 616A to 617, inclusive, of NRS. The indemnity agreement must be
32 in a form prescribed by the Commissioner. An association may add
33 provisions to the indemnity agreement if they are first approved by
34 the Commissioner.
35 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, maintain a
36 policy of specific and aggregate excess insurance in a form and
37 amount required by the Commissioner. The excess insurance must
38 be written by an insurer approved by the Commissioner. To
39 determine the amount of excess insurance required, the
40 Commissioner shall consider:
41 (1) The number of members in the association;
42 (2) If the association is an association of self-insured public
43 employers, the types of governmental services provided by the
44 members of the association;
-
*SB317_R1*

– 6 –
1 (3) If the association is an association of self-insured private
2 employers, the classifications of employment of the members of the
3 association;
4 (4) The number of years the association has been in
5 existence; and
6 (5) Such other information as the Commissioner deems
7 necessary.
8  Nothing in this paragraph prohibits an association from
9 purchasing secondary excess insurance in addition to the excess
10 insurance required by this paragraph.
11 (c) Collect an annual assessment from each member of the
12 association in an aggregate amount of at least $250,000 or in an
13 aggregate amount which the Commissioner determines is
14 satisfactory based on an annual review conducted by the
15 Commissioner of the actuarial solvency of the association.
16 (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e), deposit as
17 security with the Commissioner a bond executed by the association
18 as principal, and by a licensed surety, payable to the State of
19 Nevada, and conditioned upon the payment of compensation for
20 injuries and occupational diseases to their employees. The bond
21 must be in an amount determined by the Commissioner to be
22 reasonably sufficient to ensure payment of such compensation, but
23 in no event may it be less than $100,000.
24 (e) In lieu of a bond, deposit with the Commissioner a like
25 amount of lawful money of the United States or any other form of
26 security authorized by NRS 100.065. If security is provided in the
27 form of a savings certificate, certificate of deposit or investment
28 certificate, the certificate must state that the amount is unavailable
29 for withdrawal except upon order of the Commissioner.
30 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, in addition to
31 complying with the requirements of subsection 1, an association of
32 self-insured private employers shall:
33 (a) At the time of initial qualification and until the association
34 has operated successfully as a qualified association of self-insured
35 private employers for 3 years, as determined by the Commissioner,
36 have a combined tangible net worth of all members in the
37 association of at least $2,500,000, as evidenced by a statement of
38 tangible net worth provided to the Division of Insurance of the
39 Department of Business and Industry by an independent certified
40 public accountant; or
41 (b) After 3 years of successful operation as a qualified
42 association of self-insured private employers, as determined by the
43 Commissioner, have combined net cash flows from operating
44 activities plus net cash flows from financing activities of all
-
*SB317_R1*

– 7 –
1 members in the association of five times the average of claims paid
2 for each of the last 3 years or $7,500,000, whichever is less.
3 3. In lieu of complying with the requirements of subsection 2,
4 the association’s administrator shall ensure that a solvency bond, in
5 a form prescribed by the Commissioner and in an aggregate amount
6 of at least $2,500,000, is deposited with the Commissioner by the
7 association or members of the association on behalf of the
8 association.
9 4. The association’s administrator shall deposit with the
10 Commissioner a bond executed by the association’s administrator as
11 principal, and by a licensed surety, payable to the State of Nevada,
12 and conditioned upon the faithful performance of his or her duties.
13 The bond must be in an amount determined by the Commissioner.
14 5. [Any third-party administrator providing claims services for
15 the association shall deposit with the Commissioner a bond executed
16 by the third-party administrator as principal, and by a licensed
17 surety, payable to the State of Nevada, and conditioned upon the
18 faithful performance of its duties. The bond must be in an amount
19 determined by the Commissioner.
20 6.] The Commissioner may increase or decrease the amount of

18 1. If an employee of a member of an association of self-insured
19 public or private employers has a permanent physical impairment
20 from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30,
21 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the
22 course of his or her employment which entitles the employee to
23 compensation for disability that is substantially greater by reason of
24 the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and the
25 subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
26 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
27 the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
28 Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted
29 by the Board.
30 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or

29 arising out of and in the course of his or her employment which
30 entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
31 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the
32 preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than that which
33 would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone is entitled to
34 be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations
35 of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:
36 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to

39 Employers;
40 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this
