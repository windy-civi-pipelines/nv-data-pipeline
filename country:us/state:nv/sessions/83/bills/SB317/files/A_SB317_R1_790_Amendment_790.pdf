Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial insurance if,
2 during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a workplace accident or
3 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing law requires an insurer or its
4 third-party administrator to operate or maintain a physical office in this State for
5 certain purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027, 616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this
6 bill authorize a legal representative of the insurer or third-party administrator, as
7 applicable, to operate or maintain such an office. Section 4.1 [of this bill] also requires the
8 Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and
9 Industry to give notice before conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an
10 insurer , [or] third-party administrator [.] or other legal representative.

Senate Amendment No. 790 to Senate Bill No. 317 First Reprint Page 4
11 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the terms
12 of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the maximum amount paid to
13 any one employee for services provided during the 12-month period during which a policy is
14 effective shall be deemed to be $36,000. (NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates
15 the $36,000 amount and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation of the
16 maximum average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security Division
17 of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation.
18 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-insured
19 employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and
20 to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for the benefit of any person damaged by any
21 fraudulent act or conduct of the administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857)
22 Existing law also requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an
23 additional surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
24 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of this bill
25 eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an additional surety bond
26 relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4 of this bill makes a conforming
27 change to remove the procedure for terminating liability on the bond eliminated by section
28 4.3.
29 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
30 Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires money in the Account to
31 be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in situations where an employee who has a
32 preexisting permanent physical impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out
33 of and in the course of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the
34 combined disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
35 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) [Existing law and regulations require
36 associations of self-insured public or private employers to pay an annual assessment which
37 funds the Account. (NRS 616B.575; chapter 616B of NAC) Section 4.5 of this bill removes
38 the authority to adopt regulations which impose such assessments from the Board for the
39 Administration of the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or
40 Private Employers, and section 33.5 of this bill voids the provisions of existing regulations
41 relating to such assessments, thus eliminating the requirement for assessments to be paid for
42 the Account.] Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this bill require an employee to have incurred a
43 subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30, 2025, in order for the
44 compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the
45 Account because of a subsequent disability by injury which is incurred on or after October 1,
46 2025.
47 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which authorize
48 a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain circumstances, to delegate certain
49 routine follow-up care of an injured employee to a physician assistant who is an employee of
50 and under the supervision of the physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill
51 requires the Administrator to [select a closed formulary] adopt the Official Disability
52 Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is
53 required to be used by industrial insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for
54 outpatient use. Section 9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer , with certain exceptions, from
55 providing reimbursement for a drug that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when use
56 of the formulary is required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal to a hearings
57 officer any determination denying a request for a drug which has been recommended as
58 medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to existing
59 requirements for prescribing generic drugs and determining if the generic drug would not be
60 beneficial to the health of the injured employee.
61 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic physicians
62 from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a panel established
63 and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth procedures and limitations
64 governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS
65 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a
66 physician or chiropractic physician from the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in
67 existing law; (2) requires an insurer , under certain circumstances, to replace any physician
68 or chiropractic physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain

Senate Amendment No. 790 to Senate Bill No. 317 First Reprint Page 5
69 audits and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements relating to
70 the insurer’s list.
71 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is caused by
72 stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in the course of his or
73 her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which such an injury must be proven
74 to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. Under existing law, with certain
75 exceptions, such an injury is deemed to arise out of and in the course of employment only if
76 the employee proves certain elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric
77 evidence. (NRS 616C.180) Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and
78 convincing medical, psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer
79 to maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health care
80 from which an injured employee may choose.
81 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the Department of
82 Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the Internet website of the
83 Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing officers and appeals officers.
84 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances under
85 which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of a
86 hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may grant a motion to stay the
87 enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer. Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise
88 certain procedures for the judicial review of the decision of an appeals officer.
89 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law requires an
90 industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days after receipt of the initial
91 certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill
92 requires, for a period of temporary partial disability, the first payment or a determination
93 regarding payment to be issued within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
94 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
95 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the Nevada
96 Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29 of this bill prohibit
97 a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise provisions governing the
98 circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow discovery. Section 30 of this bill
99 revises provisions relating to administrative fines which the Administrator may impose for
100 certain violations.
101 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination concerning
102 accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS 616C.305) Existing law
103 requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability resulting from occupational
104 disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be made jointly by the attending physician
105 and examining physician of a claimant, or, under certain circumstances, a designated third
106 physician or panel of physicians. (NRS [616C.459)] 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals
107 those procedures and requirements, and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill
108 make conforming changes to remove references to those procedures and requirements from
109 existing law. Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all
110 insurers who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
111 employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law also requires the Commissioner, at least
112 annually, to audit each association of self-insured employers to verify certain information.
113 (NRS 616B.410) Section 34 repeals the requirement that the Commissioner examine each
114 association annually.

23 due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-
24 Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted by the
25 Board.
26 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or before

37 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of the whole person
38 if evaluated according to the American Medical Association’s Guides to the
39 Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as adopted and supplemented by the Division
40 pursuant to NRS 616C.110.

51 claims against the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
52 Public or Private Employers. The Board shall notify the Association of Self-Insured

Senate Amendment No. 790 to Senate Bill No. 317 First Reprint Page 11
1 Public or Private Employers of its decision on such a claim within 120 days after
2 the claim is received.
3 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against the Subsequent
4 Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers must
5 be submitted directly to the district court.

10 subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of his or her
11 employment which entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
12 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting
13 impairment and the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
14 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury
15 Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:

19 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this reliance formed
20 a substantial basis of the employment; and
21 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation and the
22 subsequent disability.
23  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before September 30,
24 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined that the death would not have
25 occurred except for the preexisting permanent physical impairment, any
26 compensation paid is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account
27 for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.
28 2. An association of self-insured public or private employers shall notify the
29 Board of any possible claim against the Subsequent Injury Account for
30 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers pursuant to this section
31 no later than 60 days after the date of the subsequent injury or the date the employer
32 learns of the employee’s false representation, whichever is later.
