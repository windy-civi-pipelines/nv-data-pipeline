Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law requires an insurer or its third-party administrator to operate or maintain a
5 physical office in this State for certain purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027,
6 616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this bill authorize a legal representative
7 of the insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, to operate or maintain such
8 an office. Section 4.1 also requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial
9 Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before
10 conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an insurer, third-party
11 administrator or other legal representative.
12 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
13 the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
14 maximum amount paid to any one employee for services provided during the 12-
15 month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
16 (NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates the $36,000 amount and instead
17 deems the maximum amount to be a calculation of the maximum average monthly
18 wage using data computed by the Employment Security Division of the Department
19 of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation.
20 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
21 insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
22 Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
23 the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
24 administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
25 requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
26 surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
27 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of
28 this bill eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an
29 additional surety bond relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4
30 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove the procedure for terminating
31 liability on the bond eliminated by section 4.3.
32 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
33 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires
34 money in the Account to be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
35 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
36 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
37 of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
38 disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
39 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this
40 bill require an employee to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or
41 before September 30, 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement
42 provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the Account because of a
43 subsequent disability by injury which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.
44 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which
45 authorize a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain
46 circumstances, to delegate certain routine follow-up care of an injured employee to
47 a physician assistant who is an employee of and under the supervision of the
48 physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill requires the
49 Administrator to adopt the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary
50 published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is required to be used by industrial
51 insurers for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section
52 9.7 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer, with certain exceptions, from providing
53 reimbursement for a drug that is not listed and approved on the formulary, when
54 use of the formulary is required; and (2) authorizes an injured employee to appeal
-
*SB317_R2*

– 3 –
55 to a hearings officer any determination denying a request for a drug which has been
56 recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this bill makes a conforming
57 change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs and
58 determining if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured
59 employee.
60 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic
61 physicians from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a
62 panel established and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth
63 procedures and limitations governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic
64 physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill:
65 (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a physician or chiropractic physician from
66 the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in existing law; (2) requires an
67 insurer, under certain circumstances, to replace any physician or chiropractic
68 physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain audits
69 and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements
70 relating to the insurer’s list.
71 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is
72 caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in
73 the course of his or her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which
74 such an injury must be proven to have arisen out of and in the course of the
75 employment. Under existing law, with certain exceptions, such an injury is deemed
76 to arise out of and in the course of employment only if the employee proves certain
77 elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric evidence. (NRS 616C.180)
78 Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and convincing medical,
79 psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer to
80 maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health
81 care from which an injured employee may choose.
82 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the
83 Department of Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the
84 Internet website of the Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing
85 officers and appeals officers.
86 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances
87 under which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of
88 the decision of a hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may
89 grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer.
90 Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise certain procedures for the judicial review of
91 the decision of an appeals officer.
92 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law
93 requires an industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days
94 after receipt of the initial certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS
95 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill requires, for a period of temporary partial
96 disability, the first payment or a determination regarding payment to be issued
97 within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
98 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
99 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the
100 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29
101 of this bill prohibit a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise
102 provisions governing the circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow
103 discovery. Section 30 of this bill revises provisions relating to administrative fines
104 which the Administrator may impose for certain violations.
105 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination
106 concerning accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS
107 616C.305) Existing law requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability
108 resulting from occupational disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be
109 made jointly by the attending physician and examining physician of a claimant, or,
-
*SB317_R2*

– 4 –
110 under certain circumstances, a designated third physician or panel of physicians.
111 (NRS 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those procedures and requirements,
112 and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes
113 to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing law.
114 Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers
115 who provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured
116 employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law also requires the
117 Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each association of self-insured employers
118 to verify certain information. (NRS 616B.410) Section 34 repeals the requirement
119 that the Commissioner examine each association annually.

23 1. If an employee of a member of an association of self-insured
24 public or private employers has a permanent physical impairment
25 from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30,
26 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the
27 course of his or her employment which entitles the employee to
28 compensation for disability that is substantially greater by reason of
29 the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and the
30 subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
31 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
32 the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
33 Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted
34 by the Board.
35 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or
36 before September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is

32 permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin and incurs
33 , on or before September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury
34 arising out of and in the course of his or her employment which
35 entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
36 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the
37 preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than that which
38 would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone is entitled to
39 be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations

9 to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for
10 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.
11 2. An association of self-insured public or private employers
12 shall notify the Board of any possible claim against the Subsequent
13 Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private
