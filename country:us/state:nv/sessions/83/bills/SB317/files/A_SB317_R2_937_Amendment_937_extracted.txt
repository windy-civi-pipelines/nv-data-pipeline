Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial insurance if,
2 during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a workplace accident or
3 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing law requires an insurer or its
4 third-party administrator to operate or maintain a physical office in this State for certain
5 purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027, 616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this bill
6 authorize a legal representative of the insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, to
7 operate or maintain such an office. Section 4.1 also requires the Administrator of the Division
Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 4
8 of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before
9 conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an insurer, third-party administrator or
10 other legal representative. Section 4.15 also: (1) authorizes certain information to be
11 provided as an electronic copy or in an electronic format upon request; and (2) revises
12 certain requirements for availability to communicate with a claimant or representative
13 of the claimant if a private carrier or third-party administrator operates an office in this
14 State.
15 Existing law authorizes certain persons to administer certain claims from a location
16 in or outside of this State. (NRS 616B.0275) Section 4.17 of this bill additionally
17 authorizes certain self-insured private employers and certain entities associated with the
18 employer to administer certain claims from a location in or outside of this State if the
19 total aggregate number of employees of the employer and associated entities is 30,000 or
20 more.
21 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the terms
22 of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the maximum amount paid to
23 any one employee for services provided during the 12-month period during which a policy is
24 effective shall be deemed to be $36,000. (NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates
25 the $36,000 amount for an employer other than the State of Nevada or any agency or
26 political subdivision of the State and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation
27 of the maximum average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security
28 Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Section 4.2
29 authorizes the State or any agency or political subdivision of the State to elect to be
30 subject to the calculation used by other employers, in accordance with any procedures
31 established by the Administrator for the making of such an election.
32 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-insured
33 employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and
34 to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for the benefit of any person damaged by any
35 fraudulent act or conduct of the administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857)
36 Existing law also requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an
37 additional surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
38 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of this bill
39 eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an additional surety bond
40 relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4 of this bill makes a conforming
41 change to remove the procedure for terminating liability on the bond eliminated by section
42 4.3.
43 Existing law requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each association
44 of self-insured public or private employers to verify certain information, including the
45 standard industrial classification of each member of the association. (NRS 616B.410)
46 Section 4.37 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Commissioner to require each
47 association, at least annually, to audit the payroll of each member of the association to
48 verify certain information including the classification or classifications, rather than the
49 standard industrial classification, of each member; and (2) authorizes the Commissioner
50 to require the submission of a report summarizing the results of such an audit. Section
51 4.33 of this bill similarly removes a reference to the standard industrial classification of a
52 member of an association of self-insured public or private employers.
53 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
54 Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires money in the Account to
55 be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in situations where an employee who has a
56 preexisting permanent physical impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out
57 of and in the course of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the
58 combined disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
59 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this bill require
60 an employee to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30,
61 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, thus prohibiting
62 any claims against the Account because of a subsequent disability by injury which is incurred
63 on or after October 1, 2025.
64 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which authorize
65 a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain circumstances, to delegate certain
66 routine follow-up care of an injured employee to a physician assistant who is an employee of
Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 5
67 and under the supervision of the physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill
68 requires the Administrator to adopt the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary
69 published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is required to be used by industrial insurers
70 for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section 9.7 of this bill: (1)
71 prohibits an insurer, with certain exceptions, from providing reimbursement for a drug that is
72 not listed and approved on the formulary, when use of the formulary is required; and (2)
73 authorizes an injured employee to appeal to a hearings officer any determination denying a
74 request for a drug which has been recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this
75 bill makes a conforming change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs
76 and determining if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured
77 employee.
78 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic physicians
79 from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a panel established
80 and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth procedures and limitations
81 governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS
82 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a
83 physician or chiropractic physician from the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in
84 existing law; (2) requires an insurer, under certain circumstances, to replace any physician or
85 chiropractic physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain
86 audits and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements relating to
87 the insurer’s list.
88 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is caused by
89 stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in the course of his or
90 her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which such an injury must be proven
91 to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. Under existing law, with certain
92 exceptions, such an injury is deemed to arise out of and in the course of employment only if
93 the employee proves certain elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric
94 evidence. (NRS 616C.180) Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and
95 convincing medical, psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer
96 to maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health care
97 from which an injured employee may choose.
98 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the Department of
99 Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the Internet website of the
100 Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing officers and appeals officers.
101 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances under
102 which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of a
103 hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may grant a motion to stay the
104 enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer. Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise
105 certain procedures for the judicial review of the decision of an appeals officer.
106 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law requires an
107 industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days after receipt of the initial
108 certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill
109 requires, for a period of temporary partial disability, the first payment or a determination
110 regarding payment to be issued within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
111 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
112 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the Nevada
113 Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29 of this bill prohibit
114 a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise provisions governing the
115 circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow discovery. Section 30 of this bill
116 revises provisions relating to administrative fines which the Administrator may impose for
117 certain violations.
118 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination concerning
119 accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS 616C.305) Existing law
120 requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability resulting from occupational
121 disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be made jointly by the attending physician
122 and examining physician of a claimant, or, under certain circumstances, a designated third
123 physician or panel of physicians. (NRS 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those
124 procedures and requirements, and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make
125 conforming changes to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing
Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 6
126 law. Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers who
127 provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured employers. (NRS
128 616A.270, 616B.003) [Existing law also requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit
129 each association of self-insured employers to verify certain information. (NRS 616B.410)
130 Section 34 repeals the requirement that the Commissioner examine each association annually.]

15 employed by the State of Nevada or any agency or political subdivision of the
16 State, $36,000.
17 (b) For an employee other than an employee described in paragraph (a), an
18 amount equal to 12 times the maximum average monthly wage. On or before
19 January 1 of each year, the Administrator shall establish the amount of the

21 2. The State of Nevada or any agency or political subdivision of the State
22 may elect to be subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 in
23 accordance with any procedures that may be established by the Administrator for
24 the making of such an election.
25 3. As used in this section, “maximum average monthly wage” means 150
26 percent of the state average weekly wage as most recently computed by the
27 Employment Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and
28 Rehabilitation, multiplied by 4.33.
29 Sec. 4.3. NRS 616B.353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 616B.353 1. An association of self-insured public or private employers

32 (a) Execute an indemnity agreement jointly and severally binding the
33 association and each member of the association to secure the payment of all
34 compensation due pursuant to chapters 616A to 617, inclusive, of NRS. The

37 approved by the Commissioner.
38 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, maintain a policy of
39 specific and aggregate excess insurance in a form and amount required by the
40 Commissioner. The excess insurance must be written by an insurer approved by the
41 Commissioner. To determine the amount of excess insurance required, the
42 Commissioner shall consider:
43 (1) The number of members in the association;
44 (2) If the association is an association of self-insured public employers, the
45 types of governmental services provided by the members of the association;
46 (3) If the association is an association of self-insured private employers,
47 the classifications of employment of the members of the association;
48 (4) The number of years the association has been in existence; and
49 (5) Such other information as the Commissioner deems necessary.
50  Nothing in this paragraph prohibits an association from purchasing secondary
51 excess insurance in addition to the excess insurance required by this paragraph.
52 (c) Collect an annual assessment from each member of the association in an
53 aggregate amount of at least $250,000 or in an aggregate amount which the

3 (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e), deposit as security with the

9 $100,000.
10 (e) In lieu of a bond, deposit with the Commissioner a like amount of lawful
11 money of the United States or any other form of security authorized by NRS

13 deposit or investment certificate, the certificate must state that the amount is
14 unavailable for withdrawal except upon order of the Commissioner.
15 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, in addition to complying
16 with the requirements of subsection 1, an association of self-insured private
17 employers shall:

19 successfully as a qualified association of self-insured private employers for 3 years,
20 as determined by the Commissioner, have a combined tangible net worth of all
21 members in the association of at least $2,500,000, as evidenced by a statement of
22 tangible net worth provided to the Division of Insurance of the Department of
23 Business and Industry by an independent certified public accountant; or
24 (b) After 3 years of successful operation as a qualified association of self-
25 insured private employers, as determined by the Commissioner, have combined net

27 all members in the association of five times the average of claims paid for each of
28 the last 3 years or $7,500,000, whichever is less.
29 3. In lieu of complying with the requirements of subsection 2, the
30 association’s administrator shall ensure that a solvency bond, in a form prescribed
31 by the Commissioner and in an aggregate amount of at least $2,500,000, is
32 deposited with the Commissioner by the association or members of the association
33 on behalf of the association.
34 4. The association’s administrator shall deposit with the Commissioner a
35 bond executed by the association’s administrator as principal, and by a licensed
36 surety, payable to the State of Nevada, and conditioned upon the faithful
37 performance of his or her duties. The bond must be in an amount determined by the
38 Commissioner.
39 5. [Any third-party administrator providing claims services for the association
40 shall deposit with the Commissioner a bond executed by the third-party

43 amount determined by the Commissioner.
44 6.] The Commissioner may increase or decrease the amount of any bond or
45 money required to be deposited by this section in accordance with chapter 681B of
46 NRS and the Commissioner’s regulations for loss reserves in casualty insurance. If
47 the Commissioner requires an association [,] or association’s administrator [or
48 third-party administrator] to increase its deposit, the Commissioner may specify the
49 form of the additional security. The association [,] or association’s administrator [or

16 due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-
17 Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted by the

2 subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of his or her

5 impairment and the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
6 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury
7 Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:

11 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this reliance formed
12 a substantial basis of the employment; and

16 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined that the death would not have
17 occurred except for the preexisting permanent physical impairment, any

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial insurance if,
2 during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a workplace accident or
3 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing law requires an insurer or its
4 third-party administrator to operate or maintain a physical office in this State for certain
5 purposes. (NRS 616B.021, 616B.027, 616B.500) Sections 4.1, 4.15 and 4.45 of this bill
6 authorize a legal representative of the insurer or third-party administrator, as applicable, to
7 operate or maintain such an office. Section 4.1 also requires the Administrator of the Division

Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 4
8 of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to give notice before
9 conducting certain inspections at the physical office of an insurer, third-party administrator or
10 other legal representative. Section 4.15 also: (1) authorizes certain information to be
11 provided as an electronic copy or in an electronic format upon request; and (2) revises
12 certain requirements for availability to communicate with a claimant or representative
13 of the claimant if a private carrier or third-party administrator operates an office in this
14 State.
15 Existing law authorizes certain persons to administer certain claims from a location
16 in or outside of this State. (NRS 616B.0275) Section 4.17 of this bill additionally
17 authorizes certain self-insured private employers and certain entities associated with the
18 employer to administer certain claims from a location in or outside of this State if the
19 total aggregate number of employees of the employer and associated entities is 30,000 or
20 more.
21 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the terms
22 of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the maximum amount paid to
23 any one employee for services provided during the 12-month period during which a policy is
24 effective shall be deemed to be $36,000. (NRS 616B.222) Section 4.2 of this bill eliminates
25 the $36,000 amount for an employer other than the State of Nevada or any agency or
26 political subdivision of the State and instead deems the maximum amount to be a calculation
27 of the maximum average monthly wage using data computed by the Employment Security
28 Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. Section 4.2
29 authorizes the State or any agency or political subdivision of the State to elect to be
30 subject to the calculation used by other employers, in accordance with any procedures
31 established by the Administrator for the making of such an election.
32 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-insured
33 employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and
34 to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for the benefit of any person damaged by any
35 fraudulent act or conduct of the administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857)
36 Existing law also requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an
37 additional surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
38 particular association of self-insured employers. (NRS 616B.353) Section 4.3 of this bill
39 eliminates the requirement for a third-party administrator to file an additional surety bond
40 relative to its duties to a particular association. Section 4.4 of this bill makes a conforming
41 change to remove the procedure for terminating liability on the bond eliminated by section
42 4.3.
43 Existing law requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit each association
44 of self-insured public or private employers to verify certain information, including the
45 standard industrial classification of each member of the association. (NRS 616B.410)
46 Section 4.37 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Commissioner to require each
47 association, at least annually, to audit the payroll of each member of the association to
48 verify certain information including the classification or classifications, rather than the
49 standard industrial classification, of each member; and (2) authorizes the Commissioner
50 to require the submission of a report summarizing the results of such an audit. Section
51 4.33 of this bill similarly removes a reference to the standard industrial classification of a
52 member of an association of self-insured public or private employers.
53 Existing law establishes the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
54 Public or Private Employers. (NRS 616B.575) Existing law requires money in the Account to
55 be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in situations where an employee who has a
56 preexisting permanent physical impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out
57 of and in the course of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the
58 combined disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
59 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.563-616B.581) Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of this bill require
60 an employee to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30,
61 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, thus prohibiting
62 any claims against the Account because of a subsequent disability by injury which is incurred
63 on or after October 1, 2025.
64 Section 9.3 of this bill authorizes the Administrator to adopt regulations which authorize
65 a treating physician or chiropractic physician, under certain circumstances, to delegate certain
66 routine follow-up care of an injured employee to a physician assistant who is an employee of

Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 5
67 and under the supervision of the physician or chiropractic physician. Section 9.5 of this bill
68 requires the Administrator to adopt the Official Disability Guidelines (ODG) Drug Formulary
69 published by MCG Health, or its successor, that is required to be used by industrial insurers
70 for any drug which is prescribed and dispensed for outpatient use. Section 9.7 of this bill: (1)
71 prohibits an insurer, with certain exceptions, from providing reimbursement for a drug that is
72 not listed and approved on the formulary, when use of the formulary is required; and (2)
73 authorizes an injured employee to appeal to a hearings officer any determination denying a
74 request for a drug which has been recommended as medically necessary. Section 15.5 of this
75 bill makes a conforming change relating to existing requirements for prescribing generic drugs
76 and determining if the generic drug would not be beneficial to the health of the injured
77 employee.
78 Existing law requires an insurer to keep a list of physicians and chiropractic physicians
79 from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment from a panel established
80 and maintained by the Administrator. Existing law also sets forth procedures and limitations
81 governing the removal of a physician or chiropractic physician from an insurer’s list. (NRS
82 616C.087, 616C.090) Section 14 of this bill: (1) prohibits an insurer from removing a
83 physician or chiropractic physician from the insurer’s list except as expressly provided in
84 existing law; (2) requires an insurer, under certain circumstances, to replace any physician or
85 chiropractic physician who is removed from the list within 60 days; (3) authorizes certain
86 audits and revisions of the insurer’s list; and (4) revises certain filing requirements relating to
87 the insurer’s list.
88 Existing law provides that an injury or disease sustained by an employee that is caused by
89 stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it arose out of and in the course of his or
90 her employment. Existing law sets forth the manner by which such an injury must be proven
91 to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment. Under existing law, with certain
92 exceptions, such an injury is deemed to arise out of and in the course of employment only if
93 the employee proves certain elements by clear and convincing medical or psychiatric
94 evidence. (NRS 616C.180) Section 17 of this bill instead requires proof by clear and
95 convincing medical, psychological or psychiatric evidence. Section 17 also requires an insurer
96 to maintain and submit to the Administrator a list of certain providers of mental health care
97 from which an injured employee may choose.
98 Section 20 of this bill requires the Chief of the Hearings Division of the Department of
99 Administration to maintain and make accessible to the public on the Internet website of the
100 Division, a calendar of all matters which are before hearing officers and appeals officers.
101 Sections 23 and 25 of this bill revise provisions governing the circumstances under
102 which: (1) an appeals officer may grant a motion to stay the enforcement of the decision of a
103 hearing officer; and (2) an appeals officer or district court may grant a motion to stay the
104 enforcement of the decision of an appeals officer. Sections 24 and 32 of this bill revise
105 certain procedures for the judicial review of the decision of an appeals officer.
106 If a claim for a period of temporary total disability is allowed, existing law requires an
107 industrial insurer to make the first payment within 14 working days after receipt of the initial
108 certification of disability, and regularly thereafter. (NRS 616C.475) Section 27 of this bill
109 requires, for a period of temporary partial disability, the first payment or a determination
110 regarding payment to be issued within 14 working days after the insurer receives the claim.
111 Existing law authorizes hearing officers and appeals officers, under certain
112 circumstances, to allow discovery by deposition or interrogatories according to the Nevada
113 Rules of Civil Procedure. (NRS 616D.050, 616D.090) Sections 28 and 29 of this bill prohibit
114 a hearing officer from allowing such discovery, and revise provisions governing the
115 circumstances under which an appeals officer may allow discovery. Section 30 of this bill
116 revises provisions relating to administrative fines which the Administrator may impose for
117 certain violations.
118 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for appealing a final determination concerning
119 accident benefits made by an organization for managed care. (NRS 616C.305) Existing law
120 requires, for a determination of the percentage of disability resulting from occupational
121 disease of the heart or lungs, that the determination be made jointly by the attending physician
122 and examining physician of a claimant, or, under certain circumstances, a designated third
123 physician or panel of physicians. (NRS 617.459) Section 34 of this bill repeals those
124 procedures and requirements, and sections 15, 16, 18, 19, 21-23, 26 and 31 of this bill make
125 conforming changes to remove references to those procedures and requirements from existing

Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 6
126 law. Existing law requires the Administrator, at least every 5 years, to audit all insurers who
127 provide benefits to injured employees, including associations of self-insured employers. (NRS
128 616A.270, 616B.003) [Existing law also requires the Commissioner, at least annually, to audit
129 each association of self-insured employers to verify certain information. (NRS 616B.410)
130 Section 34 repeals the requirement that the Commissioner examine each association annually.]

16 due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-
17 Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted by the
18 Board.
19 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or before
20 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined that the death

22 the compensation due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for
23 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with
24 regulations adopted by the Board.
25 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment” means any
26 permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by injury or disease, of such

Assembly Amendment No. 937 to Senate Bill No. 317 Second Reprint Page 13
1 from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30, 2025, a
2 subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of his or her
3 employment which entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
4 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting
5 impairment and the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
6 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury
7 Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:

9 physical condition at the time the employee was hired by the member of the
10 Association of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers;
11 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this reliance formed
12 a substantial basis of the employment; and
13 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation and the
14 subsequent disability.
15  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before September 30,
16 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined that the death would not have
17 occurred except for the preexisting permanent physical impairment, any
18 compensation paid is entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account
19 for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.
20 2. An association of self-insured public or private employers shall notify the
21 Board of any possible claim against the Subsequent Injury Account for
22 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers pursuant to this section
