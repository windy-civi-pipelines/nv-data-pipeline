13 710.159, 711.600, and section 13 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
14 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
15 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
16 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
17 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
18 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
19 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
20 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
21 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
22 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
23 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
24 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
25 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
26 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
27 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
28 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
29 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
30 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
31 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
32 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
33 record that is not otherwise confidential.
34 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
35 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
36 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
37 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
38 (a) The public record:
39 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
40 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
41 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
42 electronic medium would:
43 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
44 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
45 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
46 otherwise confidential.
47 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
48 custody or control of a public record:
49 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
50 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
51 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.

Assembly Amendment No. 446 to Assembly Bill No. 378 Page 11
1 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare

3 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

5 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
6 the Legislature.
7 Sec. 19. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
8 2. Sections 1 to 18, inclusive, of this act become effective:
9 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purposes of adopting regulations and
10 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks; and
