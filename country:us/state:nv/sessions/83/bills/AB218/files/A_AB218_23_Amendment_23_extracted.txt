2 of whether a person who is issued a civil infraction citation agrees to receive communications
3 by text message; and (2) authorizes a court to send certain communications relating to civil
4 infraction citations by text message. (NRS 484A.7035, 484A.704) [Colorado law requires: (1)

22 issued certain citations or arrested to provide a telephone number for purposes of receiving
23 certain communications by text message.] This bill requests that the Nevada Supreme
