20 (c) Unless it is impracticable or inadvisable or has been
21 otherwise ordered by the juvenile court, the child must be released
22 to the custody of a parent or guardian or another responsible adult
23 who has signed a written agreement to bring the child before the
24 juvenile court at a time stated in the agreement or as the juvenile
25 court may direct. The written agreement must include the
26 telephone number of the child and an indication as to whether the
27 child has agreed to receive communications relating to
28 the juvenile court. The written agreement must be submitted to the
29 juvenile court as soon as possible. If the person fails to produce the
30 child at the time stated in the agreement or upon a summons from
31 the juvenile court, a writ may be issued for the attachment of the
32 person or of the child requiring that the person or child, or both, be
33 brought before the juvenile court at a time stated in the writ.
34 3. If a child who is taken into custody is not released pursuant
35 to subsection 2:
36 (a) The child must be taken without unnecessary delay to:
37 (1) The juvenile court; or
38 (2) The place of detention designated by the juvenile court
39 and, as soon as possible thereafter, the fact of detention must be
40 reported to the juvenile court; and
41 (b) Pending further disposition of the case, the juvenile court
42 may order that the child be:
43 (1) Released to the custody of a parent or guardian or another
44 person appointed by the juvenile court;

2 subject to further order of the juvenile court; or
3 (3) Conditionally released for supervised detention at the
4 home of the child in lieu of detention at a facility for the detention
5 of children. The supervised detention at the home of the child may
6 include electronic surveillance of the child.
7 4. In determining whether to release a child pursuant to this
8 section to a person other than a parent or guardian, the juvenile court
9 shall give preference to any person who is related to the child within
10 the fifth degree of consanguinity if the juvenile court finds that the
11 person is suitable and able to provide proper care and guidance for
12 the child.

22 arresting officer;
23 (c) When the person is found and the arrest is made in a public
24 place or a place that is open to the public and:
25 (1) There is a warrant of arrest against the person; and
26 (2) The misdemeanor is discovered because there was
27 probable cause for the arresting officer to stop, detain or arrest the
28 person for another alleged violation or offense;
29 (d) When the offense is committed in the presence of a private
30 person and the person makes an arrest immediately after the offense
31 is committed;
32 (e) When the arrest is made in the manner provided in NRS
33 171.137 or 171.1375;
34 (f) When the person is already in custody as a result of another
35 lawful arrest; or
36 (g) When the person voluntarily surrenders himself or herself in
37 response to an outstanding warrant of arrest.
38 3. At the time of the arrest, the person making the arrest shall
39 obtain the telephone number of the person who is arrested and an
40 indication as to whether the person has agreed to receive
41 communications from the court by text message.
42 Sec. 4. NRS 171.1773 is hereby amended to read as follows:
