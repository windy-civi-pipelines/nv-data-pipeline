AN ACT relating to water; creating the Fund for Hydrological
Studies to make grants of money for hydrological studies
in certain counties; revising provisions governing the
payment of the cost of a hydrological study required by
the State Engineer in certain counties; making an
appropriation to the Fund to be used for such grants of
money; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to require a hydrological,
2 environmental or any other study be conducted before the State Engineer approves
3 or rejects an application to apply water to beneficial use if such a study has not
4 been conducted by the applicant, a governmental agency or other person or the
5 study is not available; and (2) requires the applicant to bear the full cost of the
6 study. (NRS 533.368, 533.370) Any money collected from the applicant to perform
7 the study is required under existing law to be deposited in the Account for Studies
8 Concerning Water and used to defray the costs of conducting these studies and
9 certain inventories. (NRS 533.369)
10 Section 1 of this bill creates a Fund for Hydrological Studies and, with certain
11 exceptions, requires, for a hydrological study which is required by the State
12 Engineer to be conducted in a county whose population is less than 100,000
13 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties): (1) an applicant to
14 pay a deposit to defray 50 percent of the cost of such a study; and (2) the State
15 Engineer to make a grant of money from the Fund equal to the amount deposited by
16 the applicant to defray the remaining 50 percent of the cost of such a study. Section
17 1 further requires, if there is insufficient money in the Fund to make such a grant of
18 money, the State Engineer to make a grant of money from the Account for Studies
19 Concerning Water to cover the remaining costs. If the Account also has insufficient
20 money to cover the remaining amount, section 1 authorizes the applicant to: (1) pay
21 a cash deposit to the State Engineer in an amount sufficient to defray the remaining

22 cost of the study; or (2) withdraw his or her application and receive a refund of any
23 money deposited pursuant to the provisions of section 1. Finally, section 1 sets
24 forth procedures governing the use of money deposited in the Fund and requires
25 that any money paid by an applicant or the State Engineer that exceeds the amount
26 required to conduct the study be refunded to the applicant, the Fund or Account in
27 an amount which is proportional to the deposits contributed by the applicant or the
28 State Engineer.
29 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the State Engineer to adopt regulations to carry
30 out the provisions of section 1 and makes a conforming change to reflect the
31 changes made by section 1 to the requirements for the defrayment of the cost of
32 certain hydrological studies. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to
33 reflect the use of money in the Account for such studies.
34 Section 4 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Fund for grants of money
35 required to be made by the State Engineer pursuant to section 1.
