EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil liability; providing immunity from civil
liability to certain persons authorized to provide certain
care pursuant to an agreement between a hospital and the
Armed Forces of the United States; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a hospital to enter into an agreement with the Armed
2 Forces of the United States for the provision of certain care under certain
3 circumstances. (NRS 449.2455) Under existing law, an immune contractor of the
4 State or any of its agencies or political subdivisions is immune from civil liability
5 for certain acts or omissions of the contractor. (NRS 41.032) This bill revises the
6 applicable definition of “immune contractor” to include any person authorized to
7 provide care pursuant to an agreement between a hospital and the Armed Forces of
8 the United States. This bill thereby makes a person authorized to provide care
9 pursuant to any such agreement immune from civil liability for certain acts or
10 omissions of the person.
