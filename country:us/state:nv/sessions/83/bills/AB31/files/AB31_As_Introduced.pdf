AN ACT relating to Medicaid; providing for certain reimbursement

matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, through
2 the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department, to administer
3 Medicaid. (NRS 422.2357, 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of
4 the Department to include under Medicaid a requirement that providers of
5 nonemergency secure behavioral health transport services that are covered by
6 Medicaid be reimbursed for certain distances traveled while going to pick up or
7 returning from dropping off a patient. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming
8 change to require the Director to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same
9 manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid. Section 3 of this bill
10 requires the Director to apply for any federal authority that is necessary to increase
11 by: (1) at least 15 percent the rate of reimbursement for nonemergency secure
12 behavioral health transport services covered by Medicaid when the pick-up location
13 or drop-off location, or both, are located in a county whose population is less than
14 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties); and (2) at
15 least 10 percent for all other nonemergency secure behavioral health transport
16 services covered by Medicaid.
