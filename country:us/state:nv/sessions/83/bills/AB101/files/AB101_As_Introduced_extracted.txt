6 (3) other aspects pertaining to the performance of abortions. (NRS 442.260)
7 Section 1 of this bill provides that existing law governing abortions, and any
8 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, supersede and preempt any local ordinance or
9 regulation adopted by any county, city, district, agency or other political
10 subdivision of this State that specifically regulates or disproportionately affects
11 abortions or facilities that perform abortions.
12 Section 3 of this bill defines “health care facility” to refer to any entity that
13 provides health care. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a health care facility from
14 making or disseminating to the public a deceptive statement concerning any service
15 that is offered or is not offered by the health care facility. Section 5 of this bill
16 authorizes the Attorney General to seek certain remedial and injunctive relief and
17 civil penalties by bringing an action against a health care facility that violates the
