AN ACT relating to education; requiring certain school districts that

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and
3 authorizes any other board of trustees of a school district to establish a program of
4 career and technical education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law additionally authorizes
5 the State Board of Education to administer career and technical education in this
6 State and establish certain policies governing career and technical education. (NRS
7 388.360) Under existing regulations, the board of trustees of a school district is
8 authorized to offer a program of career and technical education with a course of
9 study designed to allow a pupil to pursue an industry-recognized credential as a
10 certified nursing assistant. (NAC 389.800, 389.803) As part of such a course of
11 study, a pupil enrolled in the program is required to either: (1) take an end-of-
12 program assessment prescribed by the Department of Education to measure the
13 proficiency of the pupil in the course of study; or (2) obtain an industry-recognized
14 credential in the program area. (NAC 389.800, as amended by LCB File No.
15 R019-24)
16 Section 11.3 of this bill requires the boards of trustees of the Clark County
17 School District, Elko County School District, Lyon County School District and
18 White Pine County School District, in coordination with the State Board of
19 Nursing, to establish a pilot program for the 2026-2027 and 2027-2028 school years

20 to cover the costs for pupils enrolled in a program of career and technical education
21 to be a certified nursing assistant to register for an examination to obtain an
22 industry-recognized credential as a certified nursing assistant. Under the pilot
23 program, a pupil is eligible for the school district to cover the cost of registering for
24 such an examination, in an amount not to exceed $300, if the pupil: (1) completes
25 the final course of instruction in a course of study to be a certified nursing assistant;
26 (2) elects to participate in the pilot program by opting to take an examination to
27 obtain an industry-recognized credential as a certified nursing assistant instead of
28 an end-of-program assessment prescribed by the Department; (3) satisfies all
29 prerequisites to take the examination; and (4) registers for and completes the
30 examination. Section 11.3 requires each school district required to establish the
31 pilot program to coordinate with the State Board of Nursing to: (1) establish a
32 process to allocate and distribute funding to eligible pupils; (2) facilitate the
33 scheduling and administration of examinations at sites approved by the State Board
34 of Nursing; (3) inform pupils concerning eligibility for the pilot program; (4)
35 monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the pilot program to ensure
36 equitable access to opportunities for certification as a certified nursing assistant for
37 all pupils; and (5) track and compile certain information concerning the pilot
38 program. Section 11.7 appropriates money to the Department of Education for
39 distribution to the school districts required to establish the pilot program for the
40 purpose of covering the costs for eligible pupils to take the examination for an
41 industry-recognized credential as a certified nursing assistant.
