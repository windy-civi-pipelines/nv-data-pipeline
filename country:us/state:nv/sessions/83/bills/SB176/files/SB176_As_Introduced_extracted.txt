Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and
3 authorizes any other board of trustees of a school district to establish a program of
4 career and technical education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law additionally authorizes
5 the State Board of Education to administer career and technical education in this
6 State and establish certain policies governing career and technical education. (NRS
7 388.360) Section 1 of this bill requires that, to receive credit for completing a
8 program of career and technical education, a pupil enrolled in programs of career
9 and technical education to be a certified nursing assistant, emergency medical
10 technician or cosmetologist must complete any licensing examination and
11 application required to receive a professional license or certificate. Section 1
-
*SB176*
– 2 –
12 additionally requires: (1) the board of trustees of each school district to cover
13 registration costs for certain pupils to take such an examination if the examination
14 is administered by an entity other than a state professional licensing board; (2)
15 certain state professional licensing boards to waive each examination fee and
16 application fee charged by the board or offer a payment plan to certain pupils; (3)
17 certain professional licensing boards to waive the requirement that a person be at
18 least 18 years of age to receive a license or certificate if he or she completes the
19 requirements set forth in section 1; and (4) the Department of Education to
20 collaborate with the board of trustees of certain school districts and licensing
21 boards to carry out certain provisions of section 1. Section 2 of this bill includes
22 section 1 among the provisions governing how the money for career and technical
23 education is required to be provided for and raised. (NRS 388.400)
24 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 1 and 2 do not
25 apply to pupils enrolled in a program of career and technical education before the
26 2027-2028 school year.
27 Existing law provides that, to receive a license or certificate as a cosmetologist,
28 hair designer, advanced esthetician, esthetician, nail technologist, hair braider or
29 electrologist, as applicable, a person must be at least 18 years of age. (NRS
30 644A.300, 644A.315, 644A.328, 644A.330, 644A.345, 644A.360, 644A.400)
31 Sections 5-11 of this bill make a conforming change to eliminate this requirement
32 for pupils who complete the requirements set forth in section 1.
33 Existing law authorizes a student to receive a Governor Guinn Millennium
34 Scholarship if the student meets certain eligibility requirements, including, without
35 limitation, enrolling in a certain number of credit hours in eligible institutions.
36 (NRS 396.930) Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that, to be eligible
37 to receive a Millennium Scholarship, a student must be enrolled in at least 12
38 semester credit hours at certain institutions, thereby authorizing a part-time student
39 enrolled in such institutions to obtain a Millennium Scholarship. Section 3
40 additionally provides that, for a part-time student to be eligible to receive a
41 Millennium Scholarship, he or she must be enrolled in 24 semester credit hours in a
42 calendar year at an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education.
43 Because a Millennium Scholarship is awarded on a semester-basis, section 3
44 provides for the forfeiture of eligibility for a Millennium Scholarship if a part-time
45 student receives a Millennium Scholarship for a semester but does not enroll in 24
46 semester credit hours in the 12-month period beginning with that semester.
47 Existing law provides that a student who is eligible to receive a Millennium
48 Scholarship is prohibited from receiving more than the cost of 15 semester credits
49 per semester. Existing law additionally provides that a student may have his or her
50 scholarship revoked upon failure to meet certain academic requirements. (NRS
51 396.934) Section 4 of this bill requires the Board of Regents of the University of
52 Nevada to establish procedures: (1) for certain students who received a Millennium
53 Scholarship to, under certain conditions, request additional disbursements in their
54 final 2 years of enrollment; and (2) governing a process for a student to appeal the
55 revocation of his or her Millennium Scholarship. Section 4 additionally requires the
56 Board of Regents to: (1) prepare an annual report including certain information
57 relating to such appeals; and (2) submit the report to the Director of the Legislative
58 Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature.

____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 34-45)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring pupils enrolled in
programs of career and technical education for certain
professions to take licensure or certification examinations
and submit the corresponding applications for licensure or
certification to receive credit for completing the program;
revising provisions governing eligibility to receive a
Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship; requiring the
Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to adopt
certain procedures relating to the Millennium Scholarship;
revising provisions governing fee and age requirements
for licensure and certification for certain professions
included in programs of career and technical education;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and
3 authorizes any other board of trustees of a school district to establish a program of
4 career and technical education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law additionally authorizes
5 the State Board of Education to administer career and technical education in this
6 State and establish certain policies governing career and technical education. (NRS
7 388.360) Section 1 of this bill requires that, to receive credit for completing a
8 program of career and technical education, a pupil enrolled in programs of career
9 and technical education to be a certified nursing assistant, emergency medical
10 technician or cosmetologist must complete any licensing examination and
11 application required to receive a professional license or certificate. Section 1
-
*SB176*

– 2 –
12 additionally requires: (1) the board of trustees of each school district to cover
13 registration costs for certain pupils to take such an examination if the examination
14 is administered by an entity other than a state professional licensing board; (2)
15 certain state professional licensing boards to waive each examination fee and
16 application fee charged by the board or offer a payment plan to certain pupils; (3)
17 certain professional licensing boards to waive the requirement that a person be at
18 least 18 years of age to receive a license or certificate if he or she completes the
19 requirements set forth in section 1; and (4) the Department of Education to
20 collaborate with the board of trustees of certain school districts and licensing
21 boards to carry out certain provisions of section 1. Section 2 of this bill includes
22 section 1 among the provisions governing how the money for career and technical
23 education is required to be provided for and raised. (NRS 388.400)
24 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 1 and 2 do not
25 apply to pupils enrolled in a program of career and technical education before the
26 2027-2028 school year.
27 Existing law provides that, to receive a license or certificate as a cosmetologist,
28 hair designer, advanced esthetician, esthetician, nail technologist, hair braider or
29 electrologist, as applicable, a person must be at least 18 years of age. (NRS
30 644A.300, 644A.315, 644A.328, 644A.330, 644A.345, 644A.360, 644A.400)
31 Sections 5-11 of this bill make a conforming change to eliminate this requirement
32 for pupils who complete the requirements set forth in section 1.
33 Existing law authorizes a student to receive a Governor Guinn Millennium
34 Scholarship if the student meets certain eligibility requirements, including, without
35 limitation, enrolling in a certain number of credit hours in eligible institutions.
36 (NRS 396.930) Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that, to be eligible
37 to receive a Millennium Scholarship, a student must be enrolled in at least 12
38 semester credit hours at certain institutions, thereby authorizing a part-time student
39 enrolled in such institutions to obtain a Millennium Scholarship. Section 3
40 additionally provides that, for a part-time student to be eligible to receive a
41 Millennium Scholarship, he or she must be enrolled in 24 semester credit hours in a
42 calendar year at an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education.
43 Because a Millennium Scholarship is awarded on a semester-basis, section 3
44 provides for the forfeiture of eligibility for a Millennium Scholarship if a part-time
45 student receives a Millennium Scholarship for a semester but does not enroll in 24
46 semester credit hours in the 12-month period beginning with that semester.
47 Existing law provides that a student who is eligible to receive a Millennium
48 Scholarship is prohibited from receiving more than the cost of 15 semester credits
49 per semester. Existing law additionally provides that a student may have his or her
50 scholarship revoked upon failure to meet certain academic requirements. (NRS
51 396.934) Section 4 of this bill requires the Board of Regents of the University of
52 Nevada to establish procedures: (1) for certain students who received a Millennium
53 Scholarship to, under certain conditions, request additional disbursements in their
54 final 2 years of enrollment; and (2) governing a process for a student to appeal the
55 revocation of his or her Millennium Scholarship. Section 4 additionally requires the
56 Board of Regents to: (1) prepare an annual report including certain information
57 relating to such appeals; and (2) submit the report to the Director of the Legislative
58 Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature.
