AN ACT relating to education; requiring [pupils enrolled in programs of career and
technical education for certain professions to take licensure or
certification examinations and submit the corresponding applications
for licensure or certification to receive credit for completing the
program; revising provisions governing eligibility to receive a
Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship; requiring the Board of
Regents of the University of Nevada to adopt certain procedures
relating to the Millennium Scholarship; revising provisions governing
fee and age requirements for licensure and certification for certain
professions included in programs] certain school districts that offer a
program of career and technical education [;] for certified nursing
assistants to establish a pilot program to cover the costs of
examinations for certain pupils enrolled in the program to obtain
an industry-recognized credential as a certified nursing assistant;
making appropriations; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district in a county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and authorizes any
3 other board of trustees of a school district to establish a program of career and technical
4 education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law additionally authorizes the State Board of Education
5 to administer career and technical education in this State and establish certain policies
6 governing career and technical education. (NRS 388.360) [Section 1 of this bill requires that,
7 to receive credit for completing a program of career and technical education, a pupil enrolled
8 in programs of career and technical education to be a certified nursing assistant, emergency
9 medical technician or cosmetologist must complete any licensing examination and application
10 required to receive a professional license or certificate. Section 1 additionally requires: (1) the
11 board of trustees of each school district to cover registration costs for certain pupils to take
12 such an examination if the examination is administered by an entity other than a state
13 professional licensing board; (2) certain state professional licensing boards to waive each
Senate Amendment No. 26 to Senate Bill No. 176 Page 4
14 examination fee and application fee charged by the board or offer a payment plan to certain
15 pupils; (3) certain professional licensing boards to waive the requirement that a person be at
16 least 18 years of age to receive a license or certificate if he or she completes the requirements
17 set forth in section 1; and (4) the Department of Education to collaborate with the board of
18 trustees of certain school districts and licensing boards to carry out certain provisions of
19 section 1. Section 2 of this bill includes section 1 among the provisions governing how the
20 money for career and technical education is required to be provided for and raised. (NRS
21 388.400)
22 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 1 and 2 do not apply to
23 pupils enrolled in a program of career and technical education before the 2027-2028 school
24 year.
25 Existing law provides that, to receive a license or certificate as a cosmetologist, hair
26 designer, advanced esthetician, esthetician, nail technologist, hair braider or electrologist, as
27 applicable, a person must be at least 18 years of age. (NRS 644A.300, 644A.315, 644A.328,
28 644A.330, 644A.345, 644A.360, 644A.400) Sections 5-11 of this bill make a conforming
29 change to eliminate this requirement for pupils who complete the requirements set forth in
30 section 1.
31 Existing law authorizes a student to receive a Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship if
32 the student meets certain eligibility requirements, including, without limitation, enrolling in a
33 certain number of credit hours in eligible institutions. (NRS 396.930) Section 3 of this bill
34 eliminates the requirement that, to be eligible to receive a Millennium Scholarship, a student
35 must be enrolled in at least 12 semester credit hours at certain institutions, thereby authorizing
36 a part-time student enrolled in such institutions to obtain a Millennium Scholarship. Section 3
37 additionally provides that, for a part-time student to be eligible to receive a Millennium
38 Scholarship, he or she must be enrolled in 24 semester credit hours in a calendar year at an
39 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education. Because a Millennium Scholarship
40 is awarded on a semester-basis, section 3 provides for the forfeiture of eligibility for a
41 Millennium Scholarship if a part-time student receives a Millennium Scholarship for a
42 semester but does not enroll in 24 semester credit hours in the 12-month period beginning
43 with that semester.
44 Existing law provides that a student who is eligible to receive a Millennium Scholarship
45 is prohibited from receiving more than the cost of 15 semester credits per semester. Existing
46 law additionally provides that a student may have his or her scholarship revoked upon failure
47 to meet certain academic requirements. (NRS 396.934) Section 4 of this bill requires the
48 Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to establish procedures: (1) for certain students
49 who received a Millennium Scholarship to, under certain conditions, request additional
50 disbursements in their final 2 years of enrollment; and (2) governing a process for a student to
51 appeal the revocation of his or her Millennium Scholarship. Section 4 additionally requires the
52 Board of Regents to: (1) prepare an annual report including certain information relating to
53 such appeals; and (2) submit the report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
54 transmittal to the Legislature.] Under existing regulations, the board of trustees of a school
55 district is authorized to offer a program of career and technical education with a course
56 of study designed to allow a pupil to pursue an industry-recognized credential as a
57 certified nursing assistant. (NAC 389.800, 389.803) As part of such a course of study, a
58 pupil enrolled in the program is required to either: (1) take an end-of-program
59 assessment prescribed by the Department of Education to measure the proficiency of the
60 pupil in the course of study; or (2) obtain an industry-recognized credential in the
61 program area. (NAC 389.800, as amended by LCB File No. R019-24)
62 Section 11.3 of this bill requires the boards of trustees of the Clark County School
63 District, Elko County School District, Lyon County School District and White Pine
64 County School District, in coordination with the State Board of Nursing, to establish a
65 pilot program for the 2026-2027 and 2027-2028 school years to cover the costs for pupils
66 enrolled in a program of career and technical education to be a certified nursing
67 assistant to register for an examination to obtain an industry-recognized credential as a
68 certified nursing assistant. Under the pilot program, a pupil is eligible for the school
69 district to cover the cost of registering for such an examination, in an amount not to
70 exceed $300, if the pupil: (1) completes the final course of instruction in a course of study
71 to be a certified nursing assistant; (2) elects to participate in the pilot program by opting
72 to take an examination to obtain an industry-recognized credential as a certified nursing
Senate Amendment No. 26 to Senate Bill No. 176 Page 5
73 assistant instead of an end-of-program assessment prescribed by the Department; (3)
74 satisfies all prerequisites to take the examination; and (4) registers for and completes the
75 examination. Section 11.3 requires each school district required to establish the pilot
76 program to coordinate with the State Board of Nursing to: (1) establish a process to
77 allocate and distribute funding to eligible pupils; (2) facilitate the scheduling and
78 administration of examinations at sites approved by the State Board of Nursing; (3)
79 inform pupils concerning eligibility for the pilot program; (4) monitor the
80 implementation and effectiveness of the pilot program to ensure equitable access to
81 opportunities for certification as a certified nursing assistant for all pupils; and (5) track
82 and compile certain information concerning the pilot program. Section 11.7
83 appropriates money to the Department of Education for distribution to the school
84 districts required to establish the pilot program for the purpose of covering the costs for
85 eligible pupils to take the examination for an industry-recognized credential as a
86 certified nursing assistant.

4 education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law additionally authorizes the State Board of Education
5 to administer career and technical education in this State and establish certain policies
6 governing career and technical education. (NRS 388.360) [Section 1 of this bill requires that,
7 to receive credit for completing a program of career and technical education, a pupil enrolled
8 in programs of career and technical education to be a certified nursing assistant, emergency
9 medical technician or cosmetologist must complete any licensing examination and application
10 required to receive a professional license or certificate. Section 1 additionally requires: (1) the
11 board of trustees of each school district to cover registration costs for certain pupils to take
12 such an examination if the examination is administered by an entity other than a state
13 professional licensing board; (2) certain state professional licensing boards to waive each

Senate Amendment No. 26 to Senate Bill No. 176 Page 4
14 examination fee and application fee charged by the board or offer a payment plan to certain
15 pupils; (3) certain professional licensing boards to waive the requirement that a person be at
16 least 18 years of age to receive a license or certificate if he or she completes the requirements
17 set forth in section 1; and (4) the Department of Education to collaborate with the board of
18 trustees of certain school districts and licensing boards to carry out certain provisions of
19 section 1. Section 2 of this bill includes section 1 among the provisions governing how the
20 money for career and technical education is required to be provided for and raised. (NRS
21 388.400)
22 Section 12 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 1 and 2 do not apply to
23 pupils enrolled in a program of career and technical education before the 2027-2028 school
24 year.
25 Existing law provides that, to receive a license or certificate as a cosmetologist, hair
26 designer, advanced esthetician, esthetician, nail technologist, hair braider or electrologist, as
27 applicable, a person must be at least 18 years of age. (NRS 644A.300, 644A.315, 644A.328,
28 644A.330, 644A.345, 644A.360, 644A.400) Sections 5-11 of this bill make a conforming
29 change to eliminate this requirement for pupils who complete the requirements set forth in
30 section 1.
31 Existing law authorizes a student to receive a Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship if
32 the student meets certain eligibility requirements, including, without limitation, enrolling in a
33 certain number of credit hours in eligible institutions. (NRS 396.930) Section 3 of this bill
34 eliminates the requirement that, to be eligible to receive a Millennium Scholarship, a student
35 must be enrolled in at least 12 semester credit hours at certain institutions, thereby authorizing
36 a part-time student enrolled in such institutions to obtain a Millennium Scholarship. Section 3
37 additionally provides that, for a part-time student to be eligible to receive a Millennium
38 Scholarship, he or she must be enrolled in 24 semester credit hours in a calendar year at an
39 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education. Because a Millennium Scholarship
40 is awarded on a semester-basis, section 3 provides for the forfeiture of eligibility for a
41 Millennium Scholarship if a part-time student receives a Millennium Scholarship for a
42 semester but does not enroll in 24 semester credit hours in the 12-month period beginning
43 with that semester.
44 Existing law provides that a student who is eligible to receive a Millennium Scholarship
45 is prohibited from receiving more than the cost of 15 semester credits per semester. Existing
46 law additionally provides that a student may have his or her scholarship revoked upon failure
47 to meet certain academic requirements. (NRS 396.934) Section 4 of this bill requires the
48 Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to establish procedures: (1) for certain students
49 who received a Millennium Scholarship to, under certain conditions, request additional
50 disbursements in their final 2 years of enrollment; and (2) governing a process for a student to
51 appeal the revocation of his or her Millennium Scholarship. Section 4 additionally requires the
52 Board of Regents to: (1) prepare an annual report including certain information relating to
53 such appeals; and (2) submit the report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
54 transmittal to the Legislature.] Under existing regulations, the board of trustees of a school
55 district is authorized to offer a program of career and technical education with a course
56 of study designed to allow a pupil to pursue an industry-recognized credential as a
57 certified nursing assistant. (NAC 389.800, 389.803) As part of such a course of study, a
58 pupil enrolled in the program is required to either: (1) take an end-of-program
59 assessment prescribed by the Department of Education to measure the proficiency of the
60 pupil in the course of study; or (2) obtain an industry-recognized credential in the
61 program area. (NAC 389.800, as amended by LCB File No. R019-24)
62 Section 11.3 of this bill requires the boards of trustees of the Clark County School
63 District, Elko County School District, Lyon County School District and White Pine
64 County School District, in coordination with the State Board of Nursing, to establish a
65 pilot program for the 2026-2027 and 2027-2028 school years to cover the costs for pupils
66 enrolled in a program of career and technical education to be a certified nursing
67 assistant to register for an examination to obtain an industry-recognized credential as a
68 certified nursing assistant. Under the pilot program, a pupil is eligible for the school
69 district to cover the cost of registering for such an examination, in an amount not to
70 exceed $300, if the pupil: (1) completes the final course of instruction in a course of study
71 to be a certified nursing assistant; (2) elects to participate in the pilot program by opting
72 to take an examination to obtain an industry-recognized credential as a certified nursing

Senate Amendment No. 26 to Senate Bill No. 176 Page 5
73 assistant instead of an end-of-program assessment prescribed by the Department; (3)
74 satisfies all prerequisites to take the examination; and (4) registers for and completes the
75 examination. Section 11.3 requires each school district required to establish the pilot
76 program to coordinate with the State Board of Nursing to: (1) establish a process to
77 allocate and distribute funding to eligible pupils; (2) facilitate the scheduling and
78 administration of examinations at sites approved by the State Board of Nursing; (3)
79 inform pupils concerning eligibility for the pilot program; (4) monitor the
80 implementation and effectiveness of the pilot program to ensure equitable access to
81 opportunities for certification as a certified nursing assistant for all pupils; and (5) track
82 and compile certain information concerning the pilot program. Section 11.7
83 appropriates money to the Department of Education for distribution to the school
84 districts required to establish the pilot program for the purpose of covering the costs for
85 eligible pupils to take the examination for an industry-recognized credential as a
86 certified nursing assistant.
