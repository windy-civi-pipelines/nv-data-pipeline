AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding certain prohibitions relating
to pornography involving minors; revising provisions
relating to the crime of unlawful dissemination of an
intimate image; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from committing certain acts regarding
2 pornography involving minors. (NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, sections 1 and
3 2 of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography involving images of
4 minors that have been altered through the use of artificial intelligence.
5 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or
6 distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or
7 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B
8 felony. (NRS 200.725) Section 1 expands this prohibition to include any item or
9 material that contains or incorporates an image of a minor that has been altered
10 through the use of artificial intelligence to depict the minor engaging in or
11 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct.
12 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
13 her possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a person
14 under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in,
15 simulating or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of:
16 (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any
17 subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) Section 2 expands this prohibition to include
18 any film, photograph or other visual representation that contains or incorporates an
19 image of a minor that has been altered through the use of artificial intelligence to
20 depict the minor as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or
21 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct.
22 Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex
23 offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445,
24 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these
-

– 2 –
25 requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS
26 179D.097) Because sections 1 and 2 expand the applicability of offenses involving
27 pornography and a minor, sections 1 and 2 have the effect of requiring a person
28 convicted of a violation of section 1 or 2 to: (1) register as a sex offender under
29 certain circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to
30 sex offenders.
31 Existing law provides that a person commits the crime of unlawful
32 dissemination of an intimate image and is guilty of a category D felony when, with
33 the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person electronically
34 disseminates or sells an intimate image which depicts the other person and the other
35 person: (1) did not give prior consent to the electronic dissemination or sale; (2)
36 had a reasonable expectation that the intimate image would be kept private and
37 would not be made visible to the public; and (3) was at least 18 years of age when
38 the intimate image was created. Existing law also sets forth certain exceptions
39 regarding when an intimate image may be lawfully electronically disseminated.
40 (NRS 200.780) Section 3 of this bill revises the definition of “intimate image” for
41 the purposes of this crime to include a photorealistic image of another person that
42 has been altered through the use of artificial intelligence to depict the other person
43 engaging in, or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual
44 conduct.
