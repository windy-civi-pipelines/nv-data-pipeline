Assembly Bill No. 248–Assemblymember Marzola
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to physical therapy; enacting and entering into the
Physical Therapy Licensure Compact; authorizing the sharing
of certain information with the data system created pursuant
to the Compact; providing a person practicing as a physical
therapist or physical therapist assistant under the Compact
with the same legal status as a person practicing as a physical
therapist or physical therapist assistant under a license issued
by the Nevada Physical Therapy Board; revising certain
terminology relating to physical therapists; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physical therapists and
physical therapist assistants in this State by the Nevada Physical Therapy Board.
(Chapter 640 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill enacts the Physical Therapy Licensure
Compact, which allows a person who is licensed as a physical therapist or physical
therapist assistant in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a
physical therapist or physical therapist assistant in other states that are members of
the Compact. In order to practice as a physical therapist or physical therapist
assistant under the Compact, the Compact requires a physical therapist or physical
therapist assistant to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2) have no
encumbrances on his or her license; (3) meet certain other requirements for
eligibility; (4) have had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority to
practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) notify the Physical
Therapy Compact Commission that he or she is seeking to practice under the
Compact in another state; (6) pay any applicable fees; (7) meet any requirements in
the state in which he or she seeks to practice under the Compact; and (8) report any
adverse action taken against him or her by a non-member state within 30 days after
the date the adverse action is taken. The Compact authorizes a member state to take
adverse action against a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant practicing
in the member state under the Compact.
The Compact requires member states to create and establish a joint public
agency called the Physical Therapy Compact Commission. The Commission is
required to, among other things: (1) establish bylaws; (2) make rules that facilitate
and coordinate the implementation and administration of the Compact; (3) hold
meetings, which may be closed under certain conditions; and (4) resolve disputes
related to the Compact among states that are members of the Compact. The
Commission is additionally authorized to levy and collect an annual assessment
from each state that is a member of the Compact.
The Compact also requires the Commission to provide for the development,
maintenance and utilization of a data system to facilitate the sharing of information
among member states. Section 2 of this bill, in general, authorizes the Nevada
Physical Therapy Board to disclose information to the data system when required
by the Compact. Section 9 of this bill provides for the confidentiality of certain
information disclosed through the data system.
Section 4 of this bill deems practicing as a physical therapist or physical
therapist assistant under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a license
issued by the Nevada Physical Therapy Board, thereby providing such persons with
-

the same authority, duties and legal protections as a licensee. Section 2 of this bill
requires a physical therapist practicing under the Compact to display proof that he
or she is authorized to practice under the Compact in the same manner as a licensed
physical therapist is required to display his or her license. Sections 5-8 and 10-14
of this bill replace the term “registered physical therapist” with the term “licensed
physical therapist” to reflect current terminology used in existing law governing the
practice of physical therapy and this bill.

PHYSICAL THERAPY LICENSURE COMPACT
SECTION 1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Compact is to facilitate interstate practice
of physical therapy with the goal of improving public access to
physical therapy services. The practice of physical therapy occurs
in the state where the patient/client is located at the time of the

authority of states to protect public health and safety through the
current system of state licensure.
This Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:
1. Increase public access to physical therapy services by
providing for the mutual recognition of other member state
licenses;
2. Enhance the states’ ability to protect the public’s health
and safety;
3. Encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating
multi-state physical therapy practice;
4. Support spouses of relocating military members;
5. Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative, and
disciplinary information between member states; and
6. Allow a remote state to hold a provider of services with a
compact privilege in that state accountable to that state’s practice
standards.

Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without
prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that
the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in
this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order
to:
1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
welfare;
2. Prevent a loss of Commission or member state funds;
3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an
administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or
4. Protect public health and safety.
M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the
Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or
amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors
in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public
notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the
Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision
may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a
material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing,
and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of
the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take
effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the
revision may not take effect without the approval of the
Commission.

SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION,
AND ENFORCEMENT
A. Oversight
1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state
government in each member state shall enforce this Compact and
take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the
Compact’s purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact
and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as
statutory law.
2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and
the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member
state pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may
affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to
intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide
service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or
order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated
rules.
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
1. If the Commission determines that a member state has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission
shall:
a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and
other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed
means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by
the Commission; and
b. Provide remedial training and specific technical
assistance regarding the default.
2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the
defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an
affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,
privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be
terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or
liabilities incurred during the period of default.
3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 18 –
minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of
the member states.
4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
beyond the effective date of termination.
5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a
state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated
from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
Commission and the defaulting state.
6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the
Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all
costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
C. Dispute Resolution
1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall
attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
among member states and between member and non-member
states.
2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
appropriate.
D. Enforcement
1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.
2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal
action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices against a member state in default to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
remedies available under federal or state law.

of the withdrawing state’s physical therapy licensing board to
comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting
requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

invalidate or prevent any physical therapy licensure agreement or
other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a
non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this
Compact.

amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding

member states.

creditor be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than
by a lump-sum payment if the award equals or exceeds $50,000 in
future damages.
4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future
damages by periodic payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court
shall make a specific finding as to the dollar amount of periodic
payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for such future
damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not
adequately insured to post security adequate to assure full payment
of such damages awarded by the judgment. Upon termination of
periodic payments of future damages, the court shall order the return
of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment debtor.
5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by
periodic payments entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the

payments, the interval between payments, and the number of
payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of
the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss
of future earnings must not be reduced or payments terminated by
reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but must be paid to
persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death.
In such cases, the court that rendered the original judgment may,
upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
subsection.

continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as

debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
fees.
7. Following the occurrence or expiration of all obligations
specified in the periodic payment judgment, any obligation of the
judgment debtor to make further payments ceases and any security
given pursuant to subsection 4 reverts to the judgment debtor.
8. As used in this section:
