AN ACT relating to physical therapy; enacting and entering into the
Physical Therapy Licensure Compact; authorizing the
sharing of certain information with the data system
created pursuant to the Compact; providing a person
practicing as a physical therapist or physical therapist
assistant under the Compact with the same legal status as
a person practicing as a physical therapist or physical
therapist assistant under a license issued by the Nevada
Physical Therapy Board; revising certain terminology
relating to physical therapists; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physical therapists and
2 physical therapist assistants in this State by the Nevada Physical Therapy Board.
3 (Chapter 640 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill enacts the Physical Therapy Licensure
4 Compact, which allows a person who is licensed as a physical therapist or physical
5 therapist assistant in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a
6 physical therapist or physical therapist assistant in other states that are members of
7 the Compact. In order to practice as a physical therapist or physical therapist
8 assistant under the Compact, the Compact requires a physical therapist or physical
9 therapist assistant to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2) have no
10 encumbrances on his or her license; (3) meet certain other requirements for
11 eligibility; (4) have had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority to
12 practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) notify the Physical
13 Therapy Compact Commission that he or she is seeking to practice under the
14 Compact in another state; (6) pay any applicable fees; (7) meet any requirements in
15 the state in which he or she seeks to practice under the Compact; and (8) report any
16 adverse action taken against him or her by a non-member state within 30 days after
17 the date the adverse action is taken. The Compact authorizes a member state to take
-
*AB248*

– 2 –
18 adverse action against a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant practicing
19 in the member state under the Compact.
20 The Compact requires member states to create and establish a joint public
21 agency called the Physical Therapy Compact Commission. The Commission is
22 required to, among other things: (1) establish bylaws; (2) make rules that facilitate
23 and coordinate the implementation and administration of the Compact; (3) hold
24 meetings, which may be closed under certain conditions; and (4) resolve disputes
25 related to the Compact among states that are members of the Compact. The
26 Commission is additionally authorized to levy and collect an annual assessment
27 from each state that is a member of the Compact.
28 The Compact also requires the Commission to provide for the development,
29 maintenance and utilization of a data system to facilitate the sharing of information
30 among member states. Section 2 of this bill, in general, authorizes the Nevada
31 Physical Therapy Board to disclose information to the data system when required
32 by the Compact. Section 9 of this bill provides for the confidentiality of certain
33 information disclosed through the data system.
34 Section 4 of this bill deems practicing as a physical therapist or physical
35 therapist assistant under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a license
36 issued by the Nevada Physical Therapy Board, thereby providing such persons with
37 the same authority, duties and legal protections as a licensee. Section 2 of this bill
38 requires a physical therapist practicing under the Compact to display proof that he
39 or she is authorized to practice under the Compact in the same manner as a licensed
40 physical therapist is required to display his or her license. Sections 5-8 and 10-14
41 of this bill replace the term “registered physical therapist” with the term “licensed
42 physical therapist” to reflect current terminology used in existing law governing the
43 practice of physical therapy and this bill.

13 defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an
14 affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,
15 privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be
16 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
17 default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or
18 liabilities incurred during the period of default.
19 3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
20 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
21 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be

23 minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of
24 the member states.
25 4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
26 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the

32 Commission and the defaulting state.
33 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the
34 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
35 of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its

40 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise

44 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
45 appropriate.

5 action in the United States District Court for the District of
6 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
7 principal offices against a member state in default to enforce
8 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
9 promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
10 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
11 necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of
12 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
14 of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
15 remedies available under federal or state law.

19 THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES,

33 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day
34 the Compact becomes law in that state.

36 enacting a statute repealing the same.
37 1. A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until
38 six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.

44 invalidate or prevent any physical therapy licensure agreement or
45 other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a
-

30 42.021 1. In an action for injury or death against a provider
31 of health care based upon professional negligence, if the defendant

3 (a) Recover any amount against the plaintiff; or
4 (b) Be subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff against a
5 defendant.
6 3. In an action for injury or death against a provider of health
7 care based upon professional negligence, a district court shall, at the
8 request of either party, enter a judgment ordering that money
9 damages or its equivalent for future damages of the judgment
10 creditor be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than

13 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future
14 damages by periodic payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court

17 damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
18 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not
19 adequately insured to post security adequate to assure full payment
20 of such damages awarded by the judgment. Upon termination of
21 periodic payments of future damages, the court shall order the return

27 payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
28 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of
29 the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss
30 of future earnings must not be reduced or payments terminated by
31 reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but must be paid to
32 persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
33 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death.
34 In such cases, the court that rendered the original judgment may,
35 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
36 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
37 subsection.
38 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
39 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
40 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
41 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
42 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
43 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
44 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
45 fees.

7 treatment, care or custody, loss of future earnings, loss of bodily
8 function, or future pain and suffering of the judgment creditor.
