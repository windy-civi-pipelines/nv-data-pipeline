EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the process for appointing certain members
to the county fair and recreation board of certain counties; requiring the
members of the board to elect any member as Chair of the board; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a county fair and recreation board in any county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more and less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County). The
3 board must consist of nine members, including one member appointed by the board of county
4 commissioners, one member appointed by the governing body of the largest incorporated city
5 in the county (currently the City of Reno) and one member appointed by the governing body
6 of the next largest incorporated city in the county (currently the City of Sparks). Those three
7 members must appoint the remaining six members who represent certain interests and
8 establishments from certain lists of nominees. If those three members find the nominees on a
9 list of nominees unacceptable, the three members are required to request a new list of
10 nominees. (NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the members of the board, including
11 each member of the board, to : (1) appoint the six members who represent certain interests
12 and establishments; and (2) request a new list of nominees.
13 Existing law further requires the members of the board to elect a Chair from among the
14 three members appointed by the board of county commissioners and the governing bodies of
15 the two largest incorporated cities in the county, respectively. (NRS 244A.601) This bill
16 instead requires the members of the board to elect a Chair from among its members.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
