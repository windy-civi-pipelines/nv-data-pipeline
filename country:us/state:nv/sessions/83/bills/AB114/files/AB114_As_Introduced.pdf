EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the process for appointing
certain members to the county fair and recreation board of
certain counties; requiring the members of the board to
elect any member as Chair of the board; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a county fair and recreation board in any county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more and less than 700,000 (currently Washoe County).
3 The board must consist of nine members, including one member appointed by the
4 board of county commissioners, one member appointed by the governing body of
5 the largest incorporated city in the county (currently the City of Reno) and one
6 member appointed by the governing body of the next largest incorporated city in
7 the county (currently the City of Sparks). Those three members must appoint the
8 remaining six members who represent certain interests and establishments from
9 certain lists of nominees. If those three members find the nominees on a list of
10 nominees unacceptable, the three members are required to request a new list of
11 nominees. (NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the members of the board,
12 including each member of the board, to request a new list of nominees.
13 Existing law further requires the members of the board to elect a Chair from
14 among the three members appointed by the board of county commissioners and the
15 governing bodies of the two largest incorporated cities in the county, respectively.
16 (NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the members of the board to elect a
17 Chair from among its members.
