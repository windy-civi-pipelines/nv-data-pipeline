Assembly Bill No. 114–Assemblymember DeLong
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the process for appointing
certain members to the county fair and recreation board of
certain counties; requiring the members of the board to elect
any member as Chair of the board; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes a county fair and recreation board in any county whose
population is 100,000 or more and less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe
County). The board must consist of nine members, including one member
appointed by the board of county commissioners, one member appointed by the
governing body of the largest incorporated city in the county (currently the City of
Reno) and one member appointed by the governing body of the next largest
incorporated city in the county (currently the City of Sparks). Those three members
must appoint the remaining six members who represent certain interests and
establishments from certain lists of nominees. If those three members find the
nominees on a list of nominees unacceptable, the three members are required to
request a new list of nominees. (NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the
members of the board, including each member of the board, to: (1) appoint the six
members who represent certain interests and establishments; and (2) request a new
list of nominees.
Existing law further requires the members of the board to elect a Chair from
among the three members appointed by the board of county commissioners and the
governing bodies of the two largest incorporated cities in the county, respectively.
(NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the members of the board to elect a
Chair from among its members.
