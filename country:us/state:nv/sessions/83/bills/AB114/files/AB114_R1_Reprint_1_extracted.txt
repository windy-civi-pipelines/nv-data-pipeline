SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to county fair and

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the process for appointing
certain members to the county fair and recreation board of
certain counties; requiring the members of the board to
elect any member as Chair of the board; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a county fair and recreation board in any county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more and less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe
3 County). The board must consist of nine members, including one member
4 appointed by the board of county commissioners, one member appointed by the
5 governing body of the largest incorporated city in the county (currently the City of
6 Reno) and one member appointed by the governing body of the next largest
7 incorporated city in the county (currently the City of Sparks). Those three members
8 must appoint the remaining six members who represent certain interests and
9 establishments from certain lists of nominees. If those three members find the
10 nominees on a list of nominees unacceptable, the three members are required to
11 request a new list of nominees. (NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the
12 members of the board, including each member of the board, to: (1) appoint the six
13 members who represent certain interests and establishments; and (2) request a new
14 list of nominees.
15 Existing law further requires the members of the board to elect a Chair from
16 among the three members appointed by the board of county commissioners and the
17 governing bodies of the two largest incorporated cities in the county, respectively.
18 (NRS 244A.601) This bill instead requires the members of the board to elect a
19 Chair from among its members.
