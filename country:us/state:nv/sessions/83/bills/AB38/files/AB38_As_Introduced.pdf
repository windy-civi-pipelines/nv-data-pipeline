-
*AB38*

– 2 –
5 manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.122, 489.611-489.661) Sections 2 and 9 of this
6 bill make certain provisions in existing law relating to the issuance of certificates
7 and labels of compliance applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.241,
8 489.461) Sections 3 and 14-18 of this bill make the requirements in existing law
9 relating to regulations governing certain sales and the issuance of certificates of
10 title by the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
11 applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.272, 489.531-489.581) Sections 4-
12 6 of this bill make the enforcement authority of the Division in existing law relating
13 to notice of violations, orders to vacate and orders to stop work applicable to
14 manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.291, 489.295, 489.297) Section 8 of this bill
15 makes the provisions relating to advance fees in existing law applicable to sales of
16 manufactured buildings and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.426)
17 Existing law creates the Account for Housing Inspection and Compliance in the
18 State General Fund and requires that this Account be administered by the Division.
19 (NRS 319.169) Under existing law, a person is required to obtain a license from the
20 Division to engage in the business of a dealer, distributor, manufacturer, general
21 serviceperson, specialty serviceperson, salesperson or certain managing employee
22 in connection with the sale, lease, distribution, alteration, repair, remodeling or
23 manufacture of a manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or
24 commercial coach or factory-built housing. (NRS 489.311, 489.341) Existing law
25 provides a procedure pursuant to which certain persons who obtain judgments
26 against such licensees for acts of fraud, misrepresentation or deceit made in
27 connection with their licenses are authorized to make a claim for payment from the
28 Account of any unpaid damages, subject to certain monetary limitations. (NRS
29 489.4971-489.4989) Sections 10 and 11 of this bill clarify that an eligible claimant
30 for such a payment is not only a purchaser of a manufactured home, mobile home,
31 manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing but any person
32 who entered into an agreement for the sale, purchase, lease, distribution, alteration,
33 repair, remodeling or manufacture of such housing. Sections 10 and 11 also
34 expand the actions regarding which such claims are authorized to be made to
35 include any action against a licensee in which damages are recovered for an act or
36 omission of the licensee that violates the laws governing manufactured homes,
37 mobile homes, manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built
38 housing. Additionally, sections 10 and 11 reorganize the existing procedure for
39 making a claim for payment from the Account. Section 7 of this bill makes a
40 conforming change to refer to a provision that has been renumbered by section 10.
41 (NRS 489.325)
42 Existing law sets forth certain requirements concerning the sale of a new, used
43 or rebuilt manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial
44 coach or new, used or rebuilt factory-built housing. (NRS 489.501, 489.511,
45 489.521) If such a sale is conducted by a dealer, existing law requires the dealer to
46 complete a report of sale in a form prescribed by the Division and submit the report
47 of sale and certain other documents to the Division within certain time periods after
48 the sale. (NRS 489.501, 489.511) In addition to the report of sale and other
49 documents, sections 12 and 13 of this bill require a dealer to submit to the Division
50 within certain time periods after the sale the completed contract for sale prescribed
51 by the Administrator of the Division.
52 Sections 19-23 of this bill make the provisions in existing law relating to the
53 issuance of labels and certificates of installation applicable to manufactured
54 buildings and commercial coaches. (NRS 489.591-489.5965) Section 29 of this bill
55 makes the exemption of a dealer from property taxes for inventory in existing law
56 applicable to the dealer’s inventory of manufactured buildings and factory-built
57 housing. (NRS 489.711) Section 30 of this bill makes the requirements for offers to
58 sell, buy or lease used manufactured homes, mobile homes and commercial coaches
59 applicable to such offers for used manufactured buildings and factory-built housing.

60 (NRS 489.715) Section 31 of this bill expands the forms of contracts in existing
61 law that the Administrator is required to prescribe for use by a dealer to include
62 contracts for the sale or listing for sale of a manufactured building or factory-built
63 housing. (NRS 489.7152)
64 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Division to investigate and audit any financial
65 account related to the business of a dealer or distributor of a manufactured home,
66 mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing
67 to investigate potential insolvency or to administer or enforce any law; and (2)
68 requires the Administrator to adopt regulations prescribing the scope of such an
69 audit. (NRS 489.7235) Instead of investigating for potential insolvency, section 32
70 of this bill authorizes the Division to investigate whether the dealer or distributor
71 violated laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured
72 buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Section 32 also broadens
73 the authority of the Division for adoption of the regulations to include the
74 investigation and other related matters.
75 Sections 33 and 35 of this bill expand the prohibition in existing law against a
76 dealer commingling his or her money with money or other property of a seller or
77 purchaser of a manufactured home or mobile home to apply to sales or purchases of
78 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (NRS
79 489.727, 489.821) Section 34 of this bill expands the prohibition against
80 manufacturing a manufactured home, mobile home, travel trailer or commercial
81 coach unless the components and system are constructed or assembled according to
82 certain standards to include manufactured buildings and factory-built housing.
83 (NRS 489.801)
84 Existing law sets forth certain rights and obligations of the owner or lessor of a
85 manufactured home lot within a manufactured home park or the owner or lessor of
86 such a park. (NRS 118B.065-118B.185) Existing law defines such an owner or
87 lessor as a “landlord.” (NRS 118B.014) Existing law defines the owner of a
88 manufactured home which is located on a manufactured home lot in a
89 manufactured home park as a “tenant.” (NRS 118B.0185) Section 36 of this bill
90 establishes the rights of the landlord to access the lot of a tenant. Section 36 is
91 modeled on the rights of a landlord to access the dwelling unit of a tenant in the
92 Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. (NRS 118A.330)
93 Existing law prohibits certain retaliatory conduct by a landlord against a tenant,
94 including terminating a tenancy, refusing to renew a tenancy, increasing rent or
95 decreasing services, or bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession of a
96 manufactured home lot because the tenant has complained to the landlord
97 concerning a violation of certain provisions of existing law. (NRS 118B.210)
98 Section 39 of this bill also prohibits such retaliatory conduct by a landlord against a
99 tenant who complains about a violation of section 36.
100 Existing law requires a landlord to: (1) provide certain written disclosures to
101 each tenant, including certain contact information for the park owner, manager,
102 assistant manager and person authorized to receive service of process for the
103 landlord; and (2) post or provide to each tenant the office hours or the landlord’s
104 availability at the park. (NRS 118B.080) Section 37 of this bill adds to such
105 disclosure requirements an electronic mail address for such persons and requires
106 that the office hours be during regular business hours. Section 37 also requires that
107 the manager or assistant manager of a manufactured home park consisting of 75 or
108 more lots: (1) be available at the park location for a minimum of 8 hours each week
109 during regular business hours; and (2) post such hours.
110 Existing law authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee to require a
111 tenant to landscape and maintain the tenant’s lot if the landlord advises the tenant in
112 writing of reasonable requirements for landscaping. (NRS 118B.120) Section 38 of
113 this bill changes the authority of the landlord regarding landscaping to only allow
114 the landlord to require the tenant to reasonably maintain the tenant’s lot to control
-
*AB38*

– 4 –
115 weeds and any grass or other vegetation and only if the landlord had provided the
116 tenant with 30 days’ advance written notice of the requirement.
117 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions relating to a
118 mobile home park. (NRS 461A.215-461A.237) Section 40 of this bill requires a
119 seller or transferor of a mobile home park to notify the Division of the sale or
120 transfer of the park, in a form prescribed by the Division, within 10 business days
121 after the sale or transfer.
