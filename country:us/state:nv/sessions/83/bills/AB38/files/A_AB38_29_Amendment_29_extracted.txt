Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
2 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (Chapter 489 of NRS)
3 Sections [1] 1.3 and 24-28 of this bill make the requirements and prohibitions in existing law
4 relating to trip permits applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.122, 489.611-
5 489.661) [Sections] Section 2 [and 9] of this bill [make] makes certain provisions in existing
6 law relating to the issuance of certificates and labels of compliance applicable to
7 manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.241, 489.461) Sections 3 and 14-18 of this bill make the
8 requirements in existing law relating to regulations governing certain sales and the issuance of
9 certificates of title by the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
10 applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.272, 489.531-489.581) Sections 4-6 of this
Assembly Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 38 Page 4
11 bill make the enforcement authority of the Division in existing law relating to notice of
12 violations, orders to vacate and orders to stop work applicable to manufactured buildings.
13 (NRS 489.291, 489.295, 489.297) Section 8 of this bill makes the provisions relating to
14 advance fees in existing law applicable to sales of manufactured buildings and factory-built
15 housing. (NRS 489.426)
16 Existing law authorizes, in certain circumstances, and requires, upon receiving a
17 complaint, the Administrator of the Division to investigate certain actions of a licensee or
18 other person suspected to violate any provision of existing law regulating various
19 activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured buildings,
20 commercial coaches and factory-built housing and take certain disciplinary action. (NRS
21 489.431) Section 8.5 of this bill: (1) provides, with certain exceptions, that the documents,
22 files and communications made or received relating to such an investigation are
23 confidential and not a public record; and (2) requires the Administrator, to the extent
24 feasible, to communicate or cooperate with a licensing board or any other agency
25 conducting an investigation relating to such acts. Section 39.7 of this bill makes a
26 conforming change to indicate that such records are not public records.
27 Existing law creates the Account for Housing Inspection and Compliance in the State
28 General Fund and requires that this Account be administered by the Division. (NRS 319.169)
29 Under existing law, a person is required to obtain a license from the Division to engage in the
30 business of a dealer, distributor, manufacturer, general serviceperson, specialty serviceperson,
31 salesperson or certain managing employee in connection with the sale, lease, distribution,
32 alteration, repair, remodeling or manufacture of a manufactured home, mobile home,
33 manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing. (NRS 489.311, 489.341)
34 Existing law provides a procedure pursuant to which certain persons who obtain judgments
35 against such licensees for acts of fraud, misrepresentation or deceit made in connection with
36 their licenses are authorized to make a claim for payment from the Account of any unpaid
37 damages, subject to certain monetary limitations. (NRS 489.4971-489.4989) Sections 10 and
38 11 of this bill clarify that an eligible claimant for such a payment is not only a purchaser of a
39 manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-
40 built housing but any person who entered into an agreement for the sale, purchase, lease,
41 distribution, alteration, repair, remodeling or manufacture of such housing. Sections 10 and
42 11 also expand the actions regarding which such claims are authorized to be made to include
43 any action against a licensee in which damages are recovered for an act or omission of the
44 licensee that violates the laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured
45 buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Additionally, sections 10 and 11
46 reorganize the existing procedure for making a claim for payment from the Account. Section
47 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to a provision that has been renumbered by
48 section 10. (NRS 489.325)
49 Existing law sets forth certain requirements concerning the sale of a new, used or rebuilt
50 manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or new, used
51 or rebuilt factory-built housing. (NRS 489.501, 489.511, 489.521) If such a sale is conducted
52 by a dealer, existing law requires the dealer to complete a report of sale in a form prescribed
53 by the Division and submit the report of sale and certain other documents to the Division
54 within certain time periods after the sale. (NRS 489.501, 489.511) [In addition to the report of
55 sale and other documents, sections] Sections 12 and 13 of this bill require [a dealer to submit]
56 that the report of sale submitted to the Division [within certain time periods after the sale
57 the completed contract for sale prescribed by the Administrator of the Division.] be
58 completed.
59 Sections 19-23 of this bill make the provisions in existing law relating to the issuance of
60 labels and certificates of installation applicable to manufactured buildings and commercial
61 coaches. (NRS 489.591-489.5965) Section 29 of this bill makes the exemption of a dealer
62 from property taxes for inventory in existing law applicable to the dealer’s inventory of
63 manufactured buildings and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.711) Section 30 of this bill
64 makes the requirements for offers to sell, buy or lease used manufactured homes, mobile
65 homes and commercial coaches applicable to such offers for used manufactured buildings and
66 factory-built housing. (NRS 489.715) Section 31 of this bill expands the forms of contracts in
67 existing law that the Administrator is required to prescribe for use by a dealer to include
68 contracts for the sale or listing for sale of a manufactured building or factory-built housing.
69 (NRS 489.7152)
Assembly Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 38 Page 5
70 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Division to investigate and audit any financial account
71 related to the business of a dealer or distributor of a manufactured home, mobile home,
72 manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing to investigate potential
73 insolvency or to administer or enforce any law; and (2) requires the Administrator to adopt
74 regulations prescribing the scope of such an audit. (NRS 489.7235) Instead of investigating
75 for potential insolvency, section 32 of this bill authorizes the Division to investigate whether
76 the dealer or distributor violated laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes,
77 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Section 32 also
78 broadens the authority of the Division for adoption of the regulations to include the
79 investigation and other related matters.
80 Sections 33 and 35 of this bill expand the prohibition in existing law against a dealer
81 commingling his or her money with money or other property of a seller or purchaser of a
82 manufactured home or mobile home to apply to sales or purchases of manufactured buildings,
83 commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.727, 489.821) Section 34 of this bill
84 expands the prohibition against manufacturing a manufactured home, mobile home [, travel
85 trailer] or commercial coach unless the components and system are constructed or assembled
86 according to certain standards to include manufactured buildings and factory-built housing.
87 (NRS 489.801)
88 [Existing law sets forth certain rights and obligations of the owner or lessor of a
89 manufactured home lot within a manufactured home park or the owner or lessor of such a
90 park. (NRS 118B.065-118B.185) Existing law defines such an owner or lessor as a
91 “landlord.” (NRS 118B.014) Existing law defines the owner of a manufactured home which is
92 located on a manufactured home lot in a manufactured home park as a “tenant.” (NRS
93 118B.0185) Section 36 of this bill establishes the rights of the landlord to access the lot of a
94 tenant. Section 36 is modeled on the rights of a landlord to access the dwelling unit of a tenant
95 in the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. (NRS 118A.330)
96 Existing law prohibits certain retaliatory conduct by a landlord against a tenant, including
97 terminating a tenancy, refusing to renew a tenancy, increasing rent or decreasing services, or
98 bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession of a manufactured home lot because
99 the tenant has complained to the landlord concerning a violation of certain provisions of
100 existing law. (NRS 118B.210) Section 39 of this bill also prohibits such retaliatory conduct by
101 a landlord against a tenant who complains about a violation of section 36.]
102 Existing law requires a landlord of a manufactured home lot or manufactured home
103 park to: (1) provide certain written disclosures to each tenant, including certain contact
104 information for the manufactured home park owner, manager, assistant manager and person
105 authorized to receive service of process for the landlord; and (2) post or provide to each tenant
106 the office hours or the landlord’s availability at the park. (NRS 118B.080) Section 37 of this
107 bill revises such disclosure requirements to mandate certain contact information for the
108 representative of the manufactured home park instead of the manager or assistant
109 manager and adds to such disclosure requirements an electronic mail address , if available,
110 for [such persons and] the manufactured home park and the person authorized to receive
111 service of process for the landlord. Section 37 requires that the office hours be during
112 regular business hours. Section 37 also requires that the manager or assistant manager of a
113 manufactured home park consisting of 75 or more lots: (1) be available at the park location for
114 a minimum of 8 hours each week during regular business hours; and (2) post such hours.
115 Existing law authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee to require a tenant to
116 landscape and maintain the tenant’s lot if the landlord advises the tenant in writing of
117 reasonable requirements for landscaping. (NRS 118B.120) Section 38 of this bill changes the
118 authority of the landlord regarding landscaping to only allow the landlord , with certain
119 exceptions, to require the tenant to reasonably maintain the tenant’s lot to control weeds and
120 any grass or other vegetation and only if the landlord had provided the tenant with 30 days’
121 advance written notice of the requirement.
122 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions relating to a mobile home
123 park. (NRS 461A.215-461A.237) Section 40 of this bill requires a [seller or transferor]
124 purchaser or transferee of a mobile home park to notify the Division of the sale or transfer
125 of the park, in a form prescribed by the Division, within 10 business days after the sale or
126 transfer.
127 Section 40.5 of this bill repeals the definition of the term “travel trailer,” which has
128 the effect of eliminating the applicability to travel trailers of the provisions of law
Assembly Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 38 Page 6
129 regulating various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
130 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Sections 1-1.2,
131 1.4-2, 9, 28.5, 34-35 and 39.3 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
132 elimination of the term.

38 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
39 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
40 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
41 electronic medium would:
42 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
43 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
44 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
45 otherwise confidential.
46 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
47 custody or control of a public record:

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
2 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (Chapter 489 of NRS)
3 Sections [1] 1.3 and 24-28 of this bill make the requirements and prohibitions in existing law
4 relating to trip permits applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.122, 489.611-
5 489.661) [Sections] Section 2 [and 9] of this bill [make] makes certain provisions in existing
6 law relating to the issuance of certificates and labels of compliance applicable to
7 manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.241, 489.461) Sections 3 and 14-18 of this bill make the
8 requirements in existing law relating to regulations governing certain sales and the issuance of
9 certificates of title by the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
10 applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.272, 489.531-489.581) Sections 4-6 of this

Assembly Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 38 Page 4
11 bill make the enforcement authority of the Division in existing law relating to notice of
12 violations, orders to vacate and orders to stop work applicable to manufactured buildings.
13 (NRS 489.291, 489.295, 489.297) Section 8 of this bill makes the provisions relating to
14 advance fees in existing law applicable to sales of manufactured buildings and factory-built
15 housing. (NRS 489.426)
16 Existing law authorizes, in certain circumstances, and requires, upon receiving a
17 complaint, the Administrator of the Division to investigate certain actions of a licensee or
18 other person suspected to violate any provision of existing law regulating various
19 activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured buildings,
20 commercial coaches and factory-built housing and take certain disciplinary action. (NRS
21 489.431) Section 8.5 of this bill: (1) provides, with certain exceptions, that the documents,
22 files and communications made or received relating to such an investigation are
23 confidential and not a public record; and (2) requires the Administrator, to the extent
24 feasible, to communicate or cooperate with a licensing board or any other agency
25 conducting an investigation relating to such acts. Section 39.7 of this bill makes a
26 conforming change to indicate that such records are not public records.
27 Existing law creates the Account for Housing Inspection and Compliance in the State
28 General Fund and requires that this Account be administered by the Division. (NRS 319.169)
29 Under existing law, a person is required to obtain a license from the Division to engage in the
30 business of a dealer, distributor, manufacturer, general serviceperson, specialty serviceperson,
31 salesperson or certain managing employee in connection with the sale, lease, distribution,
32 alteration, repair, remodeling or manufacture of a manufactured home, mobile home,
33 manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing. (NRS 489.311, 489.341)
34 Existing law provides a procedure pursuant to which certain persons who obtain judgments
35 against such licensees for acts of fraud, misrepresentation or deceit made in connection with
36 their licenses are authorized to make a claim for payment from the Account of any unpaid
37 damages, subject to certain monetary limitations. (NRS 489.4971-489.4989) Sections 10 and
38 11 of this bill clarify that an eligible claimant for such a payment is not only a purchaser of a
39 manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-
40 built housing but any person who entered into an agreement for the sale, purchase, lease,
41 distribution, alteration, repair, remodeling or manufacture of such housing. Sections 10 and
42 11 also expand the actions regarding which such claims are authorized to be made to include
43 any action against a licensee in which damages are recovered for an act or omission of the
44 licensee that violates the laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured
45 buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Additionally, sections 10 and 11
46 reorganize the existing procedure for making a claim for payment from the Account. Section
47 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to a provision that has been renumbered by
48 section 10. (NRS 489.325)
49 Existing law sets forth certain requirements concerning the sale of a new, used or rebuilt
50 manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or new, used
51 or rebuilt factory-built housing. (NRS 489.501, 489.511, 489.521) If such a sale is conducted
52 by a dealer, existing law requires the dealer to complete a report of sale in a form prescribed
53 by the Division and submit the report of sale and certain other documents to the Division
54 within certain time periods after the sale. (NRS 489.501, 489.511) [In addition to the report of
55 sale and other documents, sections] Sections 12 and 13 of this bill require [a dealer to submit]
56 that the report of sale submitted to the Division [within certain time periods after the sale
57 the completed contract for sale prescribed by the Administrator of the Division.] be
58 completed.
59 Sections 19-23 of this bill make the provisions in existing law relating to the issuance of
60 labels and certificates of installation applicable to manufactured buildings and commercial
61 coaches. (NRS 489.591-489.5965) Section 29 of this bill makes the exemption of a dealer
62 from property taxes for inventory in existing law applicable to the dealer’s inventory of
63 manufactured buildings and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.711) Section 30 of this bill
64 makes the requirements for offers to sell, buy or lease used manufactured homes, mobile
65 homes and commercial coaches applicable to such offers for used manufactured buildings and
66 factory-built housing. (NRS 489.715) Section 31 of this bill expands the forms of contracts in
67 existing law that the Administrator is required to prescribe for use by a dealer to include
68 contracts for the sale or listing for sale of a manufactured building or factory-built housing.
69 (NRS 489.7152)

Assembly Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 38 Page 5
70 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Division to investigate and audit any financial account
71 related to the business of a dealer or distributor of a manufactured home, mobile home,
72 manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing to investigate potential
73 insolvency or to administer or enforce any law; and (2) requires the Administrator to adopt
74 regulations prescribing the scope of such an audit. (NRS 489.7235) Instead of investigating
75 for potential insolvency, section 32 of this bill authorizes the Division to investigate whether
76 the dealer or distributor violated laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes,
77 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Section 32 also
78 broadens the authority of the Division for adoption of the regulations to include the
79 investigation and other related matters.
80 Sections 33 and 35 of this bill expand the prohibition in existing law against a dealer
81 commingling his or her money with money or other property of a seller or purchaser of a
82 manufactured home or mobile home to apply to sales or purchases of manufactured buildings,
83 commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.727, 489.821) Section 34 of this bill
84 expands the prohibition against manufacturing a manufactured home, mobile home [, travel
85 trailer] or commercial coach unless the components and system are constructed or assembled
86 according to certain standards to include manufactured buildings and factory-built housing.
87 (NRS 489.801)
88 [Existing law sets forth certain rights and obligations of the owner or lessor of a
89 manufactured home lot within a manufactured home park or the owner or lessor of such a
90 park. (NRS 118B.065-118B.185) Existing law defines such an owner or lessor as a
91 “landlord.” (NRS 118B.014) Existing law defines the owner of a manufactured home which is
92 located on a manufactured home lot in a manufactured home park as a “tenant.” (NRS
93 118B.0185) Section 36 of this bill establishes the rights of the landlord to access the lot of a
94 tenant. Section 36 is modeled on the rights of a landlord to access the dwelling unit of a tenant
95 in the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. (NRS 118A.330)
96 Existing law prohibits certain retaliatory conduct by a landlord against a tenant, including
97 terminating a tenancy, refusing to renew a tenancy, increasing rent or decreasing services, or
98 bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession of a manufactured home lot because
99 the tenant has complained to the landlord concerning a violation of certain provisions of
100 existing law. (NRS 118B.210) Section 39 of this bill also prohibits such retaliatory conduct by
101 a landlord against a tenant who complains about a violation of section 36.]
102 Existing law requires a landlord of a manufactured home lot or manufactured home
103 park to: (1) provide certain written disclosures to each tenant, including certain contact
104 information for the manufactured home park owner, manager, assistant manager and person
105 authorized to receive service of process for the landlord; and (2) post or provide to each tenant
106 the office hours or the landlord’s availability at the park. (NRS 118B.080) Section 37 of this
107 bill revises such disclosure requirements to mandate certain contact information for the
108 representative of the manufactured home park instead of the manager or assistant
109 manager and adds to such disclosure requirements an electronic mail address , if available,
110 for [such persons and] the manufactured home park and the person authorized to receive
111 service of process for the landlord. Section 37 requires that the office hours be during
112 regular business hours. Section 37 also requires that the manager or assistant manager of a
113 manufactured home park consisting of 75 or more lots: (1) be available at the park location for
114 a minimum of 8 hours each week during regular business hours; and (2) post such hours.
115 Existing law authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee to require a tenant to
116 landscape and maintain the tenant’s lot if the landlord advises the tenant in writing of
117 reasonable requirements for landscaping. (NRS 118B.120) Section 38 of this bill changes the
118 authority of the landlord regarding landscaping to only allow the landlord , with certain
119 exceptions, to require the tenant to reasonably maintain the tenant’s lot to control weeds and
120 any grass or other vegetation and only if the landlord had provided the tenant with 30 days’
121 advance written notice of the requirement.
122 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions relating to a mobile home
123 park. (NRS 461A.215-461A.237) Section 40 of this bill requires a [seller or transferor]
124 purchaser or transferee of a mobile home park to notify the Division of the sale or transfer
125 of the park, in a form prescribed by the Division, within 10 business days after the sale or
126 transfer.
127 Section 40.5 of this bill repeals the definition of the term “travel trailer,” which has
128 the effect of eliminating the applicability to travel trailers of the provisions of law

Assembly Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 38 Page 6
129 regulating various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
130 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Sections 1-1.2,
131 1.4-2, 9, 28.5, 34-35 and 39.3 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
132 elimination of the term.

14 declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
15 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
16 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be
17 prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or

24 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
25 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
26 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
27 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
28 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
29 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
30 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
31 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
32 record that is not otherwise confidential.
33 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
34 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

36 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
37 (a) The public record:
38 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
39 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
40 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
41 electronic medium would:
42 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
43 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
44 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
45 otherwise confidential.
46 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
47 custody or control of a public record:
48 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
49 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
50 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
51 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
52 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
53 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
