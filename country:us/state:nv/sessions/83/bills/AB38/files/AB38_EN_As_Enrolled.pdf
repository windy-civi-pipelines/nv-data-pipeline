Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law regulates various activities relating to manufactured homes,
mobile homes, manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built
housing. (Chapter 489 of NRS) Sections 1.3 and 24-28 of this bill make the
requirements and prohibitions in existing law relating to trip permits applicable to
manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.122, 489.611-489.661) Section 2 of this bill
makes certain provisions in existing law relating to the issuance of certificates and
labels of compliance applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.241,
489.461) Sections 3 and 14-18 of this bill make the requirements in existing law
relating to regulations governing certain sales and the issuance of certificates of
title by the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.272, 489.531-489.581) Sections 4-

Existing law creates the Account for Housing Inspection and Compliance in the
State General Fund and requires that this Account be administered by the Division.
(NRS 319.169) Under existing law, a person is required to obtain a license from the
Division to engage in the business of a dealer, distributor, manufacturer, general
serviceperson, specialty serviceperson, salesperson or certain managing employee
in connection with the sale, lease, distribution, alteration, repair, remodeling or
manufacture of a manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or
commercial coach or factory-built housing. (NRS 489.311, 489.341) Existing law
provides a procedure pursuant to which certain persons who obtain judgments
against such licensees for acts of fraud, misrepresentation or deceit made in
connection with their licenses are authorized to make a claim for payment from the
Account of any unpaid damages, subject to certain monetary limitations. (NRS
489.4971-489.4989) Sections 10 and 11 of this bill clarify that an eligible claimant
for such a payment is not only a purchaser of a manufactured home, mobile home,
manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing but any person
who entered into an agreement for the sale, purchase, lease, distribution, alteration,
repair, remodeling or manufacture of such housing. Sections 10 and 11 also
expand the actions regarding which such claims are authorized to be made to
include any action against a licensee in which damages are recovered for an act or
omission of the licensee that violates the laws governing manufactured homes,
mobile homes, manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built
housing. Additionally, sections 10 and 11 reorganize the existing procedure for
making a claim for payment from the Account. Section 7 of this bill makes a
conforming change to refer to a provision that has been renumbered by section 10.
(NRS 489.325)
Existing law sets forth certain requirements concerning the sale of a new, used
or rebuilt manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial
coach or new, used or rebuilt factory-built housing. (NRS 489.501, 489.511,
489.521) If such a sale is conducted by a dealer, existing law requires the dealer to
complete a report of sale in a form prescribed by the Division and submit the report
of sale and certain other documents to the Division within certain time periods after
the sale. (NRS 489.501, 489.511) Sections 12 and 13 of this bill require that the
report of sale submitted to the Division be completed.
Sections 19-23 of this bill make the provisions in existing law relating to the
issuance of labels and certificates of installation applicable to manufactured
buildings and commercial coaches. (NRS 489.591-489.5965) Section 29 of this bill
makes the exemption of a dealer from property taxes for inventory in existing law
applicable to the dealer’s inventory of manufactured buildings and factory-built
housing. (NRS 489.711) Section 30 of this bill makes the requirements for offers to
sell, buy or lease used manufactured homes, mobile homes and commercial coaches
applicable to such offers for used manufactured buildings and factory-built housing.
(NRS 489.715) Section 31 of this bill expands the forms of contracts in existing
law that the Administrator is required to prescribe for use by a dealer to include
contracts for the sale or listing for sale of a manufactured building or factory-built
housing. (NRS 489.7152)
Existing law: (1) authorizes the Division to investigate and audit any financial
account related to the business of a dealer or distributor of a manufactured home,
mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing
to investigate potential insolvency or to administer or enforce any law; and (2)
requires the Administrator to adopt regulations prescribing the scope of such an
audit. (NRS 489.7235) Instead of investigating for potential insolvency, section 32
of this bill authorizes the Division to investigate whether the dealer or distributor
violated laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured

buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Section 32 also broadens
the authority of the Division for adoption of the regulations to include the
investigation and other related matters.
Sections 33 and 35 of this bill expand the prohibition in existing law against a
dealer commingling his or her money with money or other property of a seller or
purchaser of a manufactured home or mobile home to apply to sales or purchases of
manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (NRS
489.727, 489.821) Section 34 of this bill expands the prohibition against
manufacturing a manufactured home, mobile home or commercial coach unless the
components and system are constructed or assembled according to certain standards
to include manufactured buildings and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.801)
Existing law requires a landlord of a manufactured home lot or manufactured
home park to: (1) provide certain written disclosures to each tenant, including
certain contact information for the manufactured home park owner, manager,
assistant manager and person authorized to receive service of process for the
landlord; and (2) post or provide to each tenant the office hours or the landlord’s
availability at the park. (NRS 118B.080) Section 37 of this bill revises such
disclosure requirements to mandate certain contact information for the
representative of the manufactured home park instead of the manager or assistant
manager and adds to such disclosure requirements an electronic mail address, if
available, for the manufactured home park and the person authorized to receive
service of process for the landlord. Section 37 requires that the office hours be
during regular business hours. Section 37 also requires that the manager or assistant
manager of a manufactured home park consisting of 75 or more lots: (1) be
available at the park location for a minimum of 8 hours each week during regular
business hours; and (2) post such hours.
Existing law authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee to require a
tenant to landscape and maintain the tenant’s lot if the landlord advises the tenant in
writing of reasonable requirements for landscaping. (NRS 118B.120) Section 38 of
this bill changes the authority of the landlord regarding landscaping to only allow
the landlord, with certain exceptions, to require the tenant to reasonably maintain
the tenant’s lot to control weeds and any grass or other vegetation and only if the
landlord had provided the tenant with 30 days’ advance written notice of the
requirement.
Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions relating to a
mobile home park. (NRS 461A.215-461A.237) Section 40 of this bill requires a
purchaser or transferee of a mobile home park to notify the Division of the sale or
transfer of the park, in a form prescribed by the Division, within 10 business days
after the sale or transfer.
Section 40.5 of this bill repeals the definition of the term “travel trailer,” which
has the effect of eliminating the applicability to travel trailers of the provisions of
law regulating various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Sections 1-
1.2, 1.4-2, 9, 28.5, 34-35 and 39.3 of this bill make conforming changes as a result
of the elimination of the term.

abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other
way to the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general
public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the
federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium if:
(a) The public record:
(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:
(1) Give access to proprietary software; or
(2) Require the production of information that is confidential
and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
or herself.
