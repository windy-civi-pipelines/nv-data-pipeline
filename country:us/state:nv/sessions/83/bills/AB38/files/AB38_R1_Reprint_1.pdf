Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

4 requirements and prohibitions in existing law relating to trip permits applicable to
-
*AB38_R1*

– 2 –
5 manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.122, 489.611-489.661) Section 2 of this bill
6 makes certain provisions in existing law relating to the issuance of certificates and
7 labels of compliance applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.241,
8 489.461) Sections 3 and 14-18 of this bill make the requirements in existing law
9 relating to regulations governing certain sales and the issuance of certificates of
10 title by the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
11 applicable to manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.272, 489.531-489.581) Sections 4-
12 6 of this bill make the enforcement authority of the Division in existing law relating
13 to notice of violations, orders to vacate and orders to stop work applicable to
14 manufactured buildings. (NRS 489.291, 489.295, 489.297) Section 8 of this bill
15 makes the provisions relating to advance fees in existing law applicable to sales of
16 manufactured buildings and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.426)
17 Existing law authorizes, in certain circumstances, and requires, upon receiving
18 a complaint, the Administrator of the Division to investigate certain actions of a
19 licensee or other person suspected to violate any provision of existing law
20 regulating various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
21 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing and take
22 certain disciplinary action. (NRS 489.431) Section 8.5 of this bill: (1) provides,
23 with certain exceptions, that the documents, files and communications made or
24 received relating to such an investigation are confidential and not a public record;
25 and (2) requires the Administrator, to the extent feasible, to communicate or
26 cooperate with a licensing board or any other agency conducting an investigation
27 relating to such acts. Section 39.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
28 indicate that such records are not public records.
29 Existing law creates the Account for Housing Inspection and Compliance in the
30 State General Fund and requires that this Account be administered by the Division.
31 (NRS 319.169) Under existing law, a person is required to obtain a license from the
32 Division to engage in the business of a dealer, distributor, manufacturer, general
33 serviceperson, specialty serviceperson, salesperson or certain managing employee
34 in connection with the sale, lease, distribution, alteration, repair, remodeling or
35 manufacture of a manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or
36 commercial coach or factory-built housing. (NRS 489.311, 489.341) Existing law
37 provides a procedure pursuant to which certain persons who obtain judgments
38 against such licensees for acts of fraud, misrepresentation or deceit made in
39 connection with their licenses are authorized to make a claim for payment from the
40 Account of any unpaid damages, subject to certain monetary limitations. (NRS
41 489.4971-489.4989) Sections 10 and 11 of this bill clarify that an eligible claimant
42 for such a payment is not only a purchaser of a manufactured home, mobile home,
43 manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing but any person
44 who entered into an agreement for the sale, purchase, lease, distribution, alteration,
45 repair, remodeling or manufacture of such housing. Sections 10 and 11 also
46 expand the actions regarding which such claims are authorized to be made to
47 include any action against a licensee in which damages are recovered for an act or
48 omission of the licensee that violates the laws governing manufactured homes,
49 mobile homes, manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built
50 housing. Additionally, sections 10 and 11 reorganize the existing procedure for
51 making a claim for payment from the Account. Section 7 of this bill makes a
52 conforming change to refer to a provision that has been renumbered by section 10.
53 (NRS 489.325)
54 Existing law sets forth certain requirements concerning the sale of a new, used
55 or rebuilt manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured building or commercial
56 coach or new, used or rebuilt factory-built housing. (NRS 489.501, 489.511,
57 489.521) If such a sale is conducted by a dealer, existing law requires the dealer to
58 complete a report of sale in a form prescribed by the Division and submit the report
59 of sale and certain other documents to the Division within certain time periods after
-
*AB38_R1*

– 3 –
60 the sale. (NRS 489.501, 489.511) Sections 12 and 13 of this bill require that the
61 report of sale submitted to the Division be completed.
62 Sections 19-23 of this bill make the provisions in existing law relating to the
63 issuance of labels and certificates of installation applicable to manufactured
64 buildings and commercial coaches. (NRS 489.591-489.5965) Section 29 of this bill
65 makes the exemption of a dealer from property taxes for inventory in existing law
66 applicable to the dealer’s inventory of manufactured buildings and factory-built
67 housing. (NRS 489.711) Section 30 of this bill makes the requirements for offers to
68 sell, buy or lease used manufactured homes, mobile homes and commercial coaches
69 applicable to such offers for used manufactured buildings and factory-built housing.
70 (NRS 489.715) Section 31 of this bill expands the forms of contracts in existing
71 law that the Administrator is required to prescribe for use by a dealer to include
72 contracts for the sale or listing for sale of a manufactured building or factory-built
73 housing. (NRS 489.7152)
74 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Division to investigate and audit any financial
75 account related to the business of a dealer or distributor of a manufactured home,
76 mobile home, manufactured building or commercial coach or factory-built housing
77 to investigate potential insolvency or to administer or enforce any law; and (2)
78 requires the Administrator to adopt regulations prescribing the scope of such an
79 audit. (NRS 489.7235) Instead of investigating for potential insolvency, section 32
80 of this bill authorizes the Division to investigate whether the dealer or distributor
81 violated laws governing manufactured homes, mobile homes, manufactured
82 buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Section 32 also broadens
83 the authority of the Division for adoption of the regulations to include the
84 investigation and other related matters.
85 Sections 33 and 35 of this bill expand the prohibition in existing law against a
86 dealer commingling his or her money with money or other property of a seller or
87 purchaser of a manufactured home or mobile home to apply to sales or purchases of
88 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. (NRS
89 489.727, 489.821) Section 34 of this bill expands the prohibition against
90 manufacturing a manufactured home, mobile home or commercial coach unless the
91 components and system are constructed or assembled according to certain standards
92 to include manufactured buildings and factory-built housing. (NRS 489.801)
93 Existing law requires a landlord of a manufactured home lot or manufactured
94 home park to: (1) provide certain written disclosures to each tenant, including
95 certain contact information for the manufactured home park owner, manager,
96 assistant manager and person authorized to receive service of process for the
97 landlord; and (2) post or provide to each tenant the office hours or the landlord’s
98 availability at the park. (NRS 118B.080) Section 37 of this bill revises such
99 disclosure requirements to mandate certain contact information for the
100 representative of the manufactured home park instead of the manager or assistant
101 manager and adds to such disclosure requirements an electronic mail address, if
102 available, for the manufactured home park and the person authorized to receive
103 service of process for the landlord. Section 37 requires that the office hours be
104 during regular business hours. Section 37 also requires that the manager or assistant
105 manager of a manufactured home park consisting of 75 or more lots: (1) be
106 available at the park location for a minimum of 8 hours each week during regular
107 business hours; and (2) post such hours.
108 Existing law authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee to require a
109 tenant to landscape and maintain the tenant’s lot if the landlord advises the tenant in
110 writing of reasonable requirements for landscaping. (NRS 118B.120) Section 38 of
111 this bill changes the authority of the landlord regarding landscaping to only allow
112 the landlord, with certain exceptions, to require the tenant to reasonably maintain
113 the tenant’s lot to control weeds and any grass or other vegetation and only if the
-
*AB38_R1*

– 4 –
114 landlord had provided the tenant with 30 days’ advance written notice of the
115 requirement.
116 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions relating to a
117 mobile home park. (NRS 461A.215-461A.237) Section 40 of this bill requires a
118 purchaser or transferee of a mobile home park to notify the Division of the sale or
119 transfer of the park, in a form prescribed by the Division, within 10 business days
120 after the sale or transfer.
121 Section 40.5 of this bill repeals the definition of the term “travel trailer,” which
122 has the effect of eliminating the applicability to travel trailers of the provisions of
123 law regulating various activities relating to manufactured homes, mobile homes,
124 manufactured buildings, commercial coaches and factory-built housing. Sections 1-
125 1.2, 1.4-2, 9, 28.5, 34-35 and 39.3 of this bill make conforming changes as a result
126 of the elimination of the term.
