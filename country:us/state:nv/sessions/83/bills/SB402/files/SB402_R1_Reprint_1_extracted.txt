EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing under certain
circumstances the governing body of a county or city to
create a restoration improvement district for the purpose
of a project to restore certain buildings that are at least 50
years of age; authorizing under certain circumstances the
governing body of a county or city to pledge certain
property tax proceeds for the costs of such a project;
establishing certain requirements for contracts or
agreements for construction work performed on such a
project; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a building
2 restoration project is or is expected to be located to create a restoration
3 improvement district that includes the project, or a part of the project, within its
4 boundaries. Section 3 of this bill defines the criteria for a project to qualify as a
5 building restoration project. Under section 7 of this bill, the governing body of a
6 county or city is authorized to: (1) adopt an ordinance creating a restoration
7 improvement district, subject to certain restrictions concerning the areas that may
8 be included in the district; and (2) pledge a portion of certain taxes on real property
9 collected in the district during a fiscal year, except that such a pledge may not

10 include taxes on real property levied by or for the benefit of a public body if the
11 governing body of that public body elects, within a certain period, not to include
12 such taxes in the pledge. Section 8 of this bill provides that the amount of the
13 property taxes pledged is equal to the property tax revenue, excluding property tax
14 rate levied by a public body that has elected pursuant to section 7 not to include
15 such rates in the pledge and certain other property tax rates, collected in the district
16 in excess of the property tax revenue collected in the district before the creation of
17 the district. Sections 9 and 12 of this bill exclude a district created pursuant to
18 section 7 from certain limitations on the amount of revenue that a local government
19 is authorized to collect from property taxes. Section 10 of this bill provides that
20 such money would be pledged to the developer of the project for certain costs of the
21 project pursuant to an agreement entered into by the county or city in which the
22 project is located. Section 11 of this bill provides that work performed on a project
23 after the effective date of an ordinance creating a district, pursuant to a contract for
24 construction of the project, is subject to the prevailing wage requirements set forth
25 in existing law. Sections 3-6 of this bill define terms for the purposes of this bill,
26 and section 2 of this bill specifies the applicability of those definitions.

20 require a nonrestricted license, as defined in NRS 463.0177, for a
21 period of at least 20 years from the date of the ordinance or the
22 creation of the district, whichever date is later.
23 (c) The written deed restriction or restrictive covenant shall be
24 a covenant running with the land for the benefit of the

32 alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the deed
33 restriction or restrictive covenant shall require the affirmative vote
34 of the governing body of the municipality creating the district.
35 4. A restoration improvement district may not include any
36 property that is, at the time the boundaries of the restoration
37 improvement district are created, included within a redevelopment

5 that city.
6 (b) A county must be located entirely within the boundaries of
7 that county and, when the district is created, entirely outside of the

9 Sec. 8. 1. After the effective date of an ordinance adopted
10 pursuant to section 7 of this act, any taxes levied upon the taxable
11 real property in the district each year by or for the benefit of the
12 State, the municipality and any public body must be divided as
13 follows:
14 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the
15 rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of those
16 taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the
17 taxable real property in the district as shown upon the last
18 equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
19 the real property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to and
20 when collected must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing
21 agencies as taxes by or for the taxing agencies on all other real

28 money pledged pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of
29 section 7 of this act. Unless the total assessed valuation of the
30 taxable real property in the restoration improvement district
31 exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable real property in the
32 district as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to
33 in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the
34 taxable real property in the district must be paid into the funds of
35 the respective taxing agencies. When all payments required by any
36 agreement entered into pursuant to section 10 of this act have
37 been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the
38 taxable real property in the restoration improvement district must
39 be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on
40 all other real property are paid.
41 2. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the
42 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1
43 which is attributable to any tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
44 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make
45 annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any
-
*SB402_R1*
– 6 –
1 bonded indebtedness that was approved by a majority of the
2 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
3 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
4 paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
5 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to
6 the last taxation of the real property before the effective date of the
7 ordinance, if that additional rate was approved by a majority of the
8 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
9 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
10 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
11 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was
12 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of
13 the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to,
14 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that
15 taxing agency.
16 (d) For the support of the public schools within a county
17 school district pursuant to NRS 387.195, must be allocated to, and
18 when collected must be paid into, the State Education Fund.

20 adopted a resolution pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of
21 section 7 of this act electing not to pledge the taxes levied by the
22 taxing agency, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
23 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
24 3. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 include,
25 without limitation, a tax rate approved for bonds of a county
26 school district issued pursuant to NRS 350.020, including, without
27 limitation, amounts necessary for a reserve account in the debt
28 service fund.
29 4. As used in this section, the term “last equalized assessment
30 roll” means the assessment roll in existence on the 15th day of
31 March immediately preceding the effective date of the ordinance.
32 Sec. 9. The allowed revenue from taxes ad valorem
33 determined pursuant to NRS 354.59811 does not apply to a district
34 created pursuant to this chapter.
35 Sec. 10. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if
36 the governing body of a municipality adopts an ordinance
37 pursuant to section 7 of this act, the municipality may enter into
38 an agreement with the developer of the building restoration
39 project for the cost of improving, rehabilitating, repairing,
40 equipping, maintaining or operating, or any combination thereof,
41 the project, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
42 desirable by the governing body of the municipality, including the
43 payment of reasonable interest and other financing costs for the
44 project. Any such reimbursements may be secured by a pledge of,
45 and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of
-
*SB402_R1*
– 7 –
1 this act and received with respect to the district. If such an
2 agreement is entered into, the agreement must provide for an
3 annual payment to the developer of the money pledged pursuant to
4 section 7 of this act and received by the municipality not later than
5 15 days after the date for such an annual payment specified in the
6 agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to this section is
7 not subject to the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and
8 may, at the option of the governing body, be binding on the
9 municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it was made, only if
10 the agreement pertains solely to the project.
11 2. No agreement entered into pursuant to this section may be
12 secured by or payable from the general fund of the municipality,
13 the power of the municipality to levy ad valorem property taxes, or
14 any source other than any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of
15 this act and received by the municipality with respect to the
16 district, or any combination thereof. No agreement entered into
17 pursuant to this section may ever become a general obligation of
18 the municipality or a charge against its general credit or taxing
19 powers, nor may any such agreement become a debt of the
20 municipality for purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
21 3. Any agreement entered pursuant to this section
22 automatically terminates at the end of the fiscal year in which the
23 20th anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance creating the
24 district occurs.
25 Sec. 11. The provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,
26 inclusive, apply to any construction work related to a building
27 restoration project performed after the effective date of an
28 ordinance creating a district adopted pursuant to section 7 of this
29 act with respect to the project, under a contract awarded or an
30 agreement entered into with respect to the project, whether or not
31 the contract was awarded or the agreement was entered into on or
32 after the effective date of that ordinance. If, pursuant to this
33 subsection, the provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive,
34 are applicable, the governing body, the developer, any contractor
35 who is awarded such a contract or enters into such an agreement
36 to perform the construction work and any subcontractor who
37 performs any portion of the construction work related to such a
38 project shall comply with the provisions of NRS 338.013 to
39 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the governing body
40 had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
41 Sec. 12. NRS 354.59811 is hereby amended to read as
42 follows:
43 354.59811 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 244.377,
44 278C.260, 354.59813, 354.59815, 354.59818, 354.5982, 354.5987,
45 354.705, 354.723, 450.425, 450.760, 540A.265 and 543.600, and
-
*SB402_R1*
– 8 –
1 section 9 of this act, for each fiscal year beginning on or after
2 July 1, 1989, the maximum amount of money that a local
3 government, except a school district, a district to provide a
4 telephone number for emergencies or a redevelopment agency, may
5 receive from taxes ad valorem, other than those attributable to the
6 net proceeds of minerals or those levied for the payment of bonded
7 indebtedness and interest thereon incurred as general long-term debt
8 of the issuer, or for the payment of obligations issued to pay the cost
9 of a water project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of
10 obligations under a capital lease executed before April 30, 1981,
11 must be calculated as follows:
12 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal
13 year’s assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding
14 fiscal year’s assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of
15 property on the central assessment roll which was allocated to the
16 local government, but excluding any assessed valuation attributable
17 to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation attributable to a
18 redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
19 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private
20 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it
21 will produce 106 percent of the maximum revenue allowable from
22 taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year, except that the rate so
23 determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the previous
24 fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of
25 a tax pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
26 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation,
27 excluding the assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of
28 minerals and the assessed valuation of a fire protection district
29 attributable to real property which is transferred from private
30 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, but
31 including new real property, possessory interests and mobile homes,
32 for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from
33 taxes ad valorem for the local government.
34 2. As used in this section, “general long-term debt” does not
35 include debt created for medium-term obligations pursuant to NRS
36 350.087 to 350.095, inclusive.
37 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and
38 approval.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing under certain
circumstances the governing body of a county or city to

of a project to restore certain buildings that are at least 50
years of age; authorizing under certain circumstances the
governing body of a county or city to pledge certain
property tax proceeds for the costs of such a project;
establishing certain requirements for contracts or
agreements for construction work performed on such a
project; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a building
2 restoration project is or is expected to be located to create a restoration
3 improvement district that includes the project, or a part of the project, within its
4 boundaries. Section 3 of this bill defines the criteria for a project to qualify as a
5 building restoration project. Under section 7 of this bill, the governing body of a
6 county or city is authorized to: (1) adopt an ordinance creating a restoration
7 improvement district, subject to certain restrictions concerning the areas that may
8 be included in the district; and (2) pledge a portion of certain taxes on real property
9 collected in the district during a fiscal year, except that such a pledge may not

10 include taxes on real property levied by or for the benefit of a public body if the
11 governing body of that public body elects, within a certain period, not to include
12 such taxes in the pledge. Section 8 of this bill provides that the amount of the
13 property taxes pledged is equal to the property tax revenue, excluding property tax
14 rate levied by a public body that has elected pursuant to section 7 not to include
15 such rates in the pledge and certain other property tax rates, collected in the district

17 the district. Sections 9 and 12 of this bill exclude a district created pursuant to
18 section 7 from certain limitations on the amount of revenue that a local government
19 is authorized to collect from property taxes. Section 10 of this bill provides that
20 such money would be pledged to the developer of the project for certain costs of the
21 project pursuant to an agreement entered into by the county or city in which the
22 project is located. Section 11 of this bill provides that work performed on a project
23 after the effective date of an ordinance creating a district, pursuant to a contract for
24 construction of the project, is subject to the prevailing wage requirements set forth
25 in existing law. Sections 3-6 of this bill define terms for the purposes of this bill,
26 and section 2 of this bill specifies the applicability of those definitions.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

18 nonrestricted operation, as defined in NRS 463.0177, on all or any
19 portion of the building restoration project that requires or would
20 require a nonrestricted license, as defined in NRS 463.0177, for a
21 period of at least 20 years from the date of the ordinance or the
22 creation of the district, whichever date is later.
23 (c) The written deed restriction or restrictive covenant shall be
24 a covenant running with the land for the benefit of the
25 municipality and shall be binding on the successors and assigns of
26 the building restoration project and the municipality.

28 covenant shall alter, amend, revoke or terminate the deed
29 restriction or restrictive covenant for a period of at least 20
30 continuous years after the adoption of the ordinance or creation of
31 the district, whichever date is later. After that time period, any
32 alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the deed
33 restriction or restrictive covenant shall require the affirmative vote
34 of the governing body of the municipality creating the district.
35 4. A restoration improvement district may not include any
36 property that is, at the time the boundaries of the restoration
37 improvement district are created, included within a redevelopment

5 that city.
6 (b) A county must be located entirely within the boundaries of
7 that county and, when the district is created, entirely outside of the

9 Sec. 8. 1. After the effective date of an ordinance adopted
10 pursuant to section 7 of this act, any taxes levied upon the taxable
11 real property in the district each year by or for the benefit of the
12 State, the municipality and any public body must be divided as
13 follows:
14 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the
15 rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of those
16 taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the
17 taxable real property in the district as shown upon the last
18 equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
19 the real property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to and
20 when collected must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing
21 agencies as taxes by or for the taxing agencies on all other real
22 property are paid.
23 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of
24 the taxes levied on taxable real property each year in excess of the
25 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) must be allocated
26 to, and when collected must be paid into, the restoration
27 improvement district account pertaining to the project to pay
28 money pledged pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of
29 section 7 of this act. Unless the total assessed valuation of the
30 taxable real property in the restoration improvement district
31 exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable real property in the
32 district as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to
33 in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the
34 taxable real property in the district must be paid into the funds of
35 the respective taxing agencies. When all payments required by any
36 agreement entered into pursuant to section 10 of this act have
37 been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the
38 taxable real property in the restoration improvement district must
39 be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on
40 all other real property are paid.
41 2. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the
42 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1
43 which is attributable to any tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
44 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make
45 annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any
-

– 6 –
1 bonded indebtedness that was approved by a majority of the
2 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
3 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
4 paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
5 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to
6 the last taxation of the real property before the effective date of the
7 ordinance, if that additional rate was approved by a majority of the
8 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
9 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
10 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
11 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was
12 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of
13 the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to,
14 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that
15 taxing agency.
16 (d) For the support of the public schools within a county
17 school district pursuant to NRS 387.195, must be allocated to, and
18 when collected must be paid into, the State Education Fund.

20 adopted a resolution pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of
21 section 7 of this act electing not to pledge the taxes levied by the
22 taxing agency, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
23 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
24 3. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 include,
25 without limitation, a tax rate approved for bonds of a county
26 school district issued pursuant to NRS 350.020, including, without
27 limitation, amounts necessary for a reserve account in the debt
28 service fund.
29 4. As used in this section, the term “last equalized assessment
30 roll” means the assessment roll in existence on the 15th day of
31 March immediately preceding the effective date of the ordinance.
32 Sec. 9. The allowed revenue from taxes ad valorem
33 determined pursuant to NRS 354.59811 does not apply to a district
34 created pursuant to this chapter.
35 Sec. 10. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if
36 the governing body of a municipality adopts an ordinance
37 pursuant to section 7 of this act, the municipality may enter into
38 an agreement with the developer of the building restoration
39 project for the cost of improving, rehabilitating, repairing,
40 equipping, maintaining or operating, or any combination thereof,
41 the project, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
42 desirable by the governing body of the municipality, including the
43 payment of reasonable interest and other financing costs for the
44 project. Any such reimbursements may be secured by a pledge of,
45 and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of
-
*SB402_R1*

– 7 –
1 this act and received with respect to the district. If such an
2 agreement is entered into, the agreement must provide for an
3 annual payment to the developer of the money pledged pursuant to
4 section 7 of this act and received by the municipality not later than
5 15 days after the date for such an annual payment specified in the
6 agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to this section is
7 not subject to the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and
8 may, at the option of the governing body, be binding on the
9 municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it was made, only if
10 the agreement pertains solely to the project.
11 2. No agreement entered into pursuant to this section may be
12 secured by or payable from the general fund of the municipality,
13 the power of the municipality to levy ad valorem property taxes, or
14 any source other than any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of
15 this act and received by the municipality with respect to the
16 district, or any combination thereof. No agreement entered into
17 pursuant to this section may ever become a general obligation of
18 the municipality or a charge against its general credit or taxing
19 powers, nor may any such agreement become a debt of the
20 municipality for purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
21 3. Any agreement entered pursuant to this section
22 automatically terminates at the end of the fiscal year in which the
23 20th anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance creating the
24 district occurs.
25 Sec. 11. The provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,
26 inclusive, apply to any construction work related to a building
27 restoration project performed after the effective date of an
28 ordinance creating a district adopted pursuant to section 7 of this
29 act with respect to the project, under a contract awarded or an
30 agreement entered into with respect to the project, whether or not
31 the contract was awarded or the agreement was entered into on or
32 after the effective date of that ordinance. If, pursuant to this
33 subsection, the provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive,
34 are applicable, the governing body, the developer, any contractor
35 who is awarded such a contract or enters into such an agreement
36 to perform the construction work and any subcontractor who
37 performs any portion of the construction work related to such a
38 project shall comply with the provisions of NRS 338.013 to
39 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the governing body
40 had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
41 Sec. 12. NRS 354.59811 is hereby amended to read as
42 follows:
43 354.59811 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 244.377,
44 278C.260, 354.59813, 354.59815, 354.59818, 354.5982, 354.5987,
45 354.705, 354.723, 450.425, 450.760, 540A.265 and 543.600, and

1 section 9 of this act, for each fiscal year beginning on or after
2 July 1, 1989, the maximum amount of money that a local
3 government, except a school district, a district to provide a
4 telephone number for emergencies or a redevelopment agency, may
5 receive from taxes ad valorem, other than those attributable to the
6 net proceeds of minerals or those levied for the payment of bonded
7 indebtedness and interest thereon incurred as general long-term debt
8 of the issuer, or for the payment of obligations issued to pay the cost
9 of a water project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of
10 obligations under a capital lease executed before April 30, 1981,
11 must be calculated as follows:
12 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal
13 year’s assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding
14 fiscal year’s assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of
15 property on the central assessment roll which was allocated to the
16 local government, but excluding any assessed valuation attributable
17 to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation attributable to a
18 redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
19 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private
20 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it
21 will produce 106 percent of the maximum revenue allowable from
22 taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year, except that the rate so
23 determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the previous
24 fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of
25 a tax pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
26 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation,
27 excluding the assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of
28 minerals and the assessed valuation of a fire protection district
29 attributable to real property which is transferred from private
30 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, but
31 including new real property, possessory interests and mobile homes,
32 for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from
33 taxes ad valorem for the local government.
34 2. As used in this section, “general long-term debt” does not
35 include debt created for medium-term obligations pursuant to NRS
36 350.087 to 350.095, inclusive.
37 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and
38 approval.
