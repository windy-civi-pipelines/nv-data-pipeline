Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a building
2 restoration project is or is expected to be located to create a restoration
3 improvement district that includes the project, or a part of the project, within its
4 boundaries. Section 3 of this bill defines the criteria for a project to qualify as a
5 building restoration project. Under section 7 of this bill, the governing body of a
6 county or city which creates a restoration improvement district is authorized to
7 pledge a portion of the property taxes collected in the district during a fiscal year.
8 Section 8 of this bill provides that the amount of the property taxes pledged is equal
9 to the property tax revenue, excluding certain property tax rates, collected in the
10 district in excess of the property tax revenue collected in the district before the
11 creation of the district. Sections 9 and 12 of this bill exclude a district created
12 pursuant to section 7 from certain limitations on the amount of revenue that a local
13 government is authorized to collect from property taxes. Section 10 of this bill

– 2 –
14 provides that such money would be pledged to the developer of the project for
15 certain costs of the project pursuant to an agreement entered into by the county or
16 city in which the project is located. Section 11 of this bill provides that work
17 performed on a project after the effective date of an ordinance creating a district,
18 pursuant to a contract for construction of the project, is subject to the prevailing
19 wage requirements set forth in existing law. Sections 3-6 of this bill define terms
20 for the purposes of this bill, and section 2 of this bill specifies the applicability of
21 those definitions.

1 ordinance adopted pursuant to this paragraph must include the
2 findings of the governing body of the municipality that the project
3 qualifies as a building restoration project.
4 (b) For the purposes of carrying out paragraph (a), include in
5 an ordinance adopted pursuant to that paragraph the pledge of the
6 proceeds of any taxes levied for a fiscal year upon taxable real
7 property in the district each year by or for the benefit of the State,
8 the municipality and any public body, in the amount determined
9 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of section 8 of this act.

11 (a) A city must be located entirely within the boundaries of
12 that city.
13 (b) A county must be located entirely within the boundaries of
14 that county and, when the district is created, entirely outside of the

17 pursuant to section 7 of this act, any taxes levied upon the taxable
18 real property in the district each year by or for the benefit of the
19 State, the municipality and any public body must be divided as
20 follows:
21 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the
22 rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for each of those
23 taxing agencies upon the total sum of the assessed value of the
24 taxable real property in the district as shown upon the last
25 equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
26 the real property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to and
27 when collected must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing
28 agencies as taxes by or for the taxing agencies on all other real
29 property are paid.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of
31 the taxes levied on taxable real property each year in excess of the
32 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) must be allocated
33 to, and when collected must be paid into, the restoration
34 improvement district account pertaining to the project to pay
35 money pledged pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of
36 section 7 of this act. Unless the total assessed valuation of the
37 taxable real property in the restoration improvement district
38 exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable real property in the
39 district as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to
40 in this subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the
41 taxable real property in the district must be paid into the funds of
42 the respective taxing agencies. When all payments required by any
43 agreement entered into pursuant to section 10 of this act have
44 been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the
45 taxable real property in the restoration improvement district must
-

1 be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on
2 all other real property are paid.
3 2. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the
4 amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1
5 which is attributable to any tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
6 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make
7 annual repayments of the principal of, and the interest on, any
8 bonded indebtedness that was approved by a majority of the
9 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
10 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
11 paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
12 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to
13 the last taxation of the real property before the effective date of the
14 ordinance, if that additional rate was approved by a majority of the
15 registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
16 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be
17 paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
18 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was
19 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of
20 the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to,
21 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that
22 taxing agency.
23 (d) For the support of the public schools within a county
24 school district pursuant to NRS 387.195, must be allocated to, and
25 when collected must be paid into, the State Education Fund.
26 3. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 include,
27 without limitation, a tax rate approved for bonds of a county
28 school district issued pursuant to NRS 350.020, including, without
29 limitation, amounts necessary for a reserve account in the debt
30 service fund.
31 4. As used in this section, the term “last equalized assessment
32 roll” means the assessment roll in existence on the 15th day of
33 March immediately preceding the effective date of the ordinance.
34 Sec. 9. The allowed revenue from taxes ad valorem
35 determined pursuant to NRS 354.59811 does not apply to a district
36 created pursuant to this chapter.
37 Sec. 10. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if
38 the governing body of a municipality adopts an ordinance
39 pursuant to section 7 of this act, the municipality may enter into
40 an agreement with the developer of the building restoration
41 project for the cost of improving, rehabilitating, repairing,
42 equipping, maintaining or operating, or any combination thereof,
43 the project, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
44 desirable by the governing body of the municipality, including the
45 payment of reasonable interest and other financing costs for the
-
*SB402*

– 5 –
1 project. Any such reimbursements may be secured by a pledge of,
2 and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of
3 this act and received with respect to the district. If such an
4 agreement is entered into, the agreement must provide for an
5 annual payment to the developer of the money pledged pursuant to
6 section 7 of this act and received by the municipality not later than
7 15 days after the date for such an annual payment specified in the
8 agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to this section is
9 not subject to the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and
10 may, at the option of the governing body, be binding on the
11 municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it was made, only if
12 the agreement pertains solely to the project.
13 2. No agreement entered into pursuant to this section may be
14 secured by or payable from the general fund of the municipality,
15 the power of the municipality to levy ad valorem property taxes, or
16 any source other than any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of
17 this act and received by the municipality with respect to the
18 district, or any combination thereof. No agreement entered into
19 pursuant to this section may ever become a general obligation of
20 the municipality or a charge against its general credit or taxing
21 powers, nor may any such agreement become a debt of the
22 municipality for purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
23 3. Any agreement entered pursuant to this section
24 automatically terminates at the end of the fiscal year in which the
25 20th anniversary of the adoption of the ordinance creating the
26 district occurs.
27 Sec. 11. The provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,
28 inclusive, apply to any construction work related to a building
29 restoration project performed after the effective date of an
30 ordinance creating a district adopted pursuant to section 7 of this
31 act with respect to the project, under a contract awarded or an
32 agreement entered into with respect to the project, whether or not
33 the contract was awarded or the agreement was entered into on or
34 after the effective date of that ordinance. If, pursuant to this
35 subsection, the provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive,
36 are applicable, the governing body, the developer, any contractor
37 who is awarded such a contract or enters into such an agreement
38 to perform the construction work and any subcontractor who
39 performs any portion of the construction work related to such a
40 project shall comply with the provisions of NRS 338.013 to
41 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the governing body
42 had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.

1 Sec. 12. NRS 354.59811 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 354.59811 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 244.377,
4 278C.260, 354.59813, 354.59815, 354.59818, 354.5982, 354.5987,
5 354.705, 354.723, 450.425, 450.760, 540A.265 and 543.600, and
6 section 9 of this act, for each fiscal year beginning on or after
7 July 1, 1989, the maximum amount of money that a local
8 government, except a school district, a district to provide a
9 telephone number for emergencies or a redevelopment agency, may
10 receive from taxes ad valorem, other than those attributable to the
11 net proceeds of minerals or those levied for the payment of bonded
12 indebtedness and interest thereon incurred as general long-term debt
13 of the issuer, or for the payment of obligations issued to pay the cost
14 of a water project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of
15 obligations under a capital lease executed before April 30, 1981,
16 must be calculated as follows:
17 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal
18 year’s assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding
19 fiscal year’s assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of
20 property on the central assessment roll which was allocated to the
21 local government, but excluding any assessed valuation attributable
22 to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation attributable to a
23 redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
24 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private
25 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it
26 will produce 106 percent of the maximum revenue allowable from
27 taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year, except that the rate so
28 determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the previous
29 fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of
30 a tax pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
31 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation,
32 excluding the assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of
33 minerals and the assessed valuation of a fire protection district
34 attributable to real property which is transferred from private
35 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, but
36 including new real property, possessory interests and mobile homes,
37 for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from
38 taxes ad valorem for the local government.
39 2. As used in this section, “general long-term debt” does not
40 include debt created for medium-term obligations pursuant to NRS
41 350.087 to 350.095, inclusive.
42 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and
43 approval.
