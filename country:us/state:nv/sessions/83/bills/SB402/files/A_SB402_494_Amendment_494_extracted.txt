EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing under certain circumstances the
governing body of a county or city to create a restoration improvement
district for the purpose of a project to restore certain buildings that are
at least 50 years of age; authorizing under certain circumstances the
governing body of a county or city to pledge certain property tax
proceeds for the costs of such a project; establishing certain
requirements for contracts or agreements for construction work
performed on such a project; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a building restoration
2 project is or is expected to be located to create a restoration improvement district that includes
3 the project, or a part of the project, within its boundaries. Section 3 of this bill defines the
4 criteria for a project to qualify as a building restoration project. Under section 7 of this bill,
5 the governing body of a county or city [which creates] is authorized to: (1) adopt an
6 ordinance creating a restoration improvement district [is authorized to] , subject to certain
7 restrictions concerning the areas that may be included in the district; and (2) pledge a
8 portion of [the property] certain taxes on real property collected in the district during a
9 fiscal year [.] , except that such a pledge may not include taxes on real property levied by
10 or for the benefit of a public body if the governing body of that public body elects, within
11 a certain period, not to include such taxes in the pledge. Section 8 of this bill provides that
12 the amount of the property taxes pledged is equal to the property tax revenue, excluding
13 property tax rate levied by a public body that has elected pursuant to section 7 not to
14 include such rates in the pledge and certain other property tax rates, collected in the district
15 in excess of the property tax revenue collected in the district before the creation of the district.
16 Sections 9 and 12 of this bill exclude a district created pursuant to section 7 from certain
17 limitations on the amount of revenue that a local government is authorized to collect from
Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 4
18 property taxes. Section 10 of this bill provides that such money would be pledged to the
19 developer of the project for certain costs of the project pursuant to an agreement entered into
20 by the county or city in which the project is located. Section 11 of this bill provides that work
21 performed on a project after the effective date of an ordinance creating a district, pursuant to a
22 contract for construction of the project, is subject to the prevailing wage requirements set forth
23 in existing law. Sections 3-6 of this bill define terms for the purposes of this bill, and section
24 2 of this bill specifies the applicability of those definitions.

38 would require a nonrestricted license, as defined in NRS 463.0177, for a period of
39 at least 20 years from the date of the ordinance or the creation of the district,
40 whichever date is later.
41 (c) The written deed restriction or restrictive covenant shall be a covenant
42 running with the land for the benefit of the municipality and shall be binding on
43 the successors and assigns of the building restoration project and the
44 municipality.

49 alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the deed restriction or
50 restrictive covenant shall require the affirmative vote of the governing body of the
51 municipality creating the district.
52 4. A restoration improvement district may not include any property that is,
53 at the time the boundaries of the restoration improvement district are created,
Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 6
1 included within a redevelopment area previously established pursuant to the laws
2 of this State.
3 5. A restoration improvement district may not include any parcel or parcels
4 of land, building or group of buildings or spaces that include or will include an
5 establishment, as defined in NRS 463.0148, that holds a nonrestricted gaming

8 Nevada Gaming Commission to operate gaming devices, as defined in NRS
9 463.0155, or games as defined NRS 463.0152, on a continuous or periodic basis.
10 6. A district created pursuant to this section by:
11 (a) A city must be located entirely within the boundaries of that city.
12 (b) A county must be located entirely within the boundaries of that county
13 and, when the district is created, entirely outside of the boundaries of any city.
14 Sec. 8. 1. After the effective date of an ordinance adopted pursuant to
15 section 7 of this act, any taxes levied upon the taxable real property in the district
16 each year by or for the benefit of the State, the municipality and any public body
17 must be divided as follows:
18 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the rate upon which
19 the tax is levied each year by or for each of those taxing agencies upon the total
20 sum of the assessed value of the taxable real property in the district as shown
21 upon the last equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
22 the real property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to and when collected
23 must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes by or for the
24 taxing agencies on all other real property are paid.
25 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of the taxes
26 levied on taxable real property each year in excess of the amount determined
27 pursuant to paragraph (a) must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid
28 into, the restoration improvement district account pertaining to the project to pay
29 money pledged pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of section 7 of this act.
30 Unless the total assessed valuation of the taxable real property in the restoration
31 improvement district exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable real property
32 in the district as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to in this
33 subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable real property in
34 the district must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When all
35 payments required by any agreement entered into pursuant to section 10 of this
36 act have been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable
37 real property in the restoration improvement district must be paid into the funds
38 of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other real property are paid.
39 2. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the amount
40 determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 which is attributable to any
41 tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
42 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make annual repayments
43 of the principal of, and the interest on, any bonded indebtedness that was
44 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of the taxing
45 agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must
46 be paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
47 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to the last
48 taxation of the real property before the effective date of the ordinance, if that
49 additional rate was approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area
50 of the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to, and when
51 collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
52 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was approved by a
53 majority of the registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon
Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 7
1 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid into, the
2 appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
3 (d) For the support of the public schools within a county school district
4 pursuant to NRS 387.195, must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid
5 into, the State Education Fund.
6 (e) For which the governing body of the taxing agency has adopted a
7 resolution pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of section 7 of this act
8 electing not to pledge the taxes levied by the taxing agency, must be allocated to,
9 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
10 3. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 include, without
11 limitation, a tax rate approved for bonds of a county school district issued
12 pursuant to NRS 350.020, including, without limitation, amounts necessary for a
13 reserve account in the debt service fund.
14 4. As used in this section, the term “last equalized assessment roll” means
15 the assessment roll in existence on the 15th day of March immediately preceding
16 the effective date of the ordinance.
17 Sec. 9. The allowed revenue from taxes ad valorem determined pursuant to
18 NRS 354.59811 does not apply to a district created pursuant to this chapter.
19 Sec. 10. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the governing
20 body of a municipality adopts an ordinance pursuant to section 7 of this act, the
21 municipality may enter into an agreement with the developer of the building
22 restoration project for the cost of improving, rehabilitating, repairing, equipping,
23 maintaining or operating, or any combination thereof, the project, which may
24 contain such terms as are determined to be desirable by the governing body of the
25 municipality, including the payment of reasonable interest and other financing
26 costs for the project. Any such reimbursements may be secured by a pledge of,
27 and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of this act and
28 received with respect to the district. If such an agreement is entered into, the
29 agreement must provide for an annual payment to the developer of the money
30 pledged pursuant to section 7 of this act and received by the municipality not later
31 than 15 days after the date for such an annual payment specified in the
32 agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to this section is not subject to
33 the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and may, at the option of the
34 governing body, be binding on the municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it
35 was made, only if the agreement pertains solely to the project.
36 2. No agreement entered into pursuant to this section may be secured by or
37 payable from the general fund of the municipality, the power of the municipality
38 to levy ad valorem property taxes, or any source other than any money pledged
39 pursuant to section 7 of this act and received by the municipality with respect to
40 the district, or any combination thereof. No agreement entered into pursuant to
41 this section may ever become a general obligation of the municipality or a charge
42 against its general credit or taxing powers, nor may any such agreement become
43 a debt of the municipality for purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
44 3. Any agreement entered pursuant to this section automatically terminates
45 at the end of the fiscal year in which the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the
46 ordinance creating the district occurs.
47 Sec. 11. The provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, apply to any
48 construction work related to a building restoration project performed after the
49 effective date of an ordinance creating a district adopted pursuant to section 7 of
50 this act with respect to the project, under a contract awarded or an agreement
51 entered into with respect to the project, whether or not the contract was awarded
52 or the agreement was entered into on or after the effective date of that ordinance.
53 If, pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,
Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 8
1 inclusive, are applicable, the governing body, the developer, any contractor who
2 is awarded such a contract or enters into such an agreement to perform the
3 construction work and any subcontractor who performs any portion of the
4 construction work related to such a project shall comply with the provisions of
5 NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the governing body
6 had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
7 Sec. 12. NRS 354.59811 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 354.59811 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 244.377, 278C.260,
9 354.59813, 354.59815, 354.59818, 354.5982, 354.5987, 354.705, 354.723,
10 450.425, 450.760, 540A.265 and 543.600, and section 9 of this act, for each fiscal
11 year beginning on or after July 1, 1989, the maximum amount of money that a local
12 government, except a school district, a district to provide a telephone number for
13 emergencies or a redevelopment agency, may receive from taxes ad valorem, other
14 than those attributable to the net proceeds of minerals or those levied for the
15 payment of bonded indebtedness and interest thereon incurred as general long-term
16 debt of the issuer, or for the payment of obligations issued to pay the cost of a water
17 project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of obligations under a capital
18 lease executed before April 30, 1981, must be calculated as follows:
19 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal year’s
20 assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding fiscal year’s
21 assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of property on the central
22 assessment roll which was allocated to the local government, but excluding any
23 assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation
24 attributable to a redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
25 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private ownership to
26 public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it will produce 106 percent of the
27 maximum revenue allowable from taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year,
28 except that the rate so determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the
29 previous fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of a tax
30 pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
31 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation, excluding the
32 assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of minerals and the assessed
33 valuation of a fire protection district attributable to real property which is
34 transferred from private ownership to public ownership for the purpose of
35 conservation, but including new real property, possessory interests and mobile
36 homes, for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from taxes ad
37 valorem for the local government.
38 2. As used in this section, “general long-term debt” does not include debt
39 created for medium-term obligations pursuant to NRS 350.087 to 350.095,
40 inclusive.
41 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing under certain circumstances the
governing body of a county or city to create a restoration improvement
district for the purpose of a project to restore certain buildings that are
at least 50 years of age; authorizing under certain circumstances the
governing body of a county or city to pledge certain property tax
proceeds for the costs of such a project; establishing certain
requirements for contracts or agreements for construction work
performed on such a project; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a building restoration
2 project is or is expected to be located to create a restoration improvement district that includes
3 the project, or a part of the project, within its boundaries. Section 3 of this bill defines the
4 criteria for a project to qualify as a building restoration project. Under section 7 of this bill,
5 the governing body of a county or city [which creates] is authorized to: (1) adopt an
6 ordinance creating a restoration improvement district [is authorized to] , subject to certain
7 restrictions concerning the areas that may be included in the district; and (2) pledge a
8 portion of [the property] certain taxes on real property collected in the district during a
9 fiscal year [.] , except that such a pledge may not include taxes on real property levied by
10 or for the benefit of a public body if the governing body of that public body elects, within
11 a certain period, not to include such taxes in the pledge. Section 8 of this bill provides that
12 the amount of the property taxes pledged is equal to the property tax revenue, excluding
13 property tax rate levied by a public body that has elected pursuant to section 7 not to
14 include such rates in the pledge and certain other property tax rates, collected in the district
15 in excess of the property tax revenue collected in the district before the creation of the district.
16 Sections 9 and 12 of this bill exclude a district created pursuant to section 7 from certain
17 limitations on the amount of revenue that a local government is authorized to collect from

Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 4
18 property taxes. Section 10 of this bill provides that such money would be pledged to the
19 developer of the project for certain costs of the project pursuant to an agreement entered into
20 by the county or city in which the project is located. Section 11 of this bill provides that work
21 performed on a project after the effective date of an ordinance creating a district, pursuant to a
22 contract for construction of the project, is subject to the prevailing wage requirements set forth
23 in existing law. Sections 3-6 of this bill define terms for the purposes of this bill, and section
24 2 of this bill specifies the applicability of those definitions.

3 municipality shall provide notice of the introduction of the ordinance to the
4 governing body of each public body, other than the State, by or for the benefit of

20 taxable real property in the district each year by or for the benefit of that public
21 body.

25 deed restriction or restrictive covenant with the developer of the project, and such
26 deed restriction or restrictive covenant has been properly and validly recorded
27 with the appropriate county recorder in the county where the building restoration
28 project is located. The recorded deed restriction or restrictive covenant must
29 restrict the use of the building restoration project or any portion of the building
30 restoration project as follows:

35 building restoration project or any portion of the building restoration project
36 from conducting or operating a nonrestricted operation, as defined in NRS
37 463.0177, on all or any portion of the building restoration project that requires or
38 would require a nonrestricted license, as defined in NRS 463.0177, for a period of
39 at least 20 years from the date of the ordinance or the creation of the district,
40 whichever date is later.
41 (c) The written deed restriction or restrictive covenant shall be a covenant
42 running with the land for the benefit of the municipality and shall be binding on
43 the successors and assigns of the building restoration project and the
44 municipality.
45 (d) No party to the written deed restriction or restrictive covenant shall alter,
46 amend, revoke or terminate the deed restriction or restrictive covenant for a
47 period of at least 20 continuous years after the adoption of the ordinance or
48 creation of the district, whichever date is later. After that time period, any
49 alteration, amendment, revocation or termination of the deed restriction or
50 restrictive covenant shall require the affirmative vote of the governing body of the
51 municipality creating the district.
52 4. A restoration improvement district may not include any property that is,
53 at the time the boundaries of the restoration improvement district are created,

Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 6
1 included within a redevelopment area previously established pursuant to the laws
2 of this State.
3 5. A restoration improvement district may not include any parcel or parcels
4 of land, building or group of buildings or spaces that include or will include an
5 establishment, as defined in NRS 463.0148, that holds a nonrestricted gaming
6 license, as defined in NRS 463.0177, whether the license is held by the owner,

8 Nevada Gaming Commission to operate gaming devices, as defined in NRS
9 463.0155, or games as defined NRS 463.0152, on a continuous or periodic basis.
10 6. A district created pursuant to this section by:
11 (a) A city must be located entirely within the boundaries of that city.
12 (b) A county must be located entirely within the boundaries of that county
13 and, when the district is created, entirely outside of the boundaries of any city.
14 Sec. 8. 1. After the effective date of an ordinance adopted pursuant to
15 section 7 of this act, any taxes levied upon the taxable real property in the district
16 each year by or for the benefit of the State, the municipality and any public body
17 must be divided as follows:
18 (a) That portion of the taxes that would be produced by the rate upon which
19 the tax is levied each year by or for each of those taxing agencies upon the total
20 sum of the assessed value of the taxable real property in the district as shown
21 upon the last equalized assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of
22 the real property by the taxing agency, must be allocated to and when collected
23 must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies as taxes by or for the
24 taxing agencies on all other real property are paid.
25 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion of the taxes
26 levied on taxable real property each year in excess of the amount determined
27 pursuant to paragraph (a) must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid
28 into, the restoration improvement district account pertaining to the project to pay
29 money pledged pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of section 7 of this act.
30 Unless the total assessed valuation of the taxable real property in the restoration
31 improvement district exceeds the total assessed value of the taxable real property
32 in the district as shown by the last equalized assessment roll referred to in this
33 subsection, all of the taxes levied and collected upon the taxable real property in
34 the district must be paid into the funds of the respective taxing agencies. When all
35 payments required by any agreement entered into pursuant to section 10 of this
36 act have been paid, all money thereafter received from taxes upon the taxable
37 real property in the restoration improvement district must be paid into the funds
38 of the respective taxing agencies as taxes on all other real property are paid.
39 2. The portion of the taxes levied each year in excess of the amount
40 determined pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 which is attributable to any
41 tax rate levied by a taxing agency:
42 (a) To produce revenue in an amount sufficient to make annual repayments
43 of the principal of, and the interest on, any bonded indebtedness that was
44 approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area of the taxing
45 agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must
46 be paid into, the debt service fund of that taxing agency.
47 (b) In excess of any tax rate of that taxing agency applicable to the last
48 taxation of the real property before the effective date of the ordinance, if that
49 additional rate was approved by a majority of the registered voters within the area
50 of the taxing agency voting upon the question, must be allocated to, and when
51 collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
52 (c) Pursuant to NRS 387.3285 or 387.3287, if that rate was approved by a
53 majority of the registered voters within the area of the taxing agency voting upon

Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 7
1 the question, must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid into, the
2 appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
3 (d) For the support of the public schools within a county school district
4 pursuant to NRS 387.195, must be allocated to, and when collected must be paid
5 into, the State Education Fund.
6 (e) For which the governing body of the taxing agency has adopted a
7 resolution pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of section 7 of this act
8 electing not to pledge the taxes levied by the taxing agency, must be allocated to,
9 and when collected must be paid into, the appropriate fund of that taxing agency.
10 3. The provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 include, without
11 limitation, a tax rate approved for bonds of a county school district issued
12 pursuant to NRS 350.020, including, without limitation, amounts necessary for a
13 reserve account in the debt service fund.
14 4. As used in this section, the term “last equalized assessment roll” means
15 the assessment roll in existence on the 15th day of March immediately preceding
16 the effective date of the ordinance.
17 Sec. 9. The allowed revenue from taxes ad valorem determined pursuant to
18 NRS 354.59811 does not apply to a district created pursuant to this chapter.
19 Sec. 10. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the governing
20 body of a municipality adopts an ordinance pursuant to section 7 of this act, the
21 municipality may enter into an agreement with the developer of the building
22 restoration project for the cost of improving, rehabilitating, repairing, equipping,
23 maintaining or operating, or any combination thereof, the project, which may
24 contain such terms as are determined to be desirable by the governing body of the
25 municipality, including the payment of reasonable interest and other financing
26 costs for the project. Any such reimbursements may be secured by a pledge of,
27 and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 7 of this act and
28 received with respect to the district. If such an agreement is entered into, the
29 agreement must provide for an annual payment to the developer of the money
30 pledged pursuant to section 7 of this act and received by the municipality not later
31 than 15 days after the date for such an annual payment specified in the
32 agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to this section is not subject to
33 the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and may, at the option of the
34 governing body, be binding on the municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it
35 was made, only if the agreement pertains solely to the project.
36 2. No agreement entered into pursuant to this section may be secured by or
37 payable from the general fund of the municipality, the power of the municipality
38 to levy ad valorem property taxes, or any source other than any money pledged
39 pursuant to section 7 of this act and received by the municipality with respect to
40 the district, or any combination thereof. No agreement entered into pursuant to
41 this section may ever become a general obligation of the municipality or a charge
42 against its general credit or taxing powers, nor may any such agreement become
43 a debt of the municipality for purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
44 3. Any agreement entered pursuant to this section automatically terminates
45 at the end of the fiscal year in which the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the
46 ordinance creating the district occurs.
47 Sec. 11. The provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, apply to any
48 construction work related to a building restoration project performed after the
49 effective date of an ordinance creating a district adopted pursuant to section 7 of
50 this act with respect to the project, under a contract awarded or an agreement
51 entered into with respect to the project, whether or not the contract was awarded
52 or the agreement was entered into on or after the effective date of that ordinance.
53 If, pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,

Senate Amendment No. 494 to Senate Bill No. 402 Page 8
1 inclusive, are applicable, the governing body, the developer, any contractor who
2 is awarded such a contract or enters into such an agreement to perform the
3 construction work and any subcontractor who performs any portion of the
4 construction work related to such a project shall comply with the provisions of
5 NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the governing body
6 had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
7 Sec. 12. NRS 354.59811 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 354.59811 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 244.377, 278C.260,
9 354.59813, 354.59815, 354.59818, 354.5982, 354.5987, 354.705, 354.723,
10 450.425, 450.760, 540A.265 and 543.600, and section 9 of this act, for each fiscal
11 year beginning on or after July 1, 1989, the maximum amount of money that a local
12 government, except a school district, a district to provide a telephone number for
13 emergencies or a redevelopment agency, may receive from taxes ad valorem, other
14 than those attributable to the net proceeds of minerals or those levied for the
15 payment of bonded indebtedness and interest thereon incurred as general long-term
16 debt of the issuer, or for the payment of obligations issued to pay the cost of a water
17 project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of obligations under a capital
18 lease executed before April 30, 1981, must be calculated as follows:
19 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal year’s
20 assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding fiscal year’s
21 assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of property on the central
22 assessment roll which was allocated to the local government, but excluding any
23 assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation
24 attributable to a redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
25 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private ownership to
26 public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it will produce 106 percent of the
27 maximum revenue allowable from taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year,
28 except that the rate so determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the
29 previous fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of a tax
30 pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
31 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation, excluding the
32 assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of minerals and the assessed
33 valuation of a fire protection district attributable to real property which is
34 transferred from private ownership to public ownership for the purpose of
35 conservation, but including new real property, possessory interests and mobile
36 homes, for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from taxes ad
37 valorem for the local government.
38 2. As used in this section, “general long-term debt” does not include debt
39 created for medium-term obligations pursuant to NRS 350.087 to 350.095,
40 inclusive.
41 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
