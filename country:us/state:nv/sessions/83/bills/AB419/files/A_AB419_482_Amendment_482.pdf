Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The State Engineer, an appointee of the Director of the State Department of
2 Conservation and Natural Resources, manages the appropriation of water in this State.
3 (Title 48 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill requires the State Engineer to prepare and submit
4 a biennial report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the

Assembly Amendment No. 482 to Assembly Bill No. 419 Page 4
5 Legislative Commission relating to certain applications to appropriate water that have
6 been pending a final decision by the State Engineer for 2 or more years.
7 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to make such reasonable rules and
8 regulations as may be necessary for the proper and orderly execution of the powers conferred
9 upon him or her by law, including regulations governing the practice and procedure in all
10 contests before the Office of the State Engineer. (NRS 532.120) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill
11 requires the State Engineer to adopt regulations: (1) governing hearings before the Office [;] ,
12 which must include rules governing expert testimony; and (2) to establish a pre-application
13 [review] process for purposes of the provisions governing underground water and wells, the
14 adjudication of vested water rights and the appropriation of public water, which must include
15 procedures [to submit an application for review for potential issues prior to the filing of the
16 application and] for a prospective applicant to meet with the State Engineer or his or her
17 designee at the request of [a] the potential applicant [.] to review the prospective application
18 and identify any potential barriers to approval of the application. (Chapters 533 and 534
19 of NRS)
20 [Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate water for beneficial use in
21 Nevada, or change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
22 appropriated, is required to first apply for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325) Existing law
23 requires the State Engineer to publish notice of such an application in certain newspapers of
24 general publication and on the Internet website of the Division of Water Resources of the
25 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. (NRS 533.360) Any interested
26 person may file a written protest against the granting of such an application with the State
27 Engineer and the State Engineer may hold a hearing regarding such a protest. (NRS 533.365)
28 The State Engineer is generally required to approve or reject the application within 2 years,
29 unless authorized to postpone taking action for certain reasons specified by law. (NRS
30 533.370) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, the State Engineer to
31 issue a preliminary determination on an application and any protest to the application within
32 150 days after the last publication of the notice of the application, and to provide notice of the
33 preliminary determination to the applicant and each protestant, if any; (2) provides for an
34 applicant or any protestant to file an objection to the preliminary determination within 30 days
35 after issuance; (3) requires the State Engineer to give an applicant and any protestants notice
36 of a filed objection within 15 days after filing; (4) requires, with certain exceptions, the State
37 Engineer to hold a hearing regarding an objection within 120 days after receipt of the
38 objection and to provide notice of the hearing; and (5) authorizes the State Engineer to
39 postpone issuing a preliminary determination under certain conditions.
40 Section 5 of this bill applies the definition of “water already appropriated” to the
41 provisions of section 3. Section 8 of this bill applies the requirements of section 3 to
42 applications for reservoir permits, as applicable.
43 Section 4 of this bill requires the State Engineer to prepare and submit a biennial report to
44 the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislative Commission
45 relating to certain applications to appropriate water that have been pending before the State
46 Engineer for 2 or more years.
47 Under existing law, the State Engineer must notify an applicant by certified mail of any
48 written protest filed against the application and give notice of any hearing to be held on such a
49 protest by certified mail to both the applicant and protestant. If the State Engineer holds a
50 hearing regarding any filed protest, he or she must render a decision on the protested
51 application not later than 240 days after: (1) the transcripts of the hearing become available; or
52 (2) a date specified by the State Engineer for the filing of additional information. (NRS
53 533.365) Section 6 of this bill requires such notice to be provided by registered or certified
54 mail. Section 6 also limits the deadline for the State Engineer to render a decision on a protest
55 after a hearing to only those hearings on a protest to an application that seeks a temporary
56 change of place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already appropriated.
57 Existing law sets forth the conditions of and manner in which the State Engineer shall
58 approve or reject an application to appropriate water for beneficial use in Nevada, including
59 requiring the State Engineer, with certain exceptions, to approve or reject each application
60 within 2 years after the final date for filing a protest and to postpone taking action on an
61 application in specific instances. Existing law requires the State Engineer to issue a written
62 decision if a hearing is held regarding an application and that the decision include certain
63 findings of fact and conclusions of law. (NRS 533.370) Section 7 of this bill requires the State

Assembly Amendment No. 482 to Assembly Bill No. 419 Page 5
64 Engineer, with certain exceptions, to approve or reject each application within 1 year after the
65 issuance of a preliminary determination pursuant to section 3, if there was no objection filed
66 to the preliminary determination, or within 240 days after a hearing is held on an objection to
67 a preliminary determination or a protest. Section 7 also authorizes the State Engineer to
68 postpone taking action on an application under certain circumstances. Section 7 further
69 requires that if a hearing is held regarding an application, only the final decision by the State
70 Engineer must be in writing.
71 Existing law sets forth the procedures for judicial review of certain orders and decisions
72 of the State Engineer, including that a decision of the State Engineer is deemed prima facie
73 correct and that the burden of proof is on the party appealing the decision. (NRS 533.450)
74 Section 9 of this bill removes the presumption that the decision of the State Engineer is prima
75 facie correct and sets forth the standard of review for a court to review the decision.
76 Under existing law, any person, including a governmental entity who may be adversely
77 affected by a project for the recharge, storage and recovery of water, is authorized to file a
78 written protest with the State Engineer against the granting of an application for a permit to
79 operate such project. Existing law also requires the State Engineer, with certain exceptions, to
80 approve or deny an application for such a permit within 1 year after the final date for filing a
81 protest. (NRS 534.270) Section 10 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to issue a
82 preliminary determination on such an application and any protest within 120 days after the last
83 publication of the notice of the application and to provide notice of the preliminary
84 determination to the applicant and protestant, if any; (2) provides for an applicant or any
85 protestant to file an objection to the preliminary determination within 30 days after the
86 issuance of the preliminary determination; (3) requires the State Engineer to give an applicant
87 and any protestant notice of a filed objection within 15 days after filing; (4) requires, with
88 certain exceptions, the State Engineer to hold a hearing regarding an objection within 120
89 days after receipt of the objection and to provide notice of the hearing; and (5) authorizes the
90 State Engineer to postpone issuing a preliminary determination under certain circumstances.
91 Section 10 further requires the State Engineer, with certain exceptions, to either approve or
92 deny each application within 1 year after the issuance of a preliminary determination that is
93 not objected to, or within 1 year after the date of the hearing held regarding an objection to a
94 preliminary determination.]
95 Under existing law the State Engineer is exempt from the Nevada Administrative
96 Procedure Act, which establishes procedural requirements for the adoption of regulations and
97 the adjudication of contested cases. (Chapter 233B of NRS) Section 11 of this bill makes the
98 State Engineer subject to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act for purposes of adopting
99 regulations and certain provisions governing the adjudication of contested cases.

28 4. When beneficial use has been completed and perfected under the secondary
29 permit, and after the holder thereof shall have made proofs of the commencement

36 533.450 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 533.353, any person
37 feeling aggrieved by any order or decision of the State Engineer, acting in person or
38 through the assistants of the State Engineer or the water commissioner, affecting
39 the person’s interests, when the order or decision relates to the administration of
40 determined rights or is made pursuant to NRS 533.270 to 533.445, inclusive, and
41 section 3 of this act or NRS 533.481, 534.193, 535.200 or 536.200, may have the
42 same reviewed by a proceeding for that purpose, insofar as may be in the nature of
43 an appeal, which must be initiated in the proper court of the county in which the
44 matters affected or a portion thereof are situated, but on stream systems where a
45 decree of court has been entered, the action must be initiated in the court that
46 entered the decree. The order or decision of the State Engineer remains in full force
47 and effect unless proceedings to review the same are commenced in the proper
48 court within 30 days after the rendition of the order or decision in question and
49 notice thereof is given to the State Engineer as provided in subsection 3.
50 2. The proceedings in every case must be heard by the court, and must be
51 informal and summary, but full opportunity to be heard must be had before
52 judgment is pronounced.

Assembly Amendment No. 482 to Assembly Bill No. 419 Page 12
1 3. No such proceedings may be entertained unless notice thereof, containing a
2 statement of the substance of the order or decision complained of, and of the
3 manner in which the same injuriously affects the petitioner’s interests, has been
4 served upon the State Engineer, personally or by registered or certified mail, at the
5 Office of the State Engineer at the State Capital within 30 days following the
6 rendition of the order or decision in question. A similar notice must also be served
7 personally or by registered or certified mail upon the person who may have been
8 affected by the order or decision.
9 4. Where evidence has been filed with, or testimony taken before, the State
10 Engineer, a transcribed copy thereof, or of any specific part of the same, duly
11 certified as a true and correct transcript in the manner provided by law, must be
12 received in evidence with the same effect as if the reporter were present and
13 testified to the facts so certified. A copy of the transcript must be furnished on
14 demand, at actual cost, to any person affected by the order or decision, and to all
15 other persons on payment of a reasonable amount therefor, to be fixed by the State
16 Engineer.
17 5. An order or decision of the State Engineer must not be stayed unless the
18 petitioner files a written motion for a stay with the court and serves the motion
19 personally or by registered or certified mail upon the State Engineer, the applicant
20 or other real party in interest and each party of record within 10 days after the
21 petitioner files the petition for judicial review. Any party may oppose the motion
22 and the petitioner may reply to any such opposition. In determining whether to
23 grant or deny the motion for a stay, the court shall consider:
24 (a) Whether any nonmoving party to the proceeding may incur any harm or
25 hardship if the stay is granted;
26 (b) Whether the petitioner may incur any irreparable harm if the stay is denied;
27 (c) The likelihood of success of the petitioner on the merits; and
28 (d) Any potential harm to the members of the public if the stay is granted.
29 6. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the petitioner must file a
30 bond in an amount determined by the court, with sureties satisfactory to the court
31 and conditioned in the manner specified by the court. The bond must be filed within
32 5 days after the court determines the amount of the bond pursuant to this
33 subsection. If the petitioner fails to file the bond within that period, the stay is
34 automatically denied. A bond must not be required for a public agency of this State
35 or a political subdivision of this State.
36 7. Costs must be paid as in civil cases brought in the district court, except by
37 the State Engineer or the State.
38 8. The practice in civil cases applies to the informal and summary character of
39 such proceedings, as provided in this section.
40 9. Appeals may be taken to the appellate court of competent jurisdiction
41 pursuant to the rules fixed by the Supreme Court pursuant to Section 4 of Article 6
42 of the Nevada Constitution from the judgment of the district court in the same
43 manner as in other civil cases.
44 10. The [decision of the State Engineer is prima facie correct, and the] burden
45 of proof in any proceeding initiated pursuant to subsection 1 is upon the party
46 attacking the same.
47 11. The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the State Engineer
48 as to the weight of evidence on a question of fact. The court may remand or
49 affirm the final decision or set it aside in whole or in part if substantial rights of
50 the petitioner have been prejudiced because the final decision of the State
51 Engineer is:
52 (a) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;
53 (b) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;

Assembly Amendment No. 482 to Assembly Bill No. 419 Page 13
1 (c) Made upon unlawful procedure;
2 (d) Affected by other error of law;
3 (e) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial
4 evidence on the whole record; or
5 (f) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion.
6 12. Whenever it appears to the State Engineer that any litigation, whether now
7 pending or hereafter brought, may adversely affect the rights of the public in water,
8 the State Engineer shall request the Attorney General to appear and protect the
9 interests of the State.
10 13. As used in this section, “substantial evidence” means evidence which a
11 reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.] (Deleted by
