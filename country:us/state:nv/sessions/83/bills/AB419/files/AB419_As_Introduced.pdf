Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to make such reasonable
2 rules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper and orderly execution of
3 the powers conferred upon him or her by law, including regulations governing the
4 practice and procedure in all contests before the Office of the State Engineer. (NRS
5 532.120) Section 1 of this bill requires the State Engineer to adopt regulations: (1)
6 governing hearings before the Office; and (2) to establish a pre-application review
7 process for purposes of the provisions governing underground water and wells, the
8 adjudication of vested water rights and the appropriation of public water, which
9 must include procedures to submit an application for review for potential issues
10 prior to the filing of the application and to meet with the State Engineer or his or
11 her designee at the request of a potential applicant. (Chapters 533 and 534 of NRS)
12 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate water for beneficial
13 use in Nevada, or change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of
14 water already appropriated, is required to first apply for a permit to do so. (NRS
15 533.325) Existing law requires the State Engineer to publish notice of such an
16 application in certain newspapers of general publication and on the Internet website
17 of the Division of Water Resources of the State Department of Conservation and
18 Natural Resources. (NRS 533.360) Any interested person may file a written protest
19 against the granting of such an application with the State Engineer and the State
20 Engineer may hold a hearing regarding such a protest. (NRS 533.365) The State
21 Engineer is generally required to approve or reject the application within 2 years,
22 unless authorized to postpone taking action for certain reasons specified by law.
23 (NRS 533.370) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, the State
24 Engineer to issue a preliminary determination on an application and any protest to
25 the application within 150 days after the last publication of the notice of the
26 application, and to provide notice of the preliminary determination to the applicant
27 and each protestant, if any; (2) provides for an applicant or any protestant to file an
28 objection to the preliminary determination within 30 days after issuance; (3)
29 requires the State Engineer to give an applicant and any protestants notice of a filed
30 objection within 15 days after filing; (4) requires, with certain exceptions, the State
31 Engineer to hold a hearing regarding an objection within 120 days after receipt of
32 the objection and to provide notice of the hearing; and (5) authorizes the State
33 Engineer to postpone issuing a preliminary determination under certain conditions.
34 Section 5 of this bill applies the definition of “water already appropriated” to
35 the provisions of section 3. Section 8 of this bill applies the requirements of
36 section 3 to applications for reservoir permits, as applicable.
37 Section 4 of this bill requires the State Engineer to prepare and submit a
38 biennial report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to
39 the Legislative Commission relating to certain applications to appropriate water
40 that have been pending before the State Engineer for 2 or more years.
41 Under existing law, the State Engineer must notify an applicant by certified
42 mail of any written protest filed against the application and give notice of any
43 hearing to be held on such a protest by certified mail to both the applicant and
44 protestant. If the State Engineer holds a hearing regarding any filed protest, he or
45 she must render a decision on the protested application not later than 240 days
46 after: (1) the transcripts of the hearing become available; or (2) a date specified by
47 the State Engineer for the filing of additional information. (NRS 533.365) Section
48 6 of this bill requires such notice to be provided by registered or certified mail.
49 Section 6 also limits the deadline for the State Engineer to render a decision on a
50 protest after a hearing to only those hearings on a protest to an application that
51 seeks a temporary change of place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of
52 water already appropriated.
53 Existing law sets forth the conditions of and manner in which the State
54 Engineer shall approve or reject an application to appropriate water for beneficial
-

– 3 –
55 use in Nevada, including requiring the State Engineer, with certain exceptions, to
56 approve or reject each application within 2 years after the final date for filing a
57 protest and to postpone taking action on an application in specific instances.
58 Existing law requires the State Engineer to issue a written decision if a hearing is
59 held regarding an application and that the decision include certain findings of fact
60 and conclusions of law. (NRS 533.370) Section 7 of this bill requires the State
61 Engineer, with certain exceptions, to approve or reject each application within 1
62 year after the issuance of a preliminary determination pursuant to section 3, if there
63 was no objection filed to the preliminary determination, or within 240 days after a
64 hearing is held on an objection to a preliminary determination or a protest. Section
65 7 also authorizes the State Engineer to postpone taking action on an application
66 under certain circumstances. Section 7 further requires that if a hearing is held
67 regarding an application, only the final decision by the State Engineer must be in
68 writing.
69 Existing law sets forth the procedures for judicial review of certain orders and
70 decisions of the State Engineer, including that a decision of the State Engineer is
71 deemed prima facie correct and that the burden of proof is on the party appealing
72 the decision. (NRS 533.450) Section 9 of this bill removes the presumption that the
73 decision of the State Engineer is prima facie correct and sets forth the standard of
74 review for a court to review the decision.
75 Under existing law, any person, including a governmental entity who may be
76 adversely affected by a project for the recharge, storage and recovery of water, is
77 authorized to file a written protest with the State Engineer against the granting of an
78 application for a permit to operate such project. Existing law also requires the State
79 Engineer, with certain exceptions, to approve or deny an application for such a
80 permit within 1 year after the final date for filing a protest. (NRS 534.270) Section
81 10 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to issue a preliminary determination
82 on such an application and any protest within 120 days after the last publication of
83 the notice of the application and to provide notice of the preliminary determination

85 protestant to file an objection to the preliminary determination within 30 days after
86 the issuance of the preliminary determination; (3) requires the State Engineer to
87 give an applicant and any protestant notice of a filed objection within 15 days after
88 filing; (4) requires, with certain exceptions, the State Engineer to hold a hearing
89 regarding an objection within 120 days after receipt of the objection and to provide
90 notice of the hearing; and (5) authorizes the State Engineer to postpone issuing a
91 preliminary determination under certain circumstances. Section 10 further requires
92 the State Engineer, with certain exceptions, to either approve or deny each
93 application within 1 year after the issuance of a preliminary determination that is
94 not objected to, or within 1 year after the date of the hearing held regarding an
95 objection to a preliminary determination.
96 Under existing law the State Engineer is exempt from the Nevada
97 Administrative Procedure Act, which establishes procedural requirements for the
98 adoption of regulations and the adjudication of contested cases. (Chapter 233B of
99 NRS) Section 11 of this bill makes the State Engineer subject to the Nevada
100 Administrative Procedure Act for purposes of adopting regulations and certain
101 provisions governing the adjudication of contested cases.

9 533.324 to 533.435, inclusive, and section 3 of this act, except that
10 no notice of such application shall be published.
11 2. The application shall refer to the reservoir for a supply of
12 water and shall show by documentary evidence that an agreement
13 has been entered into with the owner of the reservoir for a
14 permanent and sufficient interest in such reservoir to impound
15 enough water for the purpose set forth in the application.
16 3. Effluent discharged from the point of the final treatment
17 from within a sewage collection and treatment system shall be
18 considered water as referred to in this chapter, and shall be subject

21 shall preclude appropriation in accordance with and subject to the
22 provisions of NRS 533.324 to 533.435, inclusive [.] , and section 3
23 of this act.
24 4. When beneficial use has been completed and perfected

28 of other permits, as provided in this chapter, a final certificate of
29 appropriation shall issue as other certificates are issued, except that
30 the certificate shall refer to both the works described in the
31 secondary permit and the reservoir described in the primary permit.
32 Sec. 9. NRS 533.450 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 533.450 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 533.353,
34 any person feeling aggrieved by any order or decision of the State
35 Engineer, acting in person or through the assistants of the State
36 Engineer or the water commissioner, affecting the person’s interests,
37 when the order or decision relates to the administration of
38 determined rights or is made pursuant to NRS 533.270 to 533.445,
39 inclusive, and section 3 of this act or NRS 533.481, 534.193,
40 535.200 or 536.200, may have the same reviewed by a proceeding
41 for that purpose, insofar as may be in the nature of an appeal, which
42 must be initiated in the proper court of the county in which the
43 matters affected or a portion thereof are situated, but on stream
44 systems where a decree of court has been entered, the action must be
45 initiated in the court that entered the decree. The order or decision of
-
*AB419*

– 12 –
1 the State Engineer remains in full force and effect unless
2 proceedings to review the same are commenced in the proper court
3 within 30 days after the rendition of the order or decision in
4 question and notice thereof is given to the State Engineer as
5 provided in subsection 3.
6 2. The proceedings in every case must be heard by the court,
7 and must be informal and summary, but full opportunity to be heard
8 must be had before judgment is pronounced.
9 3. No such proceedings may be entertained unless notice
10 thereof, containing a statement of the substance of the order or
11 decision complained of, and of the manner in which the same
12 injuriously affects the petitioner’s interests, has been served upon
13 the State Engineer, personally or by registered or certified mail, at
14 the Office of the State Engineer at the State Capital within 30 days
15 following the rendition of the order or decision in question. A
16 similar notice must also be served personally or by registered or
17 certified mail upon the person who may have been affected by the
18 order or decision.
19 4. Where evidence has been filed with, or testimony taken
20 before, the State Engineer, a transcribed copy thereof, or of any
21 specific part of the same, duly certified as a true and correct
22 transcript in the manner provided by law, must be received in
23 evidence with the same effect as if the reporter were present and
24 testified to the facts so certified. A copy of the transcript must be
25 furnished on demand, at actual cost, to any person affected by the
26 order or decision, and to all other persons on payment of a
27 reasonable amount therefor, to be fixed by the State Engineer.
28 5. An order or decision of the State Engineer must not be
29 stayed unless the petitioner files a written motion for a stay with the
30 court and serves the motion personally or by registered or certified
31 mail upon the State Engineer, the applicant or other real party in
32 interest and each party of record within 10 days after the petitioner
33 files the petition for judicial review. Any party may oppose the
34 motion and the petitioner may reply to any such opposition. In
35 determining whether to grant or deny the motion for a stay, the court
36 shall consider:
37 (a) Whether any nonmoving party to the proceeding may incur
38 any harm or hardship if the stay is granted;
39 (b) Whether the petitioner may incur any irreparable harm if the
40 stay is denied;
41 (c) The likelihood of success of the petitioner on the merits; and
42 (d) Any potential harm to the members of the public if the stay
43 is granted.
44 6. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
45 petitioner must file a bond in an amount determined by the court,
-
*AB419*

– 13 –
1 with sureties satisfactory to the court and conditioned in the manner
2 specified by the court. The bond must be filed within 5 days after
3 the court determines the amount of the bond pursuant to this
4 subsection. If the petitioner fails to file the bond within that period,
5 the stay is automatically denied. A bond must not be required for a
6 public agency of this State or a political subdivision of this State.
7 7. Costs must be paid as in civil cases brought in the district
8 court, except by the State Engineer or the State.
9 8. The practice in civil cases applies to the informal and
10 summary character of such proceedings, as provided in this section.
11 9. Appeals may be taken to the appellate court of competent
12 jurisdiction pursuant to the rules fixed by the Supreme Court
13 pursuant to Section 4 of Article 6 of the Nevada Constitution from
14 the judgment of the district court in the same manner as in other
15 civil cases.
16 10. The [decision of the State Engineer is prima facie correct,
17 and the] burden of proof in any proceeding initiated pursuant to
18 subsection 1 is upon the party attacking the same.
19 11. The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the
20 State Engineer as to the weight of evidence on a question of fact.
21 The court may remand or affirm the final decision or set it aside
22 in whole or in part if substantial rights of the petitioner have been
23 prejudiced because the final decision of the State Engineer is:
24 (a) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;
25 (b) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;
26 (c) Made upon unlawful procedure;
27 (d) Affected by other error of law;
28 (e) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and
29 substantial evidence on the whole record; or
30 (f) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of
31 discretion.
32 12. Whenever it appears to the State Engineer that any
33 litigation, whether now pending or hereafter brought, may adversely
34 affect the rights of the public in water, the State Engineer shall
35 request the Attorney General to appear and protect the interests of
36 the State.
37 13. As used in this section, “substantial evidence” means
38 evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
39 support a conclusion.
40 Sec. 10. NRS 534.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 534.270 1. Upon receipt of an application for a permit to

37 6. Within 120 days after the date of last publication of the
38 notice of the application pursuant to subsection 2, the State
39 Engineer shall issue a preliminary determination on the
