~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to peace officers; authorizing the employment as
peace officers of persons who are legally authorized to
work in the United States under federal law; prohibiting
the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission
from adopting certain regulations; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law requires any officer of the State of
2 Nevada or any political subdivision of the State or any person acting under or for
3 such an officer in any office or department of the State or political subdivision of
4 the State to employ only citizens or wards of the United States. (NRS 281.060)
5 Section 1 of this bill creates an exception to this limitation, effective on January 1,
6 2026, by authorizing the employment as peace officers of persons who are legally
7 authorized to work in the United States under federal law and who satisfy all other
8 applicable limitations on or requirements relating to the employment of peace
9 officers.
10 Existing law requires the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission
11 to adopt regulations establishing minimum standards for the certification and
12 decertification, recruitment, selection and training of peace officers. (NRS 289.510)
13 Section 2 of this bill prohibits the Commission from adopting regulations that
14 require citizenship of the United States for the appointment of a person as a peace
15 officer, if the person is legally authorized to work in the United States under federal
16 law and satisfies all other applicable limitations on or requirements relating to the
17 employment of peace officers. Section 3 of this bill voids any existing regulations
18 that conflict with this change.
