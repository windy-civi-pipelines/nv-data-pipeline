FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to peace officers; authorizing the employment as peace officers of
persons who are legally authorized to work in the United States under
federal law [;] and have been employed as a peace officer in another
state; prohibiting the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training
Commission from adopting certain regulations; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law requires any officer of the State of Nevada or any
2 political subdivision of the State or any person acting under or for such an officer in any office
3 or department of the State or political subdivision of the State to employ only citizens or
4 wards of the United States. (NRS 281.060) Section 1 of this bill creates an exception to this
5 limitation, effective on January 1, 2026, by authorizing the employment as peace officers of
6 persons who : (1) are legally authorized to work in the United States under federal law ; (2)
7 have been employed as a peace officer in another state; and (3) who satisfy all other
8 applicable limitations on or requirements relating to the employment of peace officers.
9 Existing law requires the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission to adopt
10 regulations establishing minimum standards for the certification and decertification,
11 recruitment, selection and training of peace officers. (NRS 289.510) Section 2 of this bill
12 prohibits the Commission from adopting regulations that require citizenship of the United
13 States for the appointment of a person as a peace officer, if the person : (1) is legally
14 authorized to work in the United States under federal law ; (2) has been employed as a peace
15 officer in another state; and (3) satisfies all other applicable limitations on or requirements
16 relating to the employment of peace officers. Section 3 of this bill voids any existing
17 regulations that conflict with this change.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 281.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 281.060 1. [Only] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, only
3 citizens or wards of the United States or persons who have been honorably
4 discharged from the military service of the United States may be employed by any
5 officer of the State of Nevada, by any political subdivision of the State, or by any
Senate Amendment No. 498 to Senate Bill No. 155 Page 4
1 person acting under or for such an officer in any office or department of the State of
2 Nevada or political subdivision of the State.
3 2. In all cases where persons are so employed, preference must be given, if
4 the qualifications of the applicants are equal:
5 (a) First: To honorably discharged military personnel of the United States who
6 are citizens of the State of Nevada.
7 (b) Second: To other citizens of the State of Nevada.
8 3. Nothing in this section prevents:
9 (a) The working of prisoners by the State of Nevada or by any political
10 subdivision of the State, on street or road work or other public work.
11 (b) The employment of aliens, who have not forfeited their right to citizenship
12 by claiming exemption from military service, as common laborers in the
13 construction of public roads, when it can be shown that citizens or wards of the
14 United States or persons who have been honorably discharged from the military
15 service of the United States are not available for such employment. Any alien so
16 employed must be replaced by a citizen, ward or ex-service person of the United
17 States applying for employment.
18 (c) The employment of any teacher, instructor or professor authorized to teach
19 in the United States under the teacher-exchange programs as authorized by federal
20 laws enacted by the Congress of the United States.
21 (d) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the employment of aliens
22 by the Nevada System of Higher Education in the technical, graduate assistant and

25 and student categories may be aliens.
26 (e) Employment of aliens in any state or political subdivision hospital.

31 chapter 289 of NRS. As used in this paragraph, “peace officer” has the meaning
32 ascribed to it in NRS 289.010.
33 4. Subject to the exceptions contained in this section, money must not be paid
34 out of the State Treasury or out of the treasury of any political subdivision of the
35 State to any person employed on any of the work mentioned in this section unless
36 the person is a citizen or ward or naturalized citizen of the United States.
37 5. Any officer of the State of Nevada, or of any political subdivision of the
38 State, or any person acting under or for such an officer, or any other person who
39 violates any of the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. The

41 misrepresentations made by the employee by the production of fraudulent papers
42 evidencing citizenship in the United States.
43 Sec. 2. NRS 289.510 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 289.510 1. The Commission:

6 training to and certification of persons employed as police officers by that Indian
7 tribe.
8 (g) Shall develop and approve a standard curriculum of certified training
9 programs in crisis intervention, which may be made available in an electronic
10 format, and which address specialized responses to persons with mental illness and
11 train peace officers to identify the signs and symptoms of mental illness, to de-
12 escalate situations involving persons who appear to be experiencing a behavioral
13 health crisis and, if appropriate, to connect such persons to treatment. A peace
14 officer who completes any program developed pursuant to this paragraph must be
15 issued a certificate of completion.
16 2. The Commission shall adopt regulations establishing minimum standards
17 for:

19 peace officers. The standards adopted pursuant to this paragraph must:

43 or vulnerable persons;
44 (8) Not prohibit the certification of an applicant solely on the basis that the
45 applicant has engaged in the adult use of cannabis or the medical use of cannabis;
46 (9) Not require the decertification of a peace officer solely on the basis that
47 the peace officer has engaged in the adult use of cannabis or the medical use of

50 the Commission that the peace officer knowingly provided false or misleading
51 information in his or her application for certification.
Senate Amendment No. 498 to Senate Bill No. 155 Page 6
1 (b) An annual behavioral wellness visit for peace officers to aid in preserving
2 the emotional and mental health of the peace officer and assessing any conditions
3 that may affect the performance of duties by the peace officer.

5 officer or its equivalent by the certifying authority of another state or who has
6 successfully completed a federal law enforcement training program that is
7 equivalent to a category III peace officer in this State.
8 3. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to subsection 2:
9 (a) Apply to all agencies of this State and of local governments in this State
10 that employ persons as peace officers; [and]
11 (b) May require that training be carried on at institutions which it approves in
12 those regulations [.] ; and

16 officer in another state and satisfies all other applicable limitations on or
17 requirements relating to the employment of peace officers imposed pursuant to
18 this chapter.
19 4. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a law enforcement
20 agency from adopting a policy that requires a peace officer to submit to a screening
21 test as:
22 (a) A condition precedent to employment; or
23 (b) A condition for continued employment.
24 Sec. 3. Any provision of a regulation adopted by the Peace Officers’
25 Standards and Training Commission that conflicts with the amendatory provisions
26 of this act is void. The Legislative Counsel shall remove any such provision of a
27 regulation adopted by the Commission as soon as practicable after January 1, 2026.
28 Sec. 4. This act becomes effective on January 1, 2026.
