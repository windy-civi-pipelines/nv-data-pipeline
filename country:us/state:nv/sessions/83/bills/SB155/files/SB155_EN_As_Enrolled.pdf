Senate Bill No. 155–Senator Flores
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to peace officers; authorizing the employment as
peace officers of persons who are legally authorized to work
in the United States under federal law and have been
employed as a peace officer in another state; prohibiting the
Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission from
adopting certain regulations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
With certain exceptions, existing law requires any officer of the State of
Nevada or any political subdivision of the State or any person acting under or for
such an officer in any office or department of the State or political subdivision of
the State to employ only citizens or wards of the United States. (NRS 281.060)
Section 1 of this bill creates an exception to this limitation, effective on January 1,
2026, by authorizing the employment as peace officers of persons who: (1) are
legally authorized to work in the United States under federal law; (2) have been
employed as a peace officer in another state; and (3) who satisfy all other
applicable limitations on or requirements relating to the employment of peace
officers.
Existing law requires the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission
to adopt regulations establishing minimum standards for the certification and
decertification, recruitment, selection and training of peace officers. (NRS 289.510)
Section 2 of this bill prohibits the Commission from adopting regulations that
require citizenship of the United States for the appointment of a person as a peace
officer, if the person: (1) is legally authorized to work in the United States under
federal law; (2) has been employed as a peace officer in another state; and (3)
satisfies all other applicable limitations on or requirements relating to the
employment of peace officers. Section 3 of this bill voids any existing regulations
that conflict with this change.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 281.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
281.060 1. [Only] Except as otherwise provided in
subsection 3, only citizens or wards of the United States or persons
who have been honorably discharged from the military service of
the United States may be employed by any officer of the State of
Nevada, by any political subdivision of the State, or by any person
acting under or for such an officer in any office or department of the
State of Nevada or political subdivision of the State.
2. In all cases where persons are so employed, preference must
be given, if the qualifications of the applicants are equal:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
(a) First: To honorably discharged military personnel of the
United States who are citizens of the State of Nevada.
(b) Second: To other citizens of the State of Nevada.
3. Nothing in this section prevents:
(a) The working of prisoners by the State of Nevada or by any
political subdivision of the State, on street or road work or other
public work.
(b) The employment of aliens, who have not forfeited their right
to citizenship by claiming exemption from military service, as
common laborers in the construction of public roads, when it can be
shown that citizens or wards of the United States or persons who
have been honorably discharged from the military service of the
United States are not available for such employment. Any alien so
employed must be replaced by a citizen, ward or ex-service person
of the United States applying for employment.
(c) The employment of any teacher, instructor or professor
authorized to teach in the United States under the teacher-exchange
programs as authorized by federal laws enacted by the Congress of
the United States.

hospital.

any political subdivision of the State to any person employed on any
of the work mentioned in this section unless the person is a citizen

subdivision of the State, or any person acting under or for such an
