1 Existing law requires each applicant for licensure as an ambulance attendant or

4 concerning identifying and interacting with persons with developmental disabilities
5 before initial licensure or certification, as applicable. (NRS 289.605, 450B.160,
6 450B.180) Existing law provides that a person who is required to obtain such

10 ambulance attendant or a firefighter or certification as an emergency medical
11 technician, an advanced emergency medical technician, a paramedic or a peace

13 with dementia and other cognitive impairments. Section 5 of this bill requires a
14 person who is licensed as an ambulance attendant or a firefighter or certified as an

16 paramedic or a peace officer to submit to his or her licensing authority on or before
