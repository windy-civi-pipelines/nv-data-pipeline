Joint Sponsors: Assemblymembers Goulding and Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to emergency response; authorizing the adoption
of regulations requiring applicants for certification as an
emergency medical technician, advanced emergency medical
technician or paramedic to have completed training relating
to care for elderly persons and persons with cognitive
impairments; providing that receiving such training does not
change the standard of care to which such first responders are
held; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires each applicant for certification as an emergency medical
technician, advanced emergency medical technician or paramedic to complete
training concerning identifying and interacting with persons with developmental
disabilities before initial certification. (NRS 450B.180) Existing law provides that a
person who is required to obtain such training is not held to a higher standard of
care and does not have a greater duty because he or she has received such training.
(NRS 41.1391)
Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes a district board of health in a county whose
population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) or the State Board of
Health, for all other counties, to adopt regulations requiring an applicant for
certification as an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency medical
technician or paramedic to have completed training relating to identifying,
interacting with and providing care to elderly persons and persons who are
cognitively impaired. Section 1.5 requires any such training to be developed and
provided in collaboration with a nationally accredited or certified program with
expertise in care for elderly persons and persons who are cognitively impaired.
Section 3 of this bill provides that an emergency medical technician, advanced
emergency medical technician or paramedic is not held to a higher standard of care
and does not have a greater duty because he or she has received any training
required by section 1.5.
