(BDR 17-1251)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Legislative Department; clarifying that
proceeds of sales of certain items approved by the
Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau must be
deposited in the Legislative Fund; clarifying that the
organization of the Nevada Revised Statutes into titles by
the Legislative Counsel does not constitute a legislative
determination for certain constitutional purposes; placing
a certain parcel of land under the exclusive supervision
and control of the Legislature, contingent upon its
purchase; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) creates the Legislative Fund as a special revenue fund for the
2 use of the Legislative Department of the State Government; (2) provides that
3 money in the Legislative Fund does not revert to the State General Fund; and (3)
4 requires money to be paid out of the Legislative Fund only on claims approved by
5 the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau or his or her designee. (NRS
6 218A.150) Existing law further provides that when various items or services
7 provided at the expense of the Legislative Fund are sold, the proceeds from such
8 sales are deposited in the Legislative Fund. (NRS 218F.410-218F.440) Section 2 of
9 this bill clarifies that proceeds from the sales of food or other items in the
10 Legislative Building or any building maintained for the use of the Legislature or the
11 Legislative Counsel Bureau must be similarly deposited in the Legislative Fund.
12 Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the petty cash account
-
*AB600*
– 2 –
13 of the Legislative Counsel Bureau to account for the clarification made by section
14 2.
15 Existing law reserves the powers and duties relating to the revision of statutes
16 and the compilation, organization, revision and publication of the Nevada Revised
17 Statutes to the Legislative Counsel and the Legal Division of the Legislative
18 Counsel Bureau. (Chapter 220 of NRS) Specifically, the Legislative Counsel is: (1)
19 required to classify and arrange the entire body of statute laws in logical order
20 throughout the volumes of the Nevada Revised Statutes to enable subjects of a
21 kindred nature to be placed under one general head; and (2) authorized to create
22 new titles, chapters and sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes as may be required
23 to effectuate the orderly and logical arrangement of the statutes. (NRS 220.120)
24 In prior opinions, the Nevada Supreme Court has recognized that, based on the
25 separation-of-powers provision in the Nevada Constitution, each state office,
26 agency, court or other entity “must have a primary connection to and derive its
27 power to act from one of the three branches of Nevada government.” (Comm’n on
28 Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 298, 212 P.3d 1098, 1107 (2009); Whitehead v.
29 Nev. Comm’n on Jud. Discipline, 110 Nev. 128, 159, 906 P.2d 230, 249 (1994);
30 Galloway v. Truesdell, 83 Nev. 13, 19, 422 P.2d 237, 241 (1967) (“The
31 Constitution of the State of Nevada distributes governmental powers into the
32 Legislative, Executive and Judicial departments; and each department is separate
33 from the others.”). However, in a recent opinion, the Nevada Supreme Court
34 erroneously construed the Legislative Counsel’s decisions in organizing the Nevada
35 Revised Statutes by title, distinguished by subject, as required by law, to be a
36 decision by the Legislature which “indicated its understanding” that certain
37 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government fall outside “the
38 three departments of state government.” (Nev. Policy Research Institute, Inc. v.
39 Miller, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 69, 558 P.3d 319, 327 (2024))
40 Section 3 of this bill provides that each state office, agency, court or other
41 entity must have a primary connection to and be part of one of the three
42 departments of the State Government, and no state office, agency, court or other
43 entity is created, exists or functions outside of the three departments of the State
44 Government. Section 3 also: (1) clarifies that the Legislative Counsel’s decisions in
45 organizing the Nevada Revised Statutes to effectuate the orderly and logical
46 arrangement of the statutes and to classify the body of statute law by subject matter,
47 as required by law, is not a decision by the Legislature as to which department of
48 the State Government any state office, agency, court or other entity is located or to
49 exclude any state office, agency, court or other entity from the three departments of
50 the State Government; and (2) prohibits construing the organization of the Nevada
51 Revised Statutes in such a manner.
52 Existing law reserves to the Legislature the supervision and control of the
53 property of the Legislative Department and requires title to such property to be held
54 in the name of the Legislature of the State of Nevada. (NRS 331.135) Contingent
55 upon the completion of the purchase of a certain parcel of land in Carson City,
56 section 4 of this bill includes the parcel among the property for which supervision
57 and control is reserved to the Legislature.
