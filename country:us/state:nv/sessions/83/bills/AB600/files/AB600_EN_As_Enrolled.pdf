Assembly Bill No. 600–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the Legislative Department; clarifying that
proceeds of sales of certain items approved by the Director of
the Legislative Counsel Bureau must be deposited in the
Legislative Fund; clarifying that the organization of the
Nevada Revised Statutes into titles by the Legislative
Counsel does not constitute a legislative determination for
certain constitutional purposes; placing a certain parcel of
land under the exclusive supervision and control of the
Legislature, contingent upon its purchase; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) creates the Legislative Fund as a special revenue fund for the
use of the Legislative Department of the State Government; (2) provides that
money in the Legislative Fund does not revert to the State General Fund; and (3)
requires money to be paid out of the Legislative Fund only on claims approved by
the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau or his or her designee. (NRS
218A.150) Existing law further provides that when various items or services
provided at the expense of the Legislative Fund are sold, the proceeds from such
sales are deposited in the Legislative Fund. (NRS 218F.410-218F.440) Section 2 of
this bill clarifies that proceeds from the sales of food or other items in the
Legislative Building or any building maintained for the use of the Legislature or the
Legislative Counsel Bureau must be similarly deposited in the Legislative Fund.
Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the petty cash account
of the Legislative Counsel Bureau to account for the clarification made by
section 2.
Existing law reserves the powers and duties relating to the revision of statutes
and the compilation, organization, revision and publication of the Nevada Revised
Statutes to the Legislative Counsel and the Legal Division of the Legislative
Counsel Bureau. (Chapter 220 of NRS) Specifically, the Legislative Counsel is: (1)
required to classify and arrange the entire body of statute laws in logical order
throughout the volumes of the Nevada Revised Statutes to enable subjects of a
kindred nature to be placed under one general head; and (2) authorized to create
new titles, chapters and sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes as may be required
to effectuate the orderly and logical arrangement of the statutes. (NRS 220.120)
In prior opinions, the Nevada Supreme Court has recognized that, based on the
separation-of-powers provision in the Nevada Constitution, each state office,
agency, court or other entity “must have a primary connection to and derive its
power to act from one of the three branches of Nevada government.” (Comm’n on
Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 298, 212 P.3d 1098, 1107 (2009); Whitehead v.
Nev. Comm’n on Jud. Discipline, 110 Nev. 128, 159, 906 P.2d 230, 249 (1994);
Galloway v. Truesdell, 83 Nev. 13, 19, 422 P.2d 237, 241 (1967) (“The
Constitution of the State of Nevada distributes governmental powers into the
Legislative, Executive and Judicial departments; and each department is separate
from the others.”). However, in a recent opinion, the Nevada Supreme Court
erroneously construed the Legislative Counsel’s decisions in organizing the Nevada
Revised Statutes by title, distinguished by subject, as required by law, to be a
-

decision by the Legislature which “indicated its understanding” that certain
agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government fall outside “the
three departments of state government.” (Nev. Policy Research Institute, Inc. v.
Miller, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 69, 558 P.3d 319, 327 (2024))
Section 3 of this bill provides that each state office, agency, court or other
entity must have a primary connection to and be part of one of the three
departments of the State Government, and no state office, agency, court or other
entity is created, exists or functions outside of the three departments of the State
Government. Section 3 also: (1) clarifies that the Legislative Counsel’s decisions in
organizing the Nevada Revised Statutes to effectuate the orderly and logical
arrangement of the statutes and to classify the body of statute law by subject matter,
as required by law, is not a decision by the Legislature as to which department of
the State Government any state office, agency, court or other entity is located or to
exclude any state office, agency, court or other entity from the three departments of
the State Government; and (2) prohibits construing the organization of the Nevada
Revised Statutes in such a manner.
Existing law reserves to the Legislature the supervision and control of the
property of the Legislative Department and requires title to such property to be held
in the name of the Legislature of the State of Nevada. (NRS 331.135) Contingent
upon the completion of the purchase of a certain parcel of land in Carson City,
section 4 of this bill includes the parcel among the property for which supervision
and control is reserved to the Legislature.

Bureau. Such souvenirs may include, without limitation, souvenir
wine. The Director shall fix reasonable fees for the items which
must in the aggregate at least cover the cost to the Legislative
Counsel Bureau of purchasing and selling the items.
2. The money received from the sale of food, souvenirs and
other items must be deposited in a revolving account in the
Legislative Fund. The money in the revolving account must be used
to purchase additional food, souvenirs or other items for sale and
pay any other expenses related to the sale of food, souvenirs and
other items deemed appropriate by the Director. The balance in the
revolving account not exceeding $150,000 must not be reverted to
the Legislative Fund at the end of the fiscal year.
Sec. 3. The preliminary chapter of NRS is hereby amended by
adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
1. Each state office, agency, court or other entity must have a
primary connection to and be part of one of the three departments
of the State Government, and no state office, agency, court or
other entity is created, exists or functions outside of the three
departments of the State Government pursuant to Section 1 of
Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution.
2. The exercise of the Legislative Counsel’s duties as
prescribed in chapter 220 of NRS relating to the compilation,
organization, revision and publication of the Nevada Revised
Statutes is performed in the interest of effectuating the orderly and
logical arrangement of the statutes and shall not be construed as a
decision by the Legislature as to which department of the State
Government any state office, agency, court or other entity is
located or to exclude any state office, agency, court or other entity
from the three departments of the State Government pursuant to
Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution.
3. To effectuate the orderly and logical arrangement of the
statutes, to classify and arrange the entire body of statute law in
logical order and place subjects of a kindred nature under one
general head and to avoid any individual title becoming unwieldy
in length, statutes relating to the various state offices, agencies or
other entities of the Executive Department of the State
Government are codified in numerous titles of NRS, including,
without limitation, titles 7 to 12, inclusive, 14, 16, 18, 19 and 22 to
58, inclusive, of NRS, and distinguished by subject matter, and the
organization of the titles of the Nevada Revised Statutes by subject
matter shall not be construed as a decision by the Legislature to
exclude any of those state offices, agencies or other entities from
