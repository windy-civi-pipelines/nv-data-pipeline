AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions governing the
commitment and release of incompetent criminal defendants; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a defendant who is
2 charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies because the court finds that
3 the defendant is incompetent with no substantial probability of attaining competence in the
4 foreseeable future, the prosecuting attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a
5 hearing to determine whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the
6 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
7 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the prosecuting
8 attorney to file such a motion only if the person was previously ordered to receive treatment to
9 competency in an attempt to cause the person to attain competency to stand trial or receive
10 pronouncement of judgment for a felony charge that was dismissed. Section 1.5 also requires
11 the prosecuting attorney to serve the motion upon the Division.
12 Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to determine
13 whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to request from the Division a
14 comprehensive risk assessment which indicates whether the person requires the level of
15 security provided by a forensic facility. (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 instead requires the
16 prosecuting attorney to include a request for an order directing the Division to complete a
17 comprehensive risk assessment in the motion for a hearing. Section 1.5 also [: (1)] requires
18 the court [to hold a hearing to determine whether] to issue [such] an [order; and (2) provides
19 that if the court determines such an order should be issued, the court must file the] order
20 directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk assessment not later than 5
21 judicial days after the date [of] on which the [hearing. Section 1 of this bill makes a
22 conforming change to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 1.5.] motion
23 is filed.
24 Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of the
25 Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional release. If a
26 person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1) periodically review the
27 eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional release; and (2) discharge the person

Senate Amendment No. 921 to Assembly Bill No. 550 First Reprint Page 4
28 from conditional release if, upon review, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
29 the person no longer poses a danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2
30 of this bill provides that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the State and
31 any of its agents or employees are not liable for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or
32 medical expenses incurred by the person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions of the
33 person.
