SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing incompetent criminal
defendants. (BDR 14-1120)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions
governing the commitment and release of incompetent
criminal defendants; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a
2 defendant who is charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies
3 because the court finds that the defendant is incompetent with no substantial
4 probability of attaining competence in the foreseeable future, the prosecuting
5 attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
6 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the Division of
7 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
8 (NRS 178.461) Section 1 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the
9 prosecuting attorney to file such a motion only if the person received treatment to
10 competency. Section 1 also requires the prosecuting attorney to notify the court and
11 the Division, within a prescribed period, of his or her intent to seek an order
12 committing the person to the custody of the Administrator.
13 Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to
14 determine whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to
15 request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates
16 whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic facility.
17 (NRS 178.461) Section 1 instead requires the prosecuting attorney to petition the
18 court for an order requiring the Division to complete a comprehensive risk
19 assessment. Section 1 also provides that if the comprehensive risk assessment
20 indicates that the person assessed does not require the level of security provided by
21 a forensic facility, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person does not require
22 placement at a forensic facility.

23 Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of
24 the Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional
25 release. If a person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1)
26 periodically review the eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional
27 release; and (2) discharge the person from conditional release if, upon review, the
28 court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person no longer poses a
29 danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2 of this bill provides
30 that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the facility from which
31 the person is discharged and any agents or employees of the facility are not liable
32 for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or medical expenses incurred by the
33 person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions of the person.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 178.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is
3 charged with any category A felony or a category B felony listed in
4 subsection 6 are dismissed pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 178.425
5 [,] and the defendant received treatment to competency, the
6 prosecuting attorney may, within 10 judicial days after the
7 dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
8 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator
9 pursuant to subsection 3. The prosecuting attorney must, within 10
10 judicial days after receipt of the report set forth in NRS 178.450,
11 notify the court and the Division of his or her intent to seek an
12 order committing the person to the custody of the Administrator
13 pursuant to subsection 3.
14 2. If the prosecuting attorney files a motion pursuant to
15 subsection 1, the prosecuting attorney shall, not later than the date
16 on which the prosecuting attorney files the motion, [request from]
17 petition the court for an order requiring the Division to complete a
18 comprehensive risk assessment which indicates whether the person
19 requires the level of security provided by a forensic facility. The
20 Division shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
21 complete the comprehensive risk assessment within 40 calendar
22 days after [receipt of] the [request] court issues the order and
23 provide the comprehensive risk assessment to the court, the
24 prosecuting attorney and counsel for the person. The court may
25 grant the Division an extension to complete the comprehensive risk
26 assessment upon a showing of good cause. Within 10 judicial days
27 after receipt of the comprehensive risk assessment, the court shall
28 hold a hearing on the motion. If the [person was charged with any
29 category A felony other than murder or sexual assault or a category
30 B felony listed in subsection 6 and the] comprehensive risk
31 assessment indicates that the person does not require the level of
-

8 placement at a forensic facility, the court may order:

10 transport the person to a forensic facility; and
11 (b) That the person be committed to the custody of the
12 Administrator and kept under observation until the person is eligible

39 applicable, and:
40 (a) Was charged with murder or sexual assault; and
41 (b) Was committed to the custody of the Administrator pursuant

1 8. The court may grant a motion for an extension of the length
2 of commitment pursuant to subsection 7 if, at a hearing conducted
3 on the motion, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that

5 person’s dangerousness is such that the person requires placement at
6 a forensic facility.
7 9. At a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 8, a person
8 who is committed has the right to be represented by counsel. If the

14 the court which committed the person for conditional release.
15 2. A person who is committed to the custody of the

23 prosecuting attorney, the counsel for the person and the team that

25 (c) The court which committed the person has approved the
26 conditional release.
27 3. If a person is serving a period of conditional release pursuant
28 to this section, the court must, at least once every 12 months, review
29 the eligibility of the defendant for discharge from conditional
30 release. If, at the conclusion of the review required by this
31 subsection, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
32 person is not a danger to himself or herself or others, the court must
33 discharge the person from conditional release. When a person is
34 discharged from conditional release pursuant to this subsection,
35 the facility from which the person is discharged and its agents or
36 employees are not liable for any debts or contractual obligations,
37 medical or otherwise, incurred or damages caused by the actions
38 of the person.
39 4. The length of the period of conditional release must not
40 exceed 10 years, including any time that the person has been
