SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing incompetent criminal
defendants. (BDR 14-1120)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions
governing the commitment and release of incompetent
criminal defendants; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a
2 defendant who is charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies
3 because the court finds that the defendant is incompetent with no substantial
4 probability of attaining competence in the foreseeable future, the prosecuting
5 attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
6 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the Division of
7 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
8 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the
9 prosecuting attorney to file such a motion only if the person was previously ordered
10 to receive treatment to competency in an attempt to cause the person to attain
11 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment for a felony
12 charge that was dismissed. Section 1.5 also requires the prosecuting attorney to
13 serve the motion upon the Division.
14 Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to
15 determine whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to
16 request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates
17 whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic facility.
18 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 instead requires the prosecuting attorney to include a
19 request for an order directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk
20 assessment in the motion for a hearing. Section 1.5 also: (1) requires the court to
21 hold a hearing to determine whether to issue such an order; and (2) provides that if
22 the court determines such an order should be issued, the court must file the order
-
*AB550_R1*
– 2 –
23 not later than 5 judicial days after the date of the hearing. Section 1 of this bill
24 makes a conforming change to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by
25 section 1.5.
26 Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of
27 the Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional
28 release. If a person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1)
29 periodically review the eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional
30 release; and (2) discharge the person from conditional release if, upon review, the
31 court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person no longer poses a
32 danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2 of this bill provides
33 that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the State and any of its
34 agents or employees are not liable for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or
35 medical expenses incurred by the person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions
36 of the person.

6 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
7 team on their report.
8 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
9 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
10 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
11 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
12 county.
13 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
14 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a
15 finding of competence or incompetence, and if the judge finds the

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing incompetent criminal
defendants. (BDR 14-1120)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions
governing the commitment and release of incompetent
criminal defendants; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a
2 defendant who is charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies
3 because the court finds that the defendant is incompetent with no substantial
4 probability of attaining competence in the foreseeable future, the prosecuting
5 attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
6 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the Division of
7 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
8 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the
9 prosecuting attorney to file such a motion only if the person was previously ordered
10 to receive treatment to competency in an attempt to cause the person to attain
11 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment for a felony
12 charge that was dismissed. Section 1.5 also requires the prosecuting attorney to
13 serve the motion upon the Division.
14 Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to
15 determine whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to
16 request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates
17 whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic facility.
18 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 instead requires the prosecuting attorney to include a
19 request for an order directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk
20 assessment in the motion for a hearing. Section 1.5 also: (1) requires the court to
21 hold a hearing to determine whether to issue such an order; and (2) provides that if
22 the court determines such an order should be issued, the court must file the order
-
*AB550_R1*

– 2 –
23 not later than 5 judicial days after the date of the hearing. Section 1 of this bill
24 makes a conforming change to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by
25 section 1.5.
26 Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of
27 the Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional
28 release. If a person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1)
29 periodically review the eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional
30 release; and (2) discharge the person from conditional release if, upon review, the
31 court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person no longer poses a
32 danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2 of this bill provides
33 that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the State and any of its
34 agents or employees are not liable for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or
35 medical expenses incurred by the person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions
36 of the person.

6 and the defense counsel may examine the members of the treatment
7 team on their report.
8 2. If the judge orders the appointment of a licensed psychiatrist
9 or psychologist who is not employed by the Division to perform an
10 additional evaluation and report concerning the defendant, the cost
11 of the additional evaluation and report is a charge against the
12 county.
13 3. Within 10 days after the hearing or 10 days after the report is
14 sent, if no hearing is requested, the judge shall make and enter a
15 finding of competence or incompetence, and if the judge finds the

43 178.461 1. If the proceedings against a defendant who is
44 charged with any category A felony or a category B felony listed in
45 subsection [6] 7 are dismissed pursuant to subsection 5 of
-
*AB550_R1*

1 NRS 178.425, and the defendant was previously ordered, pursuant
2 to NRS 178.425, to receive treatment to competency in an attempt
3 to cause the defendant to attain competency to stand trial or

5 that was dismissed, the prosecuting attorney may, within 10 judicial
6 days after the dismissal, file a motion with the court for a hearing to
7 determine whether to commit the person to the custody of the
