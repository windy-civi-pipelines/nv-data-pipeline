EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions
governing the commitment and release of incompetent
criminal defendants; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a
2 defendant who is charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies
3 because the court finds that the defendant is incompetent with no substantial
4 probability of attaining competence in the foreseeable future, the prosecuting
5 attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
6 whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the Division of
7 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
8 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the
9 prosecuting attorney to file such a motion only if the person was previously ordered
10 to receive treatment to competency in an attempt to cause the person to attain
11 competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment for a felony
12 charge that was dismissed. Section 1.5 also requires the prosecuting attorney to
13 serve the motion upon the Division.
14 Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to
15 determine whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to
16 request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates
17 whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic facility.
18 (NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 instead requires the prosecuting attorney to include a
19 request for an order directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk
20 assessment in the motion for a hearing. Section 1.5 also requires the court to issue
21 an order directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk assessment not
22 later than 5 judicial days after the date on which the motion is filed.

23 Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of
24 the Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional
25 release. If a person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1)
26 periodically review the eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional
27 release; and (2) discharge the person from conditional release if, upon review, the
28 court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person no longer poses a
29 danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2 of this bill provides
30 that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the State and any of its
31 agents or employees are not liable for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or
32 medical expenses incurred by the person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions
33 of the person.

7 NRS 178.425, to receive treatment to competency in an attempt to
8 cause the defendant to attain competency to stand trial or receive
9 pronouncement of judgment for any such felony charge that was
10 dismissed, the prosecuting attorney may, within 10 judicial days
