Assembly Bill No. 550–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions
governing the commitment and release of incompetent
criminal defendants; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a
defendant who is charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies
because the court finds that the defendant is incompetent with no substantial
probability of attaining competence in the foreseeable future, the prosecuting
attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a hearing to determine
whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the Division of
Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
(NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the
prosecuting attorney to file such a motion only if the person was previously ordered
to receive treatment to competency in an attempt to cause the person to attain
competency to stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment for a felony
charge that was dismissed. Section 1.5 also requires the prosecuting attorney to
serve the motion upon the Division.
Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to
determine whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to
request from the Division a comprehensive risk assessment which indicates
whether the person requires the level of security provided by a forensic facility.
(NRS 178.461) Section 1.5 instead requires the prosecuting attorney to include a
request for an order directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk
assessment in the motion for a hearing. Section 1.5 also requires the court to issue
an order directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk assessment not
later than 5 judicial days after the date on which the motion is filed.
Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of
the Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional
release. If a person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1)
periodically review the eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional
release; and (2) discharge the person from conditional release if, upon review, the
court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person no longer poses a
danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2 of this bill provides
that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the State and any of its
agents or employees are not liable for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or
medical expenses incurred by the person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions
of the person.
