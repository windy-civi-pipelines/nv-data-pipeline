FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions governing the
commitment and release of incompetent criminal defendants; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a court dismisses the proceedings against a defendant who is
2 charged with any category A felony or certain category B felonies because the court finds that
3 the defendant is incompetent with no substantial probability of attaining competence in the
4 foreseeable future, the prosecuting attorney is authorized to file a motion with the court for a
5 hearing to determine whether to commit the person to the custody of the Administrator of the
6 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services.
7 (NRS 178.461) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill limits this authority by allowing the prosecuting
8 attorney to file such a motion only if the person [received] was previously ordered to receive
9 treatment to competency [.] in an attempt to cause the person to attain competency to
10 stand trial or receive pronouncement of judgment for a felony charge that was
11 dismissed. Section [1] 1.5 also requires the prosecuting attorney to [notify the court and]
12 serve the motion upon the Division . [, within a prescribed period, of his or her intent to seek
13 an order committing the person to the custody of the Administrator.]
14 Existing law requires a prosecuting attorney who files a motion for a hearing to determine
15 whether to commit a person to the custody of the Administrator to request from the Division a
16 comprehensive risk assessment which indicates whether the person requires the level of
17 security provided by a forensic facility. (NRS 178.461) Section [1] 1.5 instead requires the
18 prosecuting attorney to [petition the court] include a request for an order [requiring]
19 directing the Division to complete a comprehensive risk assessment [.] in the motion for a
20 hearing. Section [1] 1.5 also [provides that if the comprehensive risk assessment indicates
21 that the person assessed does not require the level of security provided by a forensic facility,
22 there is a rebuttable presumption] : (1) requires the court to hold a hearing to determine
23 whether to issue such an order; and (2) provides that if the [person does not require
24 placement at a forensic facility.] court determines such an order should be issued, the
25 court must file the order not later than 5 judicial days after the date of the hearing.
26 Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to provisions that have been
27 renumbered by section 1.5.
Assembly Amendment No. 750 to Assembly Bill No. 550 Page 4
28 Existing law authorizes the Division or a person committed to the custody of the
29 Administrator of the Division to petition the committing court for conditional release. If a
30 person is granted conditional release, the court is required to: (1) periodically review the
31 eligibility of the person for discharge from conditional release; and (2) discharge the person
32 from conditional release if, upon review, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
33 the person no longer poses a danger to himself or herself or others. (NRS 178.463) Section 2
34 of this bill provides that when a person is discharged from conditional release, the [facility
35 from which the person is discharged] State and any of its agents or employees [of the facility]
36 are not liable for: (1) any debts, contractual obligations or medical expenses incurred by the
37 person; or (2) any damages caused by the actions of the person.
