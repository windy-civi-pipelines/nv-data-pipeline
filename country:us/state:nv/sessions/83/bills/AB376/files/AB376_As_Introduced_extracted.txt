AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish and administer the Regulatory
Experimentation Program for Insurance Product
Innovation; setting forth requirements for the operation of
the Program; authorizing an insurer to implement a
proposed increase in a rate for certain kinds and lines of
insurance while the proposal is pending approval or
disapproval by the Commissioner; setting forth certain
requirements applicable in the event that such a proposal
is ultimately disapproved; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in
2 this State and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS
3 679B.120) Section 9 of this bill requires the Commissioner to establish and
4 administer the Regulatory Experimentation Program for Insurance Product
5 Innovation, which is a 4-year program to enable an authorized insurer who offers at
6 least one insurance product in this State outside of the Program to test a qualified
7 insurance product in this State without obtaining any authorization or complying
8 with any of the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code or the regulations adopted
9 pursuant thereto that would otherwise be required outside of the Program. Section 7
10 of this bill defines “qualified insurance product” to mean an insurance product that
11 provides coverage for real property located in this State that is valued at $250,000
12 or more.
13 Section 12 of this bill sets forth the process by which an authorized insurer may
14 apply to participate in the Program. Section 13 of this bill requires the
15 Commissioner to approve or deny an application within 90 days after the completed
16 application is received. Section 14 of this bill requires the Commissioner to provide
-
*AB376*
– 2 –
17 written notice of the approval or denial of an application and authorizes an
18 applicant to appeal a denial of an application to the Director of the Department of
19 Business and Industry. Under section 15 of this bill, if an application is approved,
20 the qualified insurance product offered or provided through the Program, with
21 certain exceptions, is exempt from the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code
22 and any regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
23 Section 10 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations
24 establishing protections for consumers of qualified insurance products provided
25 through the Program and authorizes the Commissioner to adopt any other
26 regulations to carry out the Program.
27 Section 11 of this bill requires certain disclosures to be provided before
28 providing a consumer a qualified insurance product through the Program.
29 Section 16 of this bill sets forth certain requirements relating to the retention of
30 records and reporting by a participant in the Program. Sections 17 and 26 of this
31 bill set forth certain requirements concerning the confidentiality and disclosure of
32 records relating to the Program.
33 Section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to submit a report to the
34 Legislature concerning the Program on or before January 1, 2029.
35 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to take certain
36 actions against a participant in the Program who commits certain violations or
37 engages in any act or omission that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent
38 with the health, safety or welfare of consumers or the public generally.
39 Sections 3-8 of this bill define certain words and terms relating to the Program.
40 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, insurers and certain rate service
41 organizations are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and proposed
42 increases thereto, as well as the forms of policies to which the rates apply,
43 supplementary rate information and any changes or amendments to the rates.
44 Existing law requires that such a filing be filed not less than 30 days before the
45 proposed effective date of the filing, with certain exceptions. (NRS 686B.070)
46 Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Commissioner is required to
47 approve or disapprove a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or line
48 of insurance, other than certain health plans. (NRS 686B.110) Sections 21-25 of
49 this bill revise those provisions to allow an insurer to implement a proposed
50 increase or decrease in certain rates while the process for the approval or
51 disapproval proceeds.
52 Section 21 requires a filing for a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any
53 kind or line of insurance for which the filing of rates is required, other than certain
54 health plans, to be filed on or before the proposed effective date included in the
55 filing. Section 21 authorizes an insurer to implement such a proposed increase or
56 decrease while the proposal is pending approval or disapproval by the
57 Commissioner.
58 Section 23 provides that if the Commissioner disapproves such a proposed
59 increase or decrease and the insurer has implemented the proposed increase or
60 decrease, the Commissioner is required to issue a written order that includes,
61 among other things, the date on which the disapproved increased or decreased rate
62 must no longer be used for the issuance of new policies or contracts or the renewal
63 of existing policies or contracts. Under section 23, the order does not affect any
64 policy or contract made before the effective date of the order, except that the
65 Commissioner is authorized to require that the premiums be adjusted after the
66 effective date of the order for those policies or contracts in effect on the effective
67 date of the order.
68 Under existing law, if a filing for a proposed increase in a rate is not
69 accompanied by certain information, the Commissioner is authorized to inform the
70 insurer and the filing is deemed to be made when the information is furnished.
71 (NRS 686B.100) Section 22 deems a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for any
-
*AB376*
– 3 –
72 kind or line of insurance, other than certain health plans, for the purpose of
73 implementing the proposed increase pending the approval or disapproval of the
74 Commissioner to be filed on the date on which it is filed with the Commissioner,
75 regardless of whether the filing is accompanied by such information. Similarly,
76 existing law provides that if the Commissioner determines that a proposal to
77 increase or decrease a rate is incomplete, the Commissioner must notify the insurer
78 or rate service organization of that determination and, if the insurer does not
79 provide the necessary documents or other information within 30 days after the
80 receipt of that notice, the Commissioner is authorized to disapprove the proposal.
81 (NRS 686B.110) Section 23 provides that a determination that a proposal to
82 increase or decrease a rate for any kind or line of insurance, other than certain
83 health plans, is incomplete does not prohibit an insurer from implementing the
84 proposed increase or decrease pending approval or disapproval.
85 Sections 24 and 25 make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have
86 been renumbered by section 21.

19 and must be filed not less than 30 days before that proposed
20 effective date, except that a filing for a proposed increase or
21 decrease in a rate for a health plan described in NRS 686B.112
22 may include a request that the Commissioner authorize an effective
23 date that is earlier than the proposed effective date.
24 3. A filing made pursuant to this section for a proposed
25 increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or line of insurance or
26 subdivision thereof, other than a health plan described in NRS
27 686B.112, must be filed on or before the proposed effective date
28 included in the filing. An insurer may implement the proposed
29 increase or decrease on the proposed effective date included in the
30 filing while the proposed increase or decrease is pending approval
31 or disapproval by the Commissioner pursuant to NRS 686B.110.
32 4. If an insurer makes a filing for a proposed increase in a rate
33 for insurance covering the liability of a practitioner licensed
34 pursuant to chapter 630, 631, 632 or 633 of NRS for a breach of the
35 practitioner’s professional duty toward a patient, the insurer shall

43 activities of a director, officer or employee of the insurer.

-
*AB376*
– 10 –

2 that the proposed increase relies upon such a component.

24 employed in setting the rates; and

26 2. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in this
27 subsection, whenever a filing of a proposed increase in a rate is not
28 accompanied by such information as the Commissioner has required
29 under subsection 1, the Commissioner may so inform the insurer
30 and the filing shall be deemed to be made when the information is
31 furnished. For the purposes of implementing a proposed increase
32 in a rate for any kind or line of insurance or subdivision thereof,
33 other than a health plan described in NRS 686B.112, pursuant to
34 subsection 3 of NRS 686B.070, the filing of such a proposed
35 increase shall be deemed to be made on the date on which it is
36 filed with the Commissioner, regardless of whether the filing is
37 accompanied by any information required by the Commissioner
38 pursuant to subsection 1.
39 Sec. 23. NRS 686B.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
40 686B.110 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 686B.112,
41 the Commissioner shall consider each proposed increase or decrease
42 in the rate of any kind or line of insurance or subdivision thereof
43 filed with the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS

45 result in a rate which is not in compliance with NRS 686B.050 or
-
*AB376*
– 11 –
1 subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner shall
2 disapprove the proposal. The Commissioner shall approve or
3 disapprove each proposal no later than 30 days after it is determined
4 by the Commissioner to be complete pursuant to subsection 6. If the
5 Commissioner fails to approve or disapprove the proposal within
6 that period, the proposal shall be deemed approved.
7 2. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed increase or
8 decrease in any rate pursuant to subsection 1, the Commissioner
9 shall send a written notice of disapproval to the insurer or the rate
10 service organization that filed the proposal. The notice must set
11 forth the reasons the proposal is not in compliance with NRS
12 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070 and must be sent to
13 the insurer or the rate service organization not more than 30 days
14 after the Commissioner determines that the proposal is complete
15 pursuant to subsection 6.
16 3. Upon receipt of a written notice of disapproval from the
17 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 2 or 6, the insurer or rate
18 service organization may request that the Commissioner reconsider
19 the proposed increase or decrease. The request for reconsideration
20 must be received by the Commissioner not more than 30 days after
21 the insurer or rate service organization receives the written notice of
22 disapproval from the Commissioner, except that if the insurer or rate
23 service organization requests, in writing, an extension of 30
24 additional days in which to request a reconsideration, the
25 Commissioner shall grant the extension. A request for
26 reconsideration submitted pursuant to this subsection may include,
27 without limitation, any documents or other information for review
28 by the Commissioner in reconsidering the proposal. The
29 Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the proposal upon
30 reconsideration not later than 30 days after receipt of the request for
31 reconsideration and shall notify the insurer or rate service
32 organization of his or her approval or disapproval.
33 4. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result
34 of the Commissioner’s disapproval of rates or other act, the
35 Commissioner shall on request specify interim rates for the insurer
36 that are high enough to protect the interests of all parties and may
37 order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an
38 escrow account approved by the Commissioner. When new rates
39 become legally effective, the Commissioner shall order the
40 escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be
41 distributed appropriately, except that refunds to policyholders that
42 are de minimis must not be required.
43 5. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed rate pursuant to
44 subsection 1 or subsection 6 or upon reconsideration pursuant to
45 subsection 3 and an insurer requests a hearing to determine the
-

– 12 –
1 validity of the action of the Commissioner, the insurer has the
2 burden of showing compliance with the applicable standards for
3 rates established in NRS 686B.010 to 686B.1799, inclusive. Any
4 such hearing must be held:
5 (a) Within 30 days after the request for a hearing has been
6 submitted to the Commissioner; or
7 (b) Within a period agreed upon by the insurer and the
8 Commissioner.
9  If the hearing is not held within the period specified in paragraph
10 (a) or (b), or if the Commissioner fails to issue an order concerning
11 the proposed rate for which the hearing is held within 45 days after
12 the hearing, the proposed rate shall be deemed approved.
13 6. The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the
14 documents or any other information which must be included in a
15 proposal to increase or decrease a rate submitted to the
16 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1. Each such proposal shall be
17 deemed complete upon its filing with the Commissioner, unless the
18 Commissioner, within 15 business days after the proposal is filed
19 with the Commissioner, determines that the proposal is incomplete
20 because the proposal does not comply with the regulations adopted
21 by the Commissioner pursuant to this subsection. The
22 determination of the Commissioner that a proposal is incomplete
23 does not prohibit an insurer from implementing a proposed
24 increase or decrease in a rate pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS
25 686B.070. The Commissioner shall notify the insurer or rate service
26 organization if the Commissioner determines that the proposal is
27 incomplete. The notice must be sent within 15 business days after
28 the proposal is filed with the Commissioner and must set forth the
29 documents or other information that is required to complete the
30 proposal. The Commissioner may disapprove the proposal if
31 the insurer or rate service organization fails to provide the
32 documents or other information to the Commissioner within 30 days
33 after the insurer or rate service organization receives the notice that
34 the proposal is incomplete. If the Commissioner disapproves the
35 proposal pursuant to this subsection, the Commissioner shall notify
36 the insurer or rate service organization of that fact in writing.
37 7. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed increase or
38 decrease in a rate pursuant to subsection 1 or 6, upon
39 reconsideration pursuant to subsection 3 or after a hearing
40 conducted pursuant to subsection 5 and the insurer has
41 implemented the proposed increase or decrease pending approval
42 or disapproval by the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 3 of
43 NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner shall issue a written order that
44 includes, without limitation, the specific reasons for the
45 disapproval, with citations to relevant statutes, and the date on
-
*AB376*
– 13 –
1 which the disapproved increased or decreased rate must no longer
2 be used for the issuance of new policies or contracts or the
3 renewal of existing policies or contracts. The date established by
4 the Commissioner must be not less than 90 days after the written
5 order is issued. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
6 the order does not affect any policy or contract made before the
7 effective date of the order. The Commissioner may require that the
8 premiums be adjusted after the effective date of the order for those
9 policies or contracts in effect on the effective date of the order.
10 Sec. 24. NRS 686B.112 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 686B.112 1. The Commissioner shall perform an actuarial
12 review of and consider each rate filing of a health plan issued
13 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 689A, 689B, 689C, 695B,
14 695C, 695D or 695F of NRS, including, without limitation, long-
15 term care and Medicare supplement plans, filed with the
16 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 686B.070. If the
17 Commissioner finds that a proposed rate which is contained in a rate
18 filing will result in a rate which is not in compliance with NRS
19 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner
20 shall disapprove the rate filing. The Commissioner shall approve or
21 disapprove each rate filing not later than 60 days after the rate filing
22 is determined by the Commissioner to be complete pursuant to
23 subsection 4. If the Commissioner fails to approve or disapprove the
24 rate filing within that period, the rate filing shall be deemed
25 approved.
26 2. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result
27 of the Commissioner’s disapproval of rates or other act, the
28 Commissioner shall on request specify interim rates for the insurer
29 that are high enough to protect the interests of all parties and may
30 order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an
31 escrow account approved by the Commissioner. When new rates
32 become legally effective, the Commissioner shall order the
33 escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be
34 distributed appropriately, except that refunds to policyholders that
35 are de minimis must not be required.
36 3. If the Commissioner disapproves a rate filing pursuant to
37 subsection 1, and an insurer requests a hearing to determine the
38 validity of the action of the Commissioner, the insurer has the
39 burden of showing compliance with the applicable standards for
40 rates established in NRS 686B.010 to 686B.1799, inclusive. Any
41 such hearing must be held:
42 (a) Within 30 days after the request for a hearing has been
43 submitted to the Commissioner; or
44 (b) Within a period agreed upon by the insurer and the
45 Commissioner.
-
*AB376*
– 14 –
1  If the hearing is not held within the period specified in paragraph
2 (a) or (b), or if the Commissioner fails to issue an order concerning
3 the rate filing for which the hearing is held within 45 days after the
4 hearing, the rate filing shall be deemed approved.
5 4. The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the
6 documents or any other information which must be included in a
7 rate filing submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1.
8 Each such rate filing shall be deemed complete upon its filing with
9 the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner, within 15 business
10 days after the rate filing is filed with the Commissioner, determines
11 that the rate filing is incomplete because the rate filing does not
12 comply with the regulations adopted by the Commissioner pursuant
13 to this subsection.
14 5. The Commissioner may assess against an insurer the actual
15 cost for the external actuarial review of a rate filing submitted
16 pursuant to subsection 1.
17 Sec. 25. NRS 686B.117 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 686B.117 If a filing made with the Commissioner pursuant to
19 paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 686B.070 pertains to
20 insurance covering the liability of a practitioner licensed pursuant
21 to chapter 630, 631, 632 or 633 of NRS for a breach of the
22 practitioner’s professional duty toward a patient, any interested
23 person, and any association of persons or organization whose
24 members may be affected, may intervene as a matter of right in any
25 hearing or other proceeding conducted to determine whether the
26 applicable rate or proposed increase thereto:
27 1. Complies with the standards set forth in NRS 686B.050 and
28 subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070.
29 2. Should be approved or disapproved.
30 Sec. 26. NRS 239.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:

1 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
2 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
4 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

6 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
7 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

18 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
19 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or

25 information that is not otherwise confidential.
26 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
27 has legal custody or control of a public record:

30 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
31 medium.
32 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
33 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 376–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS O’NEILL,
GRAY, DICKMAN, DELONG; AND GALLANT
MARCH 10, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance.
(BDR 57-1009)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish and administer the Regulatory
Experimentation Program for Insurance Product
Innovation; setting forth requirements for the operation of
the Program; authorizing an insurer to implement a
proposed increase in a rate for certain kinds and lines of
insurance while the proposal is pending approval or
disapproval by the Commissioner; setting forth certain
requirements applicable in the event that such a proposal
is ultimately disapproved; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in
2 this State and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS
3 679B.120) Section 9 of this bill requires the Commissioner to establish and
4 administer the Regulatory Experimentation Program for Insurance Product
5 Innovation, which is a 4-year program to enable an authorized insurer who offers at
6 least one insurance product in this State outside of the Program to test a qualified
7 insurance product in this State without obtaining any authorization or complying
8 with any of the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code or the regulations adopted
9 pursuant thereto that would otherwise be required outside of the Program. Section 7
10 of this bill defines “qualified insurance product” to mean an insurance product that
11 provides coverage for real property located in this State that is valued at $250,000
12 or more.
13 Section 12 of this bill sets forth the process by which an authorized insurer may
14 apply to participate in the Program. Section 13 of this bill requires the
15 Commissioner to approve or deny an application within 90 days after the completed
16 application is received. Section 14 of this bill requires the Commissioner to provide
-
*AB376*

– 2 –
17 written notice of the approval or denial of an application and authorizes an
18 applicant to appeal a denial of an application to the Director of the Department of
19 Business and Industry. Under section 15 of this bill, if an application is approved,
20 the qualified insurance product offered or provided through the Program, with
21 certain exceptions, is exempt from the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code
22 and any regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
23 Section 10 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations
24 establishing protections for consumers of qualified insurance products provided
25 through the Program and authorizes the Commissioner to adopt any other
26 regulations to carry out the Program.
27 Section 11 of this bill requires certain disclosures to be provided before
28 providing a consumer a qualified insurance product through the Program.
29 Section 16 of this bill sets forth certain requirements relating to the retention of
30 records and reporting by a participant in the Program. Sections 17 and 26 of this
31 bill set forth certain requirements concerning the confidentiality and disclosure of
32 records relating to the Program.
33 Section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to submit a report to the
34 Legislature concerning the Program on or before January 1, 2029.
35 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to take certain
36 actions against a participant in the Program who commits certain violations or
37 engages in any act or omission that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent
38 with the health, safety or welfare of consumers or the public generally.
39 Sections 3-8 of this bill define certain words and terms relating to the Program.
40 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, insurers and certain rate service
41 organizations are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and proposed
42 increases thereto, as well as the forms of policies to which the rates apply,
43 supplementary rate information and any changes or amendments to the rates.
44 Existing law requires that such a filing be filed not less than 30 days before the
45 proposed effective date of the filing, with certain exceptions. (NRS 686B.070)
46 Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Commissioner is required to
47 approve or disapprove a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or line
48 of insurance, other than certain health plans. (NRS 686B.110) Sections 21-25 of
49 this bill revise those provisions to allow an insurer to implement a proposed
50 increase or decrease in certain rates while the process for the approval or
51 disapproval proceeds.
52 Section 21 requires a filing for a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any
53 kind or line of insurance for which the filing of rates is required, other than certain
54 health plans, to be filed on or before the proposed effective date included in the
55 filing. Section 21 authorizes an insurer to implement such a proposed increase or
56 decrease while the proposal is pending approval or disapproval by the
57 Commissioner.
58 Section 23 provides that if the Commissioner disapproves such a proposed
59 increase or decrease and the insurer has implemented the proposed increase or
60 decrease, the Commissioner is required to issue a written order that includes,
61 among other things, the date on which the disapproved increased or decreased rate
62 must no longer be used for the issuance of new policies or contracts or the renewal
63 of existing policies or contracts. Under section 23, the order does not affect any
64 policy or contract made before the effective date of the order, except that the
65 Commissioner is authorized to require that the premiums be adjusted after the
66 effective date of the order for those policies or contracts in effect on the effective
67 date of the order.
68 Under existing law, if a filing for a proposed increase in a rate is not
69 accompanied by certain information, the Commissioner is authorized to inform the
70 insurer and the filing is deemed to be made when the information is furnished.
71 (NRS 686B.100) Section 22 deems a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for any
-
*AB376*

– 3 –
72 kind or line of insurance, other than certain health plans, for the purpose of
73 implementing the proposed increase pending the approval or disapproval of the
74 Commissioner to be filed on the date on which it is filed with the Commissioner,
75 regardless of whether the filing is accompanied by such information. Similarly,
76 existing law provides that if the Commissioner determines that a proposal to
77 increase or decrease a rate is incomplete, the Commissioner must notify the insurer
78 or rate service organization of that determination and, if the insurer does not
79 provide the necessary documents or other information within 30 days after the
80 receipt of that notice, the Commissioner is authorized to disapprove the proposal.
81 (NRS 686B.110) Section 23 provides that a determination that a proposal to
82 increase or decrease a rate for any kind or line of insurance, other than certain
83 health plans, is incomplete does not prohibit an insurer from implementing the
84 proposed increase or decrease pending approval or disapproval.
85 Sections 24 and 25 make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have
86 been renumbered by section 21.

17 2. [A] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a filing
18 made pursuant to this section must include a proposed effective date
19 and must be filed not less than 30 days before that proposed
20 effective date, except that a filing for a proposed increase or
21 decrease in a rate for a health plan described in NRS 686B.112
22 may include a request that the Commissioner authorize an effective
23 date that is earlier than the proposed effective date.
24 3. A filing made pursuant to this section for a proposed
25 increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or line of insurance or
26 subdivision thereof, other than a health plan described in NRS
27 686B.112, must be filed on or before the proposed effective date
28 included in the filing. An insurer may implement the proposed
29 increase or decrease on the proposed effective date included in the
30 filing while the proposed increase or decrease is pending approval
31 or disapproval by the Commissioner pursuant to NRS 686B.110.
32 4. If an insurer makes a filing for a proposed increase in a rate
33 for insurance covering the liability of a practitioner licensed
34 pursuant to chapter 630, 631, 632 or 633 of NRS for a breach of the
35 practitioner’s professional duty toward a patient, the insurer shall
36 not include in the filing any component that is directly or indirectly
37 related to the following:

39 interest or other investment returns, or any other financial loss that
40 is materially outside of the claims experience of the professional
41 liability insurance industry, as determined by the Commissioner.
42 (b) Losses that are the result of any criminal or fraudulent
43 activities of a director, officer or employee of the insurer.
44  If the Commissioner determines that a filing includes any such
45 component, the Commissioner shall, pursuant to NRS 686B.110,
-
*AB376*

– 10 –
1 disapprove the proposed increase, in whole or in part, to the extent
2 that the proposed increase relies upon such a component.
3 [4.] 5. If an insurer makes a filing for a proposed increase in a
4 rate for a health benefit plan, as that term is defined in NRS
5 687B.470, the filing must include a unified rate review template, a
6 written description justifying the rate increase and any rate filing
7 documentation.

10 the rate increase” have the meanings ascribed in 45 C.F.R.
11 § 154.215.
12 Sec. 22. NRS 686B.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 686B.100 1. By rule, the Commissioner may require the
14 filing of supporting data as to any or all kinds or lines of insurance
15 or subdivisions thereof or classes of risks or combinations thereof as
16 the Commissioner deems necessary for the proper functioning of the
17 process for monitoring and regulating rates. The supporting data
18 must include:
19 (a) The experience and judgment of the filer, and, to the extent it
20 wishes or the Commissioner requires, of other insurers or rate
21 service organizations;
22 (b) Its interpretation of any statistical data relied upon;
23 (c) Descriptions of the actuarial and statistical methods
24 employed in setting the rates; and
25 (d) Any other relevant matters required by the Commissioner.
26 2. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in this
27 subsection, whenever a filing of a proposed increase in a rate is not
28 accompanied by such information as the Commissioner has required
29 under subsection 1, the Commissioner may so inform the insurer
30 and the filing shall be deemed to be made when the information is
31 furnished. For the purposes of implementing a proposed increase
32 in a rate for any kind or line of insurance or subdivision thereof,
33 other than a health plan described in NRS 686B.112, pursuant to
34 subsection 3 of NRS 686B.070, the filing of such a proposed
35 increase shall be deemed to be made on the date on which it is
36 filed with the Commissioner, regardless of whether the filing is
37 accompanied by any information required by the Commissioner
38 pursuant to subsection 1.
39 Sec. 23. NRS 686B.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
40 686B.110 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 686B.112,
41 the Commissioner shall consider each proposed increase or decrease
42 in the rate of any kind or line of insurance or subdivision thereof
43 filed with the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
44 686B.070. If the Commissioner finds that a proposed increase will
45 result in a rate which is not in compliance with NRS 686B.050 or
-
*AB376*

– 11 –
1 subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner shall
2 disapprove the proposal. The Commissioner shall approve or
3 disapprove each proposal no later than 30 days after it is determined
4 by the Commissioner to be complete pursuant to subsection 6. If the
5 Commissioner fails to approve or disapprove the proposal within
6 that period, the proposal shall be deemed approved.
7 2. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed increase or
8 decrease in any rate pursuant to subsection 1, the Commissioner
9 shall send a written notice of disapproval to the insurer or the rate
10 service organization that filed the proposal. The notice must set
11 forth the reasons the proposal is not in compliance with NRS
12 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070 and must be sent to
13 the insurer or the rate service organization not more than 30 days
14 after the Commissioner determines that the proposal is complete
15 pursuant to subsection 6.
16 3. Upon receipt of a written notice of disapproval from the
17 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 2 or 6, the insurer or rate
18 service organization may request that the Commissioner reconsider
19 the proposed increase or decrease. The request for reconsideration
20 must be received by the Commissioner not more than 30 days after
21 the insurer or rate service organization receives the written notice of
22 disapproval from the Commissioner, except that if the insurer or rate
23 service organization requests, in writing, an extension of 30
24 additional days in which to request a reconsideration, the
25 Commissioner shall grant the extension. A request for
26 reconsideration submitted pursuant to this subsection may include,
27 without limitation, any documents or other information for review
28 by the Commissioner in reconsidering the proposal. The
29 Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the proposal upon
30 reconsideration not later than 30 days after receipt of the request for
31 reconsideration and shall notify the insurer or rate service
32 organization of his or her approval or disapproval.
33 4. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result
34 of the Commissioner’s disapproval of rates or other act, the
35 Commissioner shall on request specify interim rates for the insurer
36 that are high enough to protect the interests of all parties and may
37 order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an
38 escrow account approved by the Commissioner. When new rates
39 become legally effective, the Commissioner shall order the
40 escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be
41 distributed appropriately, except that refunds to policyholders that
42 are de minimis must not be required.
43 5. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed rate pursuant to
44 subsection 1 or subsection 6 or upon reconsideration pursuant to
45 subsection 3 and an insurer requests a hearing to determine the
-
*AB376*

– 12 –
1 validity of the action of the Commissioner, the insurer has the
2 burden of showing compliance with the applicable standards for
3 rates established in NRS 686B.010 to 686B.1799, inclusive. Any
4 such hearing must be held:
5 (a) Within 30 days after the request for a hearing has been
6 submitted to the Commissioner; or
7 (b) Within a period agreed upon by the insurer and the
8 Commissioner.
9  If the hearing is not held within the period specified in paragraph
10 (a) or (b), or if the Commissioner fails to issue an order concerning
11 the proposed rate for which the hearing is held within 45 days after
12 the hearing, the proposed rate shall be deemed approved.
13 6. The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the
14 documents or any other information which must be included in a
15 proposal to increase or decrease a rate submitted to the
16 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1. Each such proposal shall be
17 deemed complete upon its filing with the Commissioner, unless the
18 Commissioner, within 15 business days after the proposal is filed
19 with the Commissioner, determines that the proposal is incomplete
20 because the proposal does not comply with the regulations adopted
21 by the Commissioner pursuant to this subsection. The
22 determination of the Commissioner that a proposal is incomplete
23 does not prohibit an insurer from implementing a proposed
24 increase or decrease in a rate pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS
25 686B.070. The Commissioner shall notify the insurer or rate service
26 organization if the Commissioner determines that the proposal is
27 incomplete. The notice must be sent within 15 business days after
28 the proposal is filed with the Commissioner and must set forth the
29 documents or other information that is required to complete the
30 proposal. The Commissioner may disapprove the proposal if
31 the insurer or rate service organization fails to provide the
32 documents or other information to the Commissioner within 30 days
33 after the insurer or rate service organization receives the notice that
34 the proposal is incomplete. If the Commissioner disapproves the
35 proposal pursuant to this subsection, the Commissioner shall notify
36 the insurer or rate service organization of that fact in writing.
37 7. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed increase or
38 decrease in a rate pursuant to subsection 1 or 6, upon
39 reconsideration pursuant to subsection 3 or after a hearing
40 conducted pursuant to subsection 5 and the insurer has
41 implemented the proposed increase or decrease pending approval
42 or disapproval by the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 3 of
43 NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner shall issue a written order that
44 includes, without limitation, the specific reasons for the
45 disapproval, with citations to relevant statutes, and the date on
-
*AB376*

– 13 –
1 which the disapproved increased or decreased rate must no longer
2 be used for the issuance of new policies or contracts or the
3 renewal of existing policies or contracts. The date established by
4 the Commissioner must be not less than 90 days after the written
5 order is issued. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
6 the order does not affect any policy or contract made before the
7 effective date of the order. The Commissioner may require that the
8 premiums be adjusted after the effective date of the order for those
9 policies or contracts in effect on the effective date of the order.
10 Sec. 24. NRS 686B.112 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 686B.112 1. The Commissioner shall perform an actuarial
12 review of and consider each rate filing of a health plan issued
13 pursuant to the provisions of chapter 689A, 689B, 689C, 695B,
14 695C, 695D or 695F of NRS, including, without limitation, long-
15 term care and Medicare supplement plans, filed with the
16 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 686B.070. If the
17 Commissioner finds that a proposed rate which is contained in a rate
18 filing will result in a rate which is not in compliance with NRS
19 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner
20 shall disapprove the rate filing. The Commissioner shall approve or
21 disapprove each rate filing not later than 60 days after the rate filing
22 is determined by the Commissioner to be complete pursuant to
23 subsection 4. If the Commissioner fails to approve or disapprove the
24 rate filing within that period, the rate filing shall be deemed
25 approved.
26 2. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result
27 of the Commissioner’s disapproval of rates or other act, the
28 Commissioner shall on request specify interim rates for the insurer
29 that are high enough to protect the interests of all parties and may
30 order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an
31 escrow account approved by the Commissioner. When new rates
32 become legally effective, the Commissioner shall order the
33 escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be
34 distributed appropriately, except that refunds to policyholders that
35 are de minimis must not be required.
36 3. If the Commissioner disapproves a rate filing pursuant to
37 subsection 1, and an insurer requests a hearing to determine the
38 validity of the action of the Commissioner, the insurer has the
39 burden of showing compliance with the applicable standards for
40 rates established in NRS 686B.010 to 686B.1799, inclusive. Any
41 such hearing must be held:
42 (a) Within 30 days after the request for a hearing has been
43 submitted to the Commissioner; or
44 (b) Within a period agreed upon by the insurer and the
45 Commissioner.

1  If the hearing is not held within the period specified in paragraph
2 (a) or (b), or if the Commissioner fails to issue an order concerning
3 the rate filing for which the hearing is held within 45 days after the
4 hearing, the rate filing shall be deemed approved.
5 4. The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the
6 documents or any other information which must be included in a
7 rate filing submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1.
8 Each such rate filing shall be deemed complete upon its filing with
9 the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner, within 15 business
10 days after the rate filing is filed with the Commissioner, determines
11 that the rate filing is incomplete because the rate filing does not
12 comply with the regulations adopted by the Commissioner pursuant
13 to this subsection.
14 5. The Commissioner may assess against an insurer the actual
15 cost for the external actuarial review of a rate filing submitted
16 pursuant to subsection 1.
17 Sec. 25. NRS 686B.117 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 686B.117 If a filing made with the Commissioner pursuant to
19 paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 686B.070 pertains to
20 insurance covering the liability of a practitioner licensed pursuant
21 to chapter 630, 631, 632 or 633 of NRS for a breach of the
22 practitioner’s professional duty toward a patient, any interested
23 person, and any association of persons or organization whose
24 members may be affected, may intervene as a matter of right in any
25 hearing or other proceeding conducted to determine whether the
26 applicable rate or proposed increase thereto:

28 subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070.

1 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
2 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
4 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
5 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
6 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
7 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
8 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
9 electronically, the confidential information from the information
10 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
11 confidential.

13 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
14 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity

18 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
19 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
20 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

24 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
25 information that is not otherwise confidential.
26 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
27 has legal custody or control of a public record:

30 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
31 medium.
32 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
33 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
