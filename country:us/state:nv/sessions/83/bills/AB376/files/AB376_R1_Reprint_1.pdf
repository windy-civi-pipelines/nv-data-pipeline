Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in
2 this State and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS
3 679B.120) Section 9 of this bill requires the Commissioner to establish and
4 administer the Regulatory Experimentation Program for Insurance Product
5 Innovation, which is a 4-year program to enable an authorized insurer who offers at
6 least one insurance product that provides property insurance coverage for real or
7 personal property located in this State outside of the Program to test a qualified
8 insurance product in this State without complying with certain provisions of the
9 Nevada Insurance Code or certain regulations adopted pursuant thereto that would
10 otherwise be required outside of the Program. Section 7 of this bill defines
11 “qualified insurance product” to mean an insurance product that provides property
12 insurance coverage for real or personal property located in this State.

– 2 –
13 Section 12 of this bill sets forth the process by which an authorized insurer may
14 apply to participate in the Program. Section 12 requires the application of the
15 applicant to include, among other information, an explanation of any exemption
16 from the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code or the regulations adopted
17 pursuant thereto that the applicant is requesting. Section 13 of this bill requires the
18 Commissioner to approve or deny an application within 90 days after the completed
19 application is received. Section 14 of this bill requires the Commissioner to provide
20 written notice of the approval or denial of an application. Under section 15 of this
21 bill, if an application is approved, the qualified insurance product offered or
22 provided through the Program, with certain exceptions, is exempt from the
23 provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code and the regulations adopted pursuant
24 thereto for which an exemption was requested in the application to participate in the
25 Program. Section 15 also limits the period of testing for a qualified insurance
26 product under the Program to 36 months, with one extension of not more than 12
27 months if approved by the Commissioner.
28 Section 10 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations to carry
29 out the Program.
30 Section 11 of this bill requires certain disclosures to be provided before
31 providing a consumer a qualified insurance product through the Program.
32 Section 16 of this bill sets forth certain requirements relating to the retention of
33 records and reporting by a participant in the Program. Sections 17 and 26 of this
34 bill set forth certain requirements concerning the confidentiality and disclosure of
35 records relating to the Program.
36 Section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to submit a report to the
37 Legislature concerning the Program on or before January 1, 2029.
38 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to take certain
39 actions against a participant in the Program who commits certain violations or
40 engages in any act or omission that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent
41 with the health, safety or welfare of consumers or the public generally.
42 Sections 3-8 of this bill define certain words and terms relating to the Program.
43 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, insurers and certain rate service
44 organizations are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and proposed
45 increases thereto, as well as the forms of policies to which the rates apply,
46 supplementary rate information and any changes or amendments to the rates.
47 Existing law requires that such a filing be filed not less than 30 days before the
48 proposed effective date of the filing, with certain exceptions. (NRS 686B.070)
49 Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Commissioner is required to
50 approve or disapprove a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or line
51 of insurance, other than certain health plans. (NRS 686B.110)
52 Sections 20.3 and 21 of this bill provide an alternative method by which
53 certain insurers may make a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for certain types
54 of insurance. Section 20.3 requires the Commissioner to establish a program of
55 flex-rated filing to allow an insurer that issues certain lines of property insurance to
56 make a filing for that line of insurance if the proposed increase does not exceed
57 certain thresholds established by the Commissioner and certain other requirements
58 are met. Section 20.3 sets forth certain requirements for making a filing for a
59 proposed increase in a rate to qualify to be filed under the program of flex-rated
60 filing. If the Commissioner finds, within 15 days after the filing is made, that the
61 filing fails to meet such requirements, section 20.3 authorizes the Commissioner to
62 treat the filing in the same manner as other proposed increases in a rate filed outside
63 the program of flex-rated filing. If the Commissioner does not make such a
64 determination within that time, the filing is deemed to be approved. Section 20.5 of
65 this bill applies the definitions set forth under existing law governing rate filings to
66 the provisions of section 20.3. Section 20.7 of this bill excludes property insurance
67 for business and commercial risks from the provisions of section 20.3.

68 Section 25.1 of this bill authorizes an insurer that issues a policy of property
69 insurance to exclude the peril of wildfire from the coverage provided under the
70 policy. Section 25.1 additionally authorizes an insurer to issue a policy of property
71 insurance that solely covers the peril of wildfire.
72 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions for the operation of
73 a reciprocal insurer. (Chapter 694B of NRS) Existing law sets forth certain rules
74 that the Commissioner is required to apply in determining the financial condition of
75 a reciprocal insurer, including rules concerning the computation of reserves. (NRS
76 694B.150) Section 25.3 of this bill revises those rules concerning reserves to
77 require instead that the reserves of a reciprocal insurer be maintained as required by
78 section 25.2 of this bill. Section 25.2 requires a reciprocal insurer at all times to
79 maintain an unearned premium reserve in a certain amount and sets forth the
80 manner in which that amount must be calculated. If, at any time, the amount of the
81 unearned premium reserve maintained by a reciprocal insurer is less than $100,000,
82 section 25.2 requires the reciprocal insurer to maintain cash or securities acceptable
83 to the Commissioner in an amount that, when added to the amount of the unearned
84 premium reserve maintained, equals not less than $100,000.
85 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of captive insurers.
86 (Chapter 694C of NRS) Section 25.5 of this bill removes provisions prohibiting a
87 captive insurer from directly providing homeowners’ insurance coverage. Section
88 25.5 authorizes an association captive insurer to insure the risks of individual
89 homeowners who combine into an association for the purpose of procuring
90 homeowners’ insurance or the risks of individual units’ owners in a common-
91 interest community so long as the association captive insurer is owned by the
92 association created by the homeowners or the unit-owners’ association, as
93 applicable. Sections 25.4 and 25.5 of this bill authorize a sponsored captive insurer
94 to insure the risks of individual homeowners who elect to become a participant of a
95 protected cell of a sponsored captive insurer.
96 Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association in a common-interest
97 community to maintain certain insurance coverage, including property insurance on
98 the common elements of the community. (NRS 116.3113) Section 25.6 of this bill
99 removes provisions which require such property insurance for buildings with units
100 divided by certain boundaries to include the units to the extent reasonably available.
101 Section 25.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to
102 provisions removed in section 25.6.

27 refer to any comments, conclusions or results of an examination,
28 inquiry or investigation in any communication to a consumer or

30 3. The Commissioner is immune from civil liability for any

15 Sec. 19. If the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe
16 that a participant has engaged in, is engaging in or threatens to
17 engage in any act or omission in violation of any provision of
18 sections 2 to 20, inclusive, of this act or any other applicable
19 statute or regulation for which a civil or criminal penalty is
20 prescribed, the Commissioner may remove the participant from
21 the Program or order the participant to exit the Program.
22 Sec. 20. If the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe
23 that a participant has engaged in, is engaging in or threatens to
24 engage in any act or omission that the Commissioner determines
25 is inconsistent with the health, safety or welfare of consumers or
26 the public generally, the Commissioner may:

29 2. Require the participant to comply with one or more
30 provisions of this title or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto;

34 Sec. 20.3. Chapter 686B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
35 thereto a new section to read as follows:
36 1. The Commissioner shall establish a program of flex-rated
37 filing to allow an insurer that issues a line of property insurance
38 that provides coverage for real property to make a filing for a
39 proposed increase in a rate for that line of insurance under the
40 program, in lieu of making a filing pursuant to NRS 686B.070, if
41 the proposed increase does not exceed either of the flex-rated
42 filing thresholds established by the Commissioner and all other
43 requirements of this section are met.
44 2. To qualify for filing under the program of flex-rated filing
45 established pursuant to this section:
-
*AB376_R1*

– 10 –
1 (a) The filing must be limited solely to a proposed increase in a
2 rate and must not contain changes to any supplementary rate
3 information;
4 (b) The proposed increase in the rate must not exceed either of
5 the flex-rated filing thresholds which are in effect at the time the
6 filing is made;
7 (c) The proposed increase must not take effect for any existing

10 (d) The date on which the first existing policyholder will be
11 affected by the proposed increase must be not earlier than 45 days
12 after the date on which the filing is made.
13 3. An insurer may not make a filing for a proposed increase
14 in a rate under the program of flex-rated filing established
15 pursuant to this section if:
16 (a) The cumulative effect of the filing and all other filings filed
17 by the insurer on the same line of insurance within the 12 months
18 immediately preceding the proposed effective date of the proposed
19 increase exceeds either of the flex-rated filing thresholds which
20 are in effect on the date the filing is made; and
21 (b) Any policyholder that will be affected by the proposed
22 increase has been affected by an increase filed under the program
23 of flex-rated filing within the 12 months immediately preceding
24 the proposed effective date of the proposed increase.
25 4. The Commissioner shall review each proposed increase in
26 a rate filed under the program of flex-rated filing established
27 pursuant to this section. If the Commissioner, within 15 days after
28 the date on which the filing is made, finds that a proposed
29 increase does not comply with the provisions of subsection 2 or 3
30 or subsection 1 of NRS 686B.050, the Commissioner shall provide
31 notice to the insurer and subsequently treat the filing as if it were
32 filed pursuant to NRS 686B.070. If the Commissioner has not
33 provided the notice to the insurer within 15 days after the date on
34 which the filing is made, the filing shall be deemed to be approved.
35 5. On or before June 1, 2026, the Commissioner shall
36 establish the maximum percentage of overall rate impact and the
37 maximum percentage of individual rate disruption for a filing for
38 a proposed increase in a rate to qualify for filing under the
39 program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this section.
40 Thereafter, on or before June 1 of any year, the Commissioner
41 may adjust the flex-rated filing thresholds to take effect on June 1
42 of that year. In establishing the initial and adjusted flex-rated
43 filing thresholds pursuant to this subsection, the Commissioner
44 shall:
-
*AB376_R1*

– 11 –
1 (a) Before establishing the flex-rated filing thresholds, solicit
2 public input and hold a public hearing on the matter to consider
3 past and future economic conditions; and
4 (b) Establish the maximum percentage of overall rate impact
5 to be a percentage that is not less than 3 percent.
6 6. For the purposes of this section, the filing of a proposed
7 increase in a rate under the program of flex-rated filing
8 established pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be made on
9 the date on which it is submitted to the Commissioner using the
10 System for Electronic Rates and Forms Filing developed and
11 implemented by the National Association of Insurance
12 Commissioners or any successor system.
13 7. The Commissioner may adopt regulations to carry out the
14 provisions of this section.
15 8. As used in this section:
16 (a) “Flex-rated filing threshold” means the maximum
17 percentage of:
18 (1) Overall rate impact; and
19 (2) Individual rate disruption,
20  that the Commissioner has established pursuant to subsection 5
21 for a filing for a proposed increase in a rate to qualify for filing
22 under the program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this
23 section.
24 (b) “Individual rate disruption” means the largest percentage
25 increase in the amount of the premiums of any single policyholder
26 affected by a filing for a proposed increase in a rate that will occur
27 if the proposed increase becomes effective.
28 (c) “Overall rate impact” means the amount, expressed as a
29 percentage, obtained by dividing the total aggregate amount by
30 which all premiums for all policyholders affected by a filing for a
31 proposed increase in a rate will be increased if the proposed
32 increase becomes effective by the total aggregate amount of all
33 premiums for those policyholders on the day immediately
34 preceding the proposed effective date of the proposed increase.

19 unit’s owner and each holder of a security interest to whom a
20 certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their
21 respective last known addresses.
