AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring the Commissioner of
Insurance to establish and administer the Regulatory
Experimentation Program for Insurance Product Innovation;
setting forth requirements for the operation of the Program;
authorizing certain property insurers to file a proposed
increase in a rate for certain lines of insurance through a

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in
this State and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS
679B.120) Section 9 of this bill requires the Commissioner to establish and
administer the Regulatory Experimentation Program for Insurance Product
Innovation, which is a 4-year program to enable an authorized insurer who offers at
least one insurance product that provides property insurance coverage for real or
personal property located in this State outside of the Program to test a qualified
insurance product in this State without complying with certain provisions of the
Nevada Insurance Code or certain regulations adopted pursuant thereto that would
otherwise be required outside of the Program. Section 7 of this bill defines
“qualified insurance product” to mean an insurance product that provides property
insurance coverage for real or personal property located in this State.
Section 12 of this bill sets forth the process by which an authorized insurer may
apply to participate in the Program. Section 12 requires the application of the
applicant to include, among other information, an explanation of any exemption
from the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code or the regulations adopted
pursuant thereto that the applicant is requesting. Section 13 of this bill requires the
Commissioner to approve or deny an application within 90 days after the completed
application is received. Section 14 of this bill requires the Commissioner to provide
written notice of the approval or denial of an application. Under section 15 of this
bill, if an application is approved, the qualified insurance product offered or
provided through the Program, with certain exceptions, is exempt from the
provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto for which an exemption was requested in the application to participate in the
Program. Section 15 also limits the period of testing for a qualified insurance
product under the Program to 36 months, with one extension of not more than 12
months if approved by the Commissioner.
Section 10 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations to carry
out the Program.

Section 11 of this bill requires certain disclosures to be provided before
providing a consumer a qualified insurance product through the Program.
Section 16 of this bill sets forth certain requirements relating to the retention of
records and reporting by a participant in the Program. Sections 17 and 26 of this
bill set forth certain requirements concerning the confidentiality and disclosure of
records relating to the Program.
Section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to submit a report to the
Legislature concerning the Program on or before January 1, 2029.
Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to take certain
actions against a participant in the Program who commits certain violations or
engages in any act or omission that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent
with the health, safety or welfare of consumers or the public generally.
Sections 3-8 of this bill define certain words and terms relating to the Program.
Under existing law, with certain exceptions, insurers and certain rate service
organizations are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and proposed
increases thereto, as well as the forms of policies to which the rates apply,
supplementary rate information and any changes or amendments to the rates.
Existing law requires that such a filing be filed not less than 30 days before the
proposed effective date of the filing, with certain exceptions. (NRS 686B.070)
Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Commissioner is required to
approve or disapprove a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or line
of insurance, other than certain health plans. (NRS 686B.110)
Sections 20.3 and 21 of this bill provide an alternative method by which
certain insurers may make a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for certain types
of insurance. Section 20.3 requires the Commissioner to establish a program of
flex-rated filing to allow an insurer that issues certain lines of property insurance to
make a filing for that line of insurance if the proposed increase does not exceed
certain thresholds established by the Commissioner and certain other requirements
are met. Section 20.3 sets forth certain requirements for making a filing for a
proposed increase in a rate to qualify to be filed under the program of flex-rated
filing. If the Commissioner finds, within 15 days after the filing is made, that the
filing fails to meet such requirements, section 20.3 authorizes the Commissioner to
treat the filing in the same manner as other proposed increases in a rate filed outside
the program of flex-rated filing. If the Commissioner does not make such a
determination within that time, the filing is deemed to be approved. Section 20.5 of
this bill applies the definitions set forth under existing law governing rate filings to
the provisions of section 20.3. Section 20.7 of this bill excludes property insurance
for business and commercial risks from the provisions of section 20.3.
Section 25.1 of this bill authorizes an insurer that issues a policy of property
insurance to exclude the peril of wildfire from the coverage provided under the
policy. Section 25.1 additionally authorizes an insurer to issue a policy of property
insurance that solely covers the peril of wildfire.
Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions for the operation of
a reciprocal insurer. (Chapter 694B of NRS) Existing law sets forth certain rules
that the Commissioner is required to apply in determining the financial condition of
a reciprocal insurer, including rules concerning the computation of reserves. (NRS
694B.150) Section 25.3 of this bill revises those rules concerning reserves to
require instead that the reserves of a reciprocal insurer be maintained as required by
section 25.2 of this bill. Section 25.2 requires a reciprocal insurer at all times to
maintain an unearned premium reserve in a certain amount and sets forth the
manner in which that amount must be calculated. If, at any time, the amount of the
unearned premium reserve maintained by a reciprocal insurer is less than $100,000,
section 25.2 requires the reciprocal insurer to maintain cash or securities acceptable
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
to the Commissioner in an amount that, when added to the amount of the unearned
premium reserve maintained, equals not less than $100,000.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of captive insurers.
(Chapter 694C of NRS) Section 25.5 of this bill removes provisions prohibiting a
captive insurer from directly providing homeowners’ insurance coverage. Section
25.5 authorizes an association captive insurer to insure the risks of individual
homeowners who combine into an association for the purpose of procuring
homeowners’ insurance or the risks of individual units’ owners in a common-
interest community so long as the association captive insurer is owned by the
association created by the homeowners or the unit-owners’ association, as
applicable. Sections 25.4 and 25.5 of this bill authorize a sponsored captive insurer
to insure the risks of individual homeowners who elect to become a participant of a
protected cell of a sponsored captive insurer.
Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association in a common-interest
community to maintain certain insurance coverage, including property insurance on
the common elements of the community. Existing law requires such property
insurance for buildings with units divided by certain boundaries to include the units
to the extent reasonably available. (NRS 116.3113) Section 25.6 of this bill
provides that the requirement concerning the inclusion of the units in the property
insurance coverage does not apply to property insurance maintained by an
association which covers the peril of wildfire and which coordinates with or
subrogates individual policies of property insurance maintained by the units’
owners that cover the peril of wildfire.

notice to the insurer and subsequently treat the filing as if it were
filed pursuant to NRS 686B.070. If the Commissioner has not
provided the notice to the insurer within 15 days after the date on
which the filing is made, the filing shall be deemed to be approved.
5. On or before June 1, 2026, the Commissioner shall

the date on which it is submitted to the Commissioner using the

for a filing for a proposed increase in a rate to qualify for filing
under the program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this
section.

premiums for those policyholders on the day immediately
preceding the proposed effective date of the proposed increase.

before that proposed effective date, except that a filing for a
proposed increase or decrease in a rate may include a request that
the Commissioner authorize an effective date that is earlier than the
proposed effective date.
3. If an insurer makes a filing for a proposed increase in a rate
for insurance covering the liability of a practitioner licensed
pursuant to chapter 630, 631, 632 or 633 of NRS for a breach of the

that the proposed increase relies upon such a component.

3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic

means of an electronic medium would:

(2) Require the production of information that is confidential
and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
