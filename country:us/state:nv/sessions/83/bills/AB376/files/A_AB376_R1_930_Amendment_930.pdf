Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in this State
2 and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS 679B.120) Section 9 of this
3 bill requires the Commissioner to establish and administer the Regulatory Experimentation
4 Program for Insurance Product Innovation, which is a 4-year program to enable an authorized
5 insurer who offers at least one insurance product that provides property insurance coverage
6 for real or personal property located in this State outside of the Program to test a qualified
7 insurance product in this State without complying with certain provisions of the Nevada
8 Insurance Code or certain regulations adopted pursuant thereto that would otherwise be
9 required outside of the Program. Section 7 of this bill defines “qualified insurance product” to
10 mean an insurance product that provides property insurance coverage for real or personal
11 property located in this State.
12 Section 12 of this bill sets forth the process by which an authorized insurer may apply to
13 participate in the Program. Section 12 requires the application of the applicant to include,
14 among other information, an explanation of any exemption from the provisions of the Nevada
15 Insurance Code or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto that the applicant is requesting.
16 Section 13 of this bill requires the Commissioner to approve or deny an application within 90
17 days after the completed application is received. Section 14 of this bill requires the

Senate Amendment No. 930 to Assembly Bill No. 376 First Reprint Page 4
18 Commissioner to provide written notice of the approval or denial of an application. Under
19 section 15 of this bill, if an application is approved, the qualified insurance product offered or
20 provided through the Program, with certain exceptions, is exempt from the provisions of the
21 Nevada Insurance Code and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto for which an exemption
22 was requested in the application to participate in the Program. Section 15 also limits the
23 period of testing for a qualified insurance product under the Program to 36 months, with one
24 extension of not more than 12 months if approved by the Commissioner.
25 Section 10 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations to carry out the
26 Program.
27 Section 11 of this bill requires certain disclosures to be provided before providing a
28 consumer a qualified insurance product through the Program.
29 Section 16 of this bill sets forth certain requirements relating to the retention of records
30 and reporting by a participant in the Program. Sections 17 and 26 of this bill set forth certain
31 requirements concerning the confidentiality and disclosure of records relating to the Program.
32 Section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to submit a report to the Legislature
33 concerning the Program on or before January 1, 2029.
34 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to take certain actions against
35 a participant in the Program who commits certain violations or engages in any act or omission
36 that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent with the health, safety or welfare of
37 consumers or the public generally.
38 Sections 3-8 of this bill define certain words and terms relating to the Program.
39 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, insurers and certain rate service
40 organizations are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and proposed increases
41 thereto, as well as the forms of policies to which the rates apply, supplementary rate
42 information and any changes or amendments to the rates. Existing law requires that such a
43 filing be filed not less than 30 days before the proposed effective date of the filing, with
44 certain exceptions. (NRS 686B.070) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the
45 Commissioner is required to approve or disapprove a proposed increase or decrease in a rate
46 for any kind or line of insurance, other than certain health plans. (NRS 686B.110)
47 Sections 20.3 and 21 of this bill provide an alternative method by which certain insurers
48 may make a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for certain types of insurance. Section 20.3
49 requires the Commissioner to establish a program of flex-rated filing to allow an insurer that
50 issues certain lines of property insurance to make a filing for that line of insurance if the
51 proposed increase does not exceed certain thresholds established by the Commissioner and
52 certain other requirements are met. Section 20.3 sets forth certain requirements for making a
53 filing for a proposed increase in a rate to qualify to be filed under the program of flex-rated
54 filing. If the Commissioner finds, within 15 days after the filing is made, that the filing fails to
55 meet such requirements, section 20.3 authorizes the Commissioner to treat the filing in the
56 same manner as other proposed increases in a rate filed outside the program of flex-rated
57 filing. If the Commissioner does not make such a determination within that time, the filing is
58 deemed to be approved. Section 20.5 of this bill applies the definitions set forth under existing
59 law governing rate filings to the provisions of section 20.3. Section 20.7 of this bill excludes
60 property insurance for business and commercial risks from the provisions of section 20.3.
61 Section 25.1 of this bill authorizes an insurer that issues a policy of property insurance to
62 exclude the peril of wildfire from the coverage provided under the policy. Section 25.1
63 additionally authorizes an insurer to issue a policy of property insurance that solely covers the
64 peril of wildfire.
65 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions for the operation of a
66 reciprocal insurer. (Chapter 694B of NRS) Existing law sets forth certain rules that the
67 Commissioner is required to apply in determining the financial condition of a reciprocal
68 insurer, including rules concerning the computation of reserves. (NRS 694B.150) Section
69 25.3 of this bill revises those rules concerning reserves to require instead that the reserves of a
70 reciprocal insurer be maintained as required by section 25.2 of this bill. Section 25.2 requires
71 a reciprocal insurer at all times to maintain an unearned premium reserve in a certain amount
72 and sets forth the manner in which that amount must be calculated. If, at any time, the amount
73 of the unearned premium reserve maintained by a reciprocal insurer is less than $100,000,
74 section 25.2 requires the reciprocal insurer to maintain cash or securities acceptable to the
75 Commissioner in an amount that, when added to the amount of the unearned premium reserve
76 maintained, equals not less than $100,000.

Senate Amendment No. 930 to Assembly Bill No. 376 First Reprint Page 5
77 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of captive insurers. (Chapter 694C
78 of NRS) Section 25.5 of this bill removes provisions prohibiting a captive insurer from
79 directly providing homeowners’ insurance coverage. Section 25.5 authorizes an association
80 captive insurer to insure the risks of individual homeowners who combine into an association
81 for the purpose of procuring homeowners’ insurance or the risks of individual units’ owners in
82 a common-interest community so long as the association captive insurer is owned by the
83 association created by the homeowners or the unit-owners’ association, as applicable.
84 Sections 25.4 and 25.5 of this bill authorize a sponsored captive insurer to insure the risks of
85 individual homeowners who elect to become a participant of a protected cell of a sponsored
86 captive insurer.
87 Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association in a common-interest community to
88 maintain certain insurance coverage, including property insurance on the common elements of
89 the community. [(NRS 116.3113) Section 25.6 of this bill removes provisions which require]
90 Existing law requires such property insurance for buildings with units divided by certain
91 boundaries to include the units to the extent reasonably available. (NRS 116.3113) Section
92 [25.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to provisions removed in
93 section] 25.6 [.] of this bill provides that the requirement concerning the inclusion of the
94 units in the property insurance coverage does not apply to property insurance
95 maintained by an association which covers the peril of wildfire and which coordinates
96 with or subrogates individual policies of property insurance maintained by the units’
97 owners that cover the peril of wildfire.

17 3. The report may include any other information that the Commissioner
18 deems relevant.
19 Sec. 19. If the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a
20 participant has engaged in, is engaging in or threatens to engage in any act or
21 omission in violation of any provision of sections 2 to 20, inclusive, of this act or
22 any other applicable statute or regulation for which a civil or criminal penalty is
23 prescribed, the Commissioner may remove the participant from the Program or
24 order the participant to exit the Program.
25 Sec. 20. If the Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a
26 participant has engaged in, is engaging in or threatens to engage in any act or
27 omission that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent with the health, safety
28 or welfare of consumers or the public generally, the Commissioner may:
29 1. Proceed to adopt a regulation to address the issue pursuant to section 10
30 of this act;
31 2. Require the participant to comply with one or more provisions of this title
32 or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto;
33 3. Remove the participant from the Program or order the participant to exit
34 the Program; or
35 4. Take any combination of those actions.
36 Sec. 20.3. Chapter 686B of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
37 section to read as follows:
38 1. The Commissioner shall establish a program of flex-rated filing to allow
39 an insurer that issues a line of property insurance that provides coverage for real
40 property to make a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for that line of
41 insurance under the program, in lieu of making a filing pursuant to NRS
42 686B.070, if the proposed increase does not exceed either of the flex-rated filing
43 thresholds established by the Commissioner and all other requirements of this
44 section are met.
45 2. To qualify for filing under the program of flex-rated filing established
46 pursuant to this section:
47 (a) The filing must be limited solely to a proposed increase in a rate and must
48 not contain changes to any supplementary rate information;
49 (b) The proposed increase in the rate must not exceed either of the flex-rated
50 filing thresholds which are in effect at the time the filing is made;
51 (c) The proposed increase must not take effect for any existing policyholder
52 that will be affected by the proposed increase until the date on which the policy of
53 the policyholder is renewed; and

Senate Amendment No. 930 to Assembly Bill No. 376 First Reprint Page 10
1 (d) The date on which the first existing policyholder will be affected by the
2 proposed increase must be not earlier than 45 days after the date on which the
3 filing is made.
4 3. An insurer may not make a filing for a proposed increase in a rate under
5 the program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this section if:
6 (a) The cumulative effect of the filing and all other filings filed by the
7 insurer on the same line of insurance within the 12 months immediately
8 preceding the proposed effective date of the proposed increase exceeds either of
9 the flex-rated filing thresholds which are in effect on the date the filing is made;
10 and
11 (b) Any policyholder that will be affected by the proposed increase has been
12 affected by an increase filed under the program of flex-rated filing within the 12
13 months immediately preceding the proposed effective date of the proposed
14 increase.
15 4. The Commissioner shall review each proposed increase in a rate filed
16 under the program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this section. If the
17 Commissioner, within 15 days after the date on which the filing is made, finds
18 that a proposed increase does not comply with the provisions of subsection 2 or 3
19 or subsection 1 of NRS 686B.050, the Commissioner shall provide notice to the
20 insurer and subsequently treat the filing as if it were filed pursuant to NRS
21 686B.070. If the Commissioner has not provided the notice to the insurer within
22 15 days after the date on which the filing is made, the filing shall be deemed to be
23 approved.
24 5. On or before June 1, 2026, the Commissioner shall establish the
25 maximum percentage of overall rate impact and the maximum percentage of
26 individual rate disruption for a filing for a proposed increase in a rate to qualify
27 for filing under the program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this
28 section. Thereafter, on or before June 1 of any year, the Commissioner may
29 adjust the flex-rated filing thresholds to take effect on June 1 of that year. In
30 establishing the initial and adjusted flex-rated filing thresholds pursuant to this
31 subsection, the Commissioner shall:
32 (a) Before establishing the flex-rated filing thresholds, solicit public input
33 and hold a public hearing on the matter to consider past and future economic
34 conditions; and
35 (b) Establish the maximum percentage of overall rate impact to be a
36 percentage that is not less than 3 percent.
37 6. For the purposes of this section, the filing of a proposed increase in a
38 rate under the program of flex-rated filing established pursuant to this section
39 shall be deemed to be made on the date on which it is submitted to the
40 Commissioner using the System for Electronic Rates and Forms Filing developed
41 and implemented by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or
42 any successor system.
43 7. The Commissioner may adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of
44 this section.
45 8. As used in this section:
46 (a) “Flex-rated filing threshold” means the maximum percentage of:
47 (1) Overall rate impact; and
48 (2) Individual rate disruption,
49  that the Commissioner has established pursuant to subsection 5 for a filing for
50 a proposed increase in a rate to qualify for filing under the program of flex-rated
51 filing established pursuant to this section.
52 (b) “Individual rate disruption” means the largest percentage increase in the
53 amount of the premiums of any single policyholder affected by a filing for a

Senate Amendment No. 930 to Assembly Bill No. 376 First Reprint Page 11
1 proposed increase in a rate that will occur if the proposed increase becomes
2 effective.

13 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
14 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
15 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
16 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
17 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
18 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
19 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
20 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
21 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
22 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
23 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
24 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
25 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
26 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
27 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
28 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
29 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
30 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
31 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
32 record that is not otherwise confidential.
33 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
34 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
35 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
36 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
37 (a) The public record:
38 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
39 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
40 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
41 electronic medium would:
42 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
43 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
44 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
45 otherwise confidential.
46 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
47 custody or control of a public record:
48 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
49 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
50 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
51 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
52 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
53 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
