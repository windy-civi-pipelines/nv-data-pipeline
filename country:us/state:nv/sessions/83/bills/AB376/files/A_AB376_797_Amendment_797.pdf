Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commissioner of Insurance to regulate insurance in this State
2 and enforce the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code. (NRS 679B.120) Section 9 of this
3 bill requires the Commissioner to establish and administer the Regulatory Experimentation
4 Program for Insurance Product Innovation, which is a 4-year program to enable an authorized
5 insurer who offers at least one insurance product that provides property insurance coverage
6 for real or personal property located in this State outside of the Program to test a qualified
7 insurance product in this State without [obtaining any authorization or] complying with [any
8 of the] certain provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code or [the] certain regulations adopted
9 pursuant thereto that would otherwise be required outside of the Program. Section 7 of this
10 bill defines “qualified insurance product” to mean an insurance product that provides
11 property insurance coverage for real or personal property located in this State . [that is
12 valued at $250,000 or more.]
13 Section 12 of this bill sets forth the process by which an authorized insurer may apply to
14 participate in the Program. Section 12 requires the application of the applicant to include,
15 among other information, an explanation of any exemption from the provisions of the
16 Nevada Insurance Code or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto that the applicant
17 is requesting. Section 13 of this bill requires the Commissioner to approve or deny an

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 4
18 application within 90 days after the completed application is received. Section 14 of this bill
19 requires the Commissioner to provide written notice of the approval or denial of an
20 application . [and authorizes an applicant to appeal a denial of an application to the Director of
21 the Department of Business and Industry.] Under section 15 of this bill, if an application is
22 approved, the qualified insurance product offered or provided through the Program, with
23 certain exceptions, is exempt from the provisions of the Nevada Insurance Code and [any] the
24 regulations adopted pursuant thereto [.] for which an exemption was requested in the
25 application to participate in the Program. Section 15 also limits the period of testing for
26 a qualified insurance product under the Program to 36 months, with one extension of
27 not more than 12 months if approved by the Commissioner.
28 Section 10 of this bill requires the Commissioner to adopt [regulations establishing
29 protections for consumers of qualified insurance products provided through the Program and
30 authorizes the Commissioner to adopt any other] regulations to carry out the Program.
31 Section 11 of this bill requires certain disclosures to be provided before providing a
32 consumer a qualified insurance product through the Program.
33 Section 16 of this bill sets forth certain requirements relating to the retention of records
34 and reporting by a participant in the Program. Sections 17 and 26 of this bill set forth certain
35 requirements concerning the confidentiality and disclosure of records relating to the Program.
36 Section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to submit a report to the Legislature
37 concerning the Program on or before January 1, 2029.
38 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Commissioner to take certain actions against
39 a participant in the Program who commits certain violations or engages in any act or omission
40 that the Commissioner determines is inconsistent with the health, safety or welfare of
41 consumers or the public generally.
42 Sections 3-8 of this bill define certain words and terms relating to the Program.
43 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, insurers and certain rate service
44 organizations are required to file with the Commissioner all rates and proposed increases
45 thereto, as well as the forms of policies to which the rates apply, supplementary rate
46 information and any changes or amendments to the rates. Existing law requires that such a
47 filing be filed not less than 30 days before the proposed effective date of the filing, with
48 certain exceptions. (NRS 686B.070) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the
49 Commissioner is required to approve or disapprove a proposed increase or decrease in a rate
50 for any kind or line of insurance, other than certain health plans. (NRS 686B.110) [Sections
51 21-25 of this bill revise those provisions to allow an insurer to implement a proposed increase
52 or decrease in certain rates while the process for the approval or disapproval proceeds.
53 Section 21 requires a filing for a proposed increase or decrease in a rate for any kind or
54 line of insurance for which the filing of rates is required, other than certain health plans, to be
55 filed on or before the proposed effective date included in the filing. Section 21 authorizes an
56 insurer to implement such a proposed increase or decrease while the proposal is pending
57 approval or disapproval by the Commissioner.
58 Section 23 provides that if the Commissioner disapproves such a proposed increase or
59 decrease and the insurer has implemented the proposed increase or decrease, the
60 Commissioner is required to issue a written order that includes, among other things, the date
61 on which the disapproved increased or decreased rate must no longer be used for the issuance
62 of new policies or contracts or the renewal of existing policies or contracts. Under section 23,
63 the order does not affect any policy or contract made before the effective date of the order,
64 except that the Commissioner is authorized to require that the premiums be adjusted after the
65 effective date of the order for those policies or contracts in effect on the effective date of the
66 order.
67 Under existing law, if a filing for a proposed increase in a rate is not accompanied by
68 certain information, the Commissioner is authorized to inform the insurer and the filing is
69 deemed to be made when the information is furnished. (NRS 686B.100) Section 22 deems a
70 filing for a proposed increase in a rate for any kind or line of insurance, other than certain
71 health plans, for the purpose of implementing the proposed increase pending the approval or
72 disapproval of the Commissioner to be filed on the date on which it is filed with the
73 Commissioner, regardless of whether the filing is accompanied by such information.
74 Similarly, existing law provides that if the Commissioner determines that a proposal to
75 increase or decrease a rate is incomplete, the Commissioner must notify the insurer or rate
76 service organization of that determination and, if the insurer does not provide the necessary

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 5
77 documents or other information within 30 days after the receipt of that notice, the
78 Commissioner is authorized to disapprove the proposal. (NRS 686B.110) Section 23 provides
79 that a determination that a proposal to increase or decrease a rate for any kind or line of
80 insurance, other than certain health plans, is incomplete does not prohibit an insurer from
81 implementing the proposed increase or decrease pending approval or disapproval.]
82 Sections [24 and 25 make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been
83 renumbered by section] 20.3 and 21 [.] of this bill provide an alternative method by which
84 certain insurers may make a filing for a proposed increase in a rate for certain types of
85 insurance. Section 20.3 requires the Commissioner to establish a program of flex-rated
86 filing to allow an insurer that issues certain lines of property insurance to make a filing
87 for that line of insurance if the proposed increase does not exceed certain thresholds
88 established by the Commissioner and certain other requirements are met. Section 20.3
89 sets forth certain requirements for making a filing for a proposed increase in a rate to
90 qualify to be filed under the program of flex-rated filing. If the Commissioner finds,
91 within 15 days after the filing is made, that the filing fails to meet such requirements,
92 section 20.3 authorizes the Commissioner to treat the filing in the same manner as other
93 proposed increases in a rate filed outside the program of flex-rated filing. If the
94 Commissioner does not make such a determination within that time, the filing is deemed
95 to be approved. Section 20.5 of this bill applies the definitions set forth under existing
96 law governing rate filings to the provisions of section 20.3. Section 20.7 of this bill
97 excludes property insurance for business and commercial risks from the provisions of
98 section 20.3.
99 Section 25.1 of this bill authorizes an insurer that issues a policy of property
100 insurance to exclude the peril of wildfire from the coverage provided under the policy.
101 Section 25.1 additionally authorizes an insurer to issue a policy of property insurance
102 that solely covers the peril of wildfire.
103 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions for the operation of a
104 reciprocal insurer. (Chapter 694B of NRS) Existing law sets forth certain rules that the
105 Commissioner is required to apply in determining the financial condition of a reciprocal
106 insurer, including rules concerning the computation of reserves. (NRS 694B.150) Section
107 25.3 of this bill revises those rules concerning reserves to require instead that the
108 reserves of a reciprocal insurer be maintained as required by section 25.2 of this bill.
109 Section 25.2 requires a reciprocal insurer at all times to maintain an unearned premium
110 reserve in a certain amount and sets forth the manner in which that amount must be
111 calculated. If, at any time, the amount of the unearned premium reserve maintained by a
112 reciprocal insurer is less than $100,000, section 25.2 requires the reciprocal insurer to
113 maintain cash or securities acceptable to the Commissioner in an amount that, when
114 added to the amount of the unearned premium reserve maintained, equals not less than
115 $100,000.
116 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of captive insurers. (Chapter
117 694C of NRS) Section 25.5 of this bill removes provisions prohibiting a captive insurer
118 from directly providing homeowners’ insurance coverage. Section 25.5 authorizes an
119 association captive insurer to insure the risks of individual homeowners who combine
120 into an association for the purpose of procuring homeowners’ insurance or the risks of
121 individual units’ owners in a common-interest community so long as the association
122 captive insurer is owned by the association created by the homeowners or the unit-
123 owners’ association, as applicable. Sections 25.4 and 25.5 of this bill authorize a
124 sponsored captive insurer to insure the risks of individual homeowners who elect to
125 become a participant of a protected cell of a sponsored captive insurer.
126 Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association in a common-interest community to
127 maintain certain insurance coverage, including property insurance on the common
128 elements of the community. (NRS 116.3113) Section 25.6 of this bill removes provisions
129 which require such property insurance for buildings with units divided by certain
130 boundaries to include the units to the extent reasonably available. Section 25.7 of this bill
131 makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to provisions removed in section
132 25.6.

29 that a proposed increase does not comply with the provisions of subsection 2 or 3
30 or subsection 1 of NRS 686B.050, the Commissioner shall provide notice to the
31 insurer and subsequently treat the filing as if it were filed pursuant to NRS

40 adjust the flex-rated filing thresholds to take effect on June 1 of that year. In
41 establishing the initial and adjusted flex-rated filing thresholds pursuant to this
42 subsection, the Commissioner shall:
43 (a) Before establishing the flex-rated filing thresholds, solicit public input
44 and hold a public hearing on the matter to consider past and future economic
45 conditions; and
46 (b) Establish the maximum percentage of overall rate impact to be a
47 percentage that is not less than 3 percent.
48 6. For the purposes of this section, the filing of a proposed increase in a

15 obtained by dividing the total aggregate amount by which all premiums for all
16 policyholders affected by a filing for a proposed increase in a rate will be
17 increased if the proposed increase becomes effective by the total aggregate
18 amount of all premiums for those policyholders on the day immediately preceding

30 (Deleted by amendment.)
31 Sec. 23. [NRS 686B.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 686B.110 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 686B.112, the
33 Commissioner shall consider each proposed increase or decrease in the rate of any
34 kind or line of insurance or subdivision thereof filed with the Commissioner
35 pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 686B.070. If the Commissioner finds that a
36 proposed increase will result in a rate which is not in compliance with NRS
37 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070, the Commissioner shall disapprove
38 the proposal. The Commissioner shall approve or disapprove each proposal no later
39 than 30 days after it is determined by the Commissioner to be complete pursuant to
40 subsection 6. If the Commissioner fails to approve or disapprove the proposal
41 within that period, the proposal shall be deemed approved.
42 2. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed increase or decrease in any
43 rate pursuant to subsection 1, the Commissioner shall send a written notice of
44 disapproval to the insurer or the rate service organization that filed the proposal.
45 The notice must set forth the reasons the proposal is not in compliance with NRS
46 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS 686B.070 and must be sent to the insurer or
47 the rate service organization not more than 30 days after the Commissioner
48 determines that the proposal is complete pursuant to subsection 6.
49 3. Upon receipt of a written notice of disapproval from the Commissioner
50 pursuant to subsection 2 or 6, the insurer or rate service organization may request
51 that the Commissioner reconsider the proposed increase or decrease. The request
52 for reconsideration must be received by the Commissioner not more than 30 days
53 after the insurer or rate service organization receives the written notice of

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 15
1 disapproval from the Commissioner, except that if the insurer or rate service
2 organization requests, in writing, an extension of 30 additional days in which to
3 request a reconsideration, the Commissioner shall grant the extension. A request for
4 reconsideration submitted pursuant to this subsection may include, without
5 limitation, any documents or other information for review by the Commissioner in
6 reconsidering the proposal. The Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the
7 proposal upon reconsideration not later than 30 days after receipt of the request for
8 reconsideration and shall notify the insurer or rate service organization of his or her
9 approval or disapproval.
10 4. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result of the
11 Commissioner’s disapproval of rates or other act, the Commissioner shall on
12 request specify interim rates for the insurer that are high enough to protect the
13 interests of all parties and may order that a specified portion of the premiums be
14 placed in an escrow account approved by the Commissioner. When new rates
15 become legally effective, the Commissioner shall order the escrowed funds or any
16 overcharge in the interim rates to be distributed appropriately, except that refunds
17 to policyholders that are de minimis must not be required.
18 5. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed rate pursuant to subsection 1
19 or subsection 6 or upon reconsideration pursuant to subsection 3 and an insurer
20 requests a hearing to determine the validity of the action of the Commissioner, the
21 insurer has the burden of showing compliance with the applicable standards for
22 rates established in NRS 686B.010 to 686B.1799, inclusive. Any such hearing must
23 be held:
24 (a) Within 30 days after the request for a hearing has been submitted to the
25 Commissioner; or
26 (b) Within a period agreed upon by the insurer and the Commissioner.
27  If the hearing is not held within the period specified in paragraph (a) or (b), or if
28 the Commissioner fails to issue an order concerning the proposed rate for which the
29 hearing is held within 45 days after the hearing, the proposed rate shall be deemed
30 approved.
31 6. The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the documents or any other
32 information which must be included in a proposal to increase or decrease a rate
33 submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1. Each such proposal shall
34 be deemed complete upon its filing with the Commissioner, unless the
35 Commissioner, within 15 business days after the proposal is filed with the
36 Commissioner, determines that the proposal is incomplete because the proposal
37 does not comply with the regulations adopted by the Commissioner pursuant to this
38 subsection. The determination of the Commissioner that a proposal is incomplete
39 does not prohibit an insurer from implementing a proposed increase or decrease
40 in a rate pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 686B.070. The Commissioner shall
41 notify the insurer or rate service organization if the Commissioner determines that
42 the proposal is incomplete. The notice must be sent within 15 business days after
43 the proposal is filed with the Commissioner and must set forth the documents or
44 other information that is required to complete the proposal. The Commissioner may
45 disapprove the proposal if the insurer or rate service organization fails to provide
46 the documents or other information to the Commissioner within 30 days after the
47 insurer or rate service organization receives the notice that the proposal is
48 incomplete. If the Commissioner disapproves the proposal pursuant to this
49 subsection, the Commissioner shall notify the insurer or rate service organization of
50 that fact in writing.
51 7. If the Commissioner disapproves a proposed increase or decrease in a
52 rate pursuant to subsection 1 or 6, upon reconsideration pursuant to subsection 3
53 or after a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 5 and the insurer has

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 16
1 implemented the proposed increase or decrease pending approval or disapproval
2 by the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 686B.070, the
3 Commissioner shall issue a written order that includes, without limitation, the
4 specific reasons for the disapproval, with citations to relevant statutes, and the
5 date on which the disapproved increased or decreased rate must no longer be
6 used for the issuance of new policies or contracts or the renewal of existing
7 policies or contracts. The date established by the Commissioner must be not less
8 than 90 days after the written order is issued. Except as otherwise provided in this
9 subsection, the order does not affect any policy or contract made before the
10 effective date of the order. The Commissioner may require that the premiums be
11 adjusted after the effective date of the order for those policies or contracts in
12 effect on the effective date of the order.] (Deleted by amendment.)

17 limitation, long-term care and Medicare supplement plans, filed with the
18 Commissioner pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 686B.070. If the Commissioner
19 finds that a proposed rate which is contained in a rate filing will result in a rate
20 which is not in compliance with NRS 686B.050 or subsection [3] 4 of NRS
21 686B.070, the Commissioner shall disapprove the rate filing. The Commissioner
22 shall approve or disapprove each rate filing not later than 60 days after the rate
23 filing is determined by the Commissioner to be complete pursuant to subsection 4.
24 If the Commissioner fails to approve or disapprove the rate filing within that period,
25 the rate filing shall be deemed approved.
26 2. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result of the
27 Commissioner’s disapproval of rates or other act, the Commissioner shall on
28 request specify interim rates for the insurer that are high enough to protect the
29 interests of all parties and may order that a specified portion of the premiums be
30 placed in an escrow account approved by the Commissioner. When new rates
31 become legally effective, the Commissioner shall order the escrowed funds or any
32 overcharge in the interim rates to be distributed appropriately, except that refunds
33 to policyholders that are de minimis must not be required.
34 3. If the Commissioner disapproves a rate filing pursuant to subsection 1, and
35 an insurer requests a hearing to determine the validity of the action of the
36 Commissioner, the insurer has the burden of showing compliance with the
37 applicable standards for rates established in NRS 686B.010 to 686B.1799,
38 inclusive. Any such hearing must be held:
39 (a) Within 30 days after the request for a hearing has been submitted to the
40 Commissioner; or
41 (b) Within a period agreed upon by the insurer and the Commissioner.
42  If the hearing is not held within the period specified in paragraph (a) or (b), or if
43 the Commissioner fails to issue an order concerning the rate filing for which the
44 hearing is held within 45 days after the hearing, the rate filing shall be deemed
45 approved.
46 4. The Commissioner shall by regulation specify the documents or any other
47 information which must be included in a rate filing submitted to the Commissioner
48 pursuant to subsection 1. Each such rate filing shall be deemed complete upon its
49 filing with the Commissioner, unless the Commissioner, within 15 business days
50 after the rate filing is filed with the Commissioner, determines that the rate filing is
51 incomplete because the rate filing does not comply with the regulations adopted by
52 the Commissioner pursuant to this subsection.

8 of the practitioner’s professional duty toward a patient, any interested person, and

27 the variance.
28 4. As used in this section, “wildfire” means an unplanned and uncontrolled
29 fire in an area of combustible vegetation that originated from outside any
30 residential or commercial property.

40 by a reciprocal insurer pursuant to subsection 1 is less than $100,000, the
41 reciprocal insurer shall maintain cash or securities acceptable to the

33 Sec. 25.6. NRS 116.3113 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 116.3113 1. Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a
35 unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent
36 reasonably available and subject to reasonable deductibles, all of the following:
37 (a) Property insurance on the common elements and, in a planned community,
38 also on property that must become common elements, insuring against risks of
39 direct physical loss commonly insured against, which insurance, after application of
40 any deductibles, must be not less than 80 percent of the actual cash value of the
41 insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date,
42 exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from
43 property policies.
44 (b) Commercial general liability insurance, including insurance for medical
45 payments, in an amount determined by the executive board but not less than any
46 amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured
47 against for bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with
48 the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements and, in cooperatives,
49 also of all units.
50 (c) Crime insurance which includes coverage for dishonest acts by members of
51 the executive board and the officers, employees, agents, directors and volunteers of
52 the association and which extends coverage to any business entity that acts as the
53 community manager of the association and the employees of that entity. Such

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 20
1 insurance may not contain a conviction requirement, and the minimum amount of
2 the policy must be not less than an amount equal to 3 months of aggregate
3 assessments on all units plus reserve funds or $5,000,000, whichever is less.
4 (d) Directors and officers insurance that is a nonprofit organization errors and
5 omissions policy in a minimum aggregate amount of not less than $1,000,000
6 naming the association as the owner and the named insured. The coverage must
7 extend to the members of the executive board and the officers, employees, agents,
8 directors and volunteers of the association and to the community manager of the
9 association and any employees thereof while acting as agents as insured persons
10 under the policy terms. Coverage must be subject to the terms listed in the
11 declaration.
12 2. [In the case of a building that contains units divided by horizontal
13 boundaries described in the declaration, or vertical boundaries that comprise
14 common walls between units, the insurance maintained under paragraph (a) of
15 subsection 1, to the extent reasonably available, must include the units, but need not
16 include improvements and betterments installed by units’ owners.
17 3.] If the insurance described in [subsections] subsection 1 [and 2] is not
18 reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be
19 given to all units’ owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any
20 other insurance, and the association may carry any other insurance it considers
21 appropriate to protect the association or the units’ owners.
22 [4.] 3. An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit’s
23 owner from obtaining insurance for the unit’s owner’s own benefit.
24 Sec. 25.7. NRS 116.31133 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 116.31133 1. Insurance policies carried pursuant to NRS 116.3113 must
26 provide that:
27 (a) Each unit’s owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to
28 liability arising out of the unit’s owner’s interest in the common elements or
29 membership in the association;
30 (b) The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any
31 unit’s owner or member of his or her household;
32 (c) No act or omission by any unit’s owner, unless acting within the scope of
33 his or her authority on behalf of the association, voids the policy or is a condition to
34 recovery under the policy; and
35 (d) If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the
36 name of a unit’s owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the
37 association’s policy provides primary insurance.
38 2. Any loss covered by the property policy under [subsections] subsection 1
39 [and 2] of NRS 116.3113 must be adjusted with the association, but the proceeds
40 for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or
41 otherwise to the association, and not to any holder of a security interest. The
42 insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for
43 the association, units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject
44 to NRS 116.31135, the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration
45 of the damaged property, and the association, units’ owners, and lienholders are not
46 entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus
47 of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored, or the
48 common-interest community is terminated.
49 3. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue
50 certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request,
51 to any unit’s owner or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy
52 may not cancel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed
53 cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit’s owner

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 21
1 and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of
2 insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses.

25 710.159, 711.600, and section 17 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
26 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
27 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
28 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
29 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
30 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
31 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
32 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
33 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
34 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
35 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
36 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
37 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
38 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
39 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
40 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
41 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
42 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
43 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
44 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
45 record that is not otherwise confidential.
46 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
47 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
48 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
49 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
50 (a) The public record:
51 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
52 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or

Assembly Amendment No. 797 to Assembly Bill No. 376 Page 23
1 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
2 electronic medium would:
3 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
4 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
5 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
6 otherwise confidential.
7 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
8 custody or control of a public record:
9 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
10 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
11 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
12 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
13 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
14 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
15 Sec. 27. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
16 2. Sections 25.4 to 25.7, inclusive, of this act become effective on July 1,
17 2025.
18 3. Sections 1 to 25.3, inclusive, and 26 [, inclusive,] of this act become
19 effective:
20 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
21 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
22 out the provisions of this act; and
23 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
