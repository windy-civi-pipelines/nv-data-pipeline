Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing parentage and the establishment of
2 parent and child relationships. (Chapter 126 of NRS) Sections 29-90 of this bill
3 generally replace such provisions with provisions modeled after those of the
4 Uniform Parentage Act (hereinafter “UPA”), adopted by the Uniform Law
5 Commission in 2017. Sections 4-27 of this bill define terms for the purposes of
6 chapter 126 of NRS that are modeled after the definitions of the terms used in the
7 UPA.
8 Existing law provides the manner in which the legal relationship of a mother
9 and child can be established, including: (1) except in the case of a gestational
10 agreement, proof that a woman gave birth to a child; (2) an adjudication that a
11 woman is the mother of a child; (3) proof that a woman has adopted a child; (4) an
12 unrebutted presumption of a woman’s maternity; (5) the consent of a woman to
13 assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; or (6) an adjudication
14 confirming a woman as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier. (NRS
15 126.041) Existing law also provides the manner in which the legal relationship of a
16 father and child can be established, including: (1) an adjudication that a man is the
17 father of a child; (2) proof that a man has adopted a child; (3) the consent of a man
18 to assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; (4) an adjudication
19 confirming a man as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier; (5) a
20 presumption of paternity that arises if a man was married to or cohabitating with
21 the natural mother of a child or resides with and holds out a child as his natural
22 child; (6) genetic testing establishing a man as the father of a child; or (7) a
23 voluntary acknowledgment of paternity by a man. (NRS 126.041, 126.051,
24 126.053) Section 35 uses the gender-neutral language of the UPA to set forth the
25 circumstances in which a parent and child relationship is established between a
26 person and a child. Similarly, section 38 uses the gender-neutral language of the
27 UPA to establish the circumstances in which a person is presumed to be a parent of
28 a child.
29 Sections 39-52 establish provisions modeled after those of the UPA relating to
30 the voluntary acknowledgment or voluntary denial of parentage by certain persons,
31 including provisions relating to the requirement for, rescission of and challenge to
32 an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage. Section 43 provides that,
33 unless an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage is rescinded or
34 challenged, such an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage that meets
35 all requirements of law and is filed with the State Registrar of Vital Statistics is
36 equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a child or the nonparentage of a
37 person, respectively. Section 44 prohibits the State Registrar of Vital Statistics
38 from charging a fee for filing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
39 parentage, and section 52 authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt any
40 necessary regulations relating to an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
41 parentage.
42 Existing law provides that in an action to determine paternity, a court is
43 authorized or required depending on the circumstances, to order genetic testing of a
44 mother, child, alleged father or any other person. (NRS 126.121) Sections 53-67
45 establish various provisions modeled after those of the UPA concerning genetic
46 testing, including: (1) the limitation on the use of genetic testing; (2) the authority
47 to order, facilitate or deny genetic testing; (3) the requirements of genetic testing;
48 (4) reports and costs of genetic testing; (5) additional genetic testing when a result
49 is contested; (6) genetic testing when a specimen is not available from an alleged
50 genetic parent; and (7) genetic testing of a deceased person or identical sibling.
51 Section 67 provides that a person commits a misdemeanor, if without proper
52 authority, he or she intentionally releases an identifiable specimen of another
53 person collected for genetic testing for a purpose not relevant to a proceeding
54 regarding parentage.

55 Existing law establishes various provisions relating to an action to determine
56 paternity or maternity. (NRS 126.071-126.231) Sections 68-88 replace several of
57 those provisions with provisions modeled after those of the UPA governing
58 proceedings to adjudicate parentage. Existing law provides that if an action to
59 determine paternity is brought before the birth of a child, all proceedings are
60 generally required to be stayed until after the birth of the child. (NRS 126.071)
61 Section 83 instead authorizes a proceeding to adjudicate parentage to be
62 commenced, and an order or judgment to be entered before the birth of a child, but
63 requires enforcement of the order or judgment to be stayed until after the birth of
64 the child.
65 Existing law does not bar an action to determine paternity until 3 years after the
66 child reaches the age of majority. (NRS 126.081) Sections 74 and 75 instead
67 provide that a proceeding to determine whether an alleged genetic parent or
68 presumed parent, respectively, is a parent of a child may be commenced after the
69 child becomes an adult if the child initiates the proceeding.
70 Existing law requires that an informal hearing be held after an action to
71 determine paternity has been brought and further requires a court to attempt to
72 resolve the issues raised in the action during the pretrial hearing. (NRS 126.111)
73 Section 139 of this bill repeals the provisions relating to such a pretrial hearing, as
74 the UPA does not require any such pretrial hearing to be conducted.
75 Section 76 authorizes a person who claims to be a de facto parent of a child to
76 commence a proceeding to establish parentage of the child if the child is alive and
77 less than 18 years of age. Section 76 provides that a person who claims to be a de
78 facto parent of a child must be adjudicated as a parent of the child if there is only
79 one other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child and the
80 person who claims to be a de facto parent can demonstrate certain facts by clear and
81 convincing evidence. Section 80 authorizes a court to adjudicate a child to have
82 more than two parents if the court finds that failure to recognize more than two
83 parents would be detrimental to the child.
84 Existing law establishes provisions concerning assisted reproduction and
85 gestational surrogacy. (NRS 126.500-126.810) This bill establishes only certain
86 provisions modeled after those of the UPA relating to such matters. Section 91 of
87 this bill establishes provisions relating to the parental status of certain persons who
88 die before a child is conceived by assisted reproduction. Section 92 of this bill
89 authorizes a party to a gestational agreement to terminate the agreement at any time
90 before an embryo transfer or, if an embryo transfer does not result in pregnancy, at
91 any time before a subsequent embryo transfer.
92 Existing law requires a gestational agreement to provide for the express written
93 agreement of the gestational carrier to undergo embryo or gamete transfer and
94 attempt to carry and give birth to any resulting child. (NRS 126.750) Section 107
95 of this bill requires a gestational agreement to also provide for the express written
96 agreement of the gestational carrier and any legal spouse or domestic partner of the
97 gestational carrier to acknowledge that each intended parent is the legal and
98 physical custodian of any resulting child. Section 107 also specifies that a
99 gestational carrier has the right to make all health and welfare decisions regarding
100 the gestational carrier and the pregnancy of the gestational carrier, including
101 whether to: (1) consent to a cesarean section or the transfer of multiple embryos;
102 (2) use the services of a health care practitioner chosen by the gestational carrier;
103 (3) terminate or continue the pregnancy; and (4) reduce or retain the number of
104 fetuses or embryos carried by the gestational carrier. Section 107 further provides
105 that any provision in a gestational agreement that contradicts such a right is void
106 and unenforceable.
107 Existing law provides that the subsequent marriage or domestic partnership of a
108 gestational carrier after the execution of a gestational agreement does not affect the
109 validity of the agreement. (NRS 126.770) Section 108 of this bill provides that the
-
*AB424*
– 4 –
110 subsequent marriage, domestic partnership or divorce of any party to a gestational
111 agreement does not affect the validity of the agreement unless the agreement
112 expressly provides otherwise.
113 Existing law provides that if a gestational carrier breaches a gestational
114 agreement, a specific performance remedy that would require the gestational carrier
115 to be impregnated is prohibited. (NRS 126.780) Section 109 of this bill instead
116 provides that specific performance is not an available remedy with regard to a
117 gestational agreement except to enforce any provision in the agreement that is
118 necessary to enable the intended parents to exercise the full rights of parentage
119 immediately upon the birth of the child, if the intended parents are being prevented
120 from exercising such rights.
121 Sections 98-106 of this bill make various other changes to the provisions of
122 existing law concerning assisted reproduction and gestational surrogacy.
123 Section 139 repeals provisions of existing law that are not necessary because
124 of the establishment of the provisions modeled after those of the UPA in
125 sections 29-90.
126 Sections 1, 93-97, 110-136 and 139 of this bill make conforming changes to
127 reflect the revisions made to existing law because of the establishment of the
128 provisions modeled after those of the UPA in sections 29-90 and the repeal of
129 unnecessary provisions in section 139.

35 under section 46 of this act or challenged successfully under
36 section 47 of this act; or
37 (b) Been adjudicated to be a parent of the child.
38 Sec. 42. 1. An acknowledgment of parentage and a denial
39 of parentage may be contained in a single document or may be in
40 counterparts and may be filed with the State Registrar of Vital
41 Statistics separately or simultaneously. If filing of the
42 acknowledgment and denial both are required under sections 29 to
43 90, inclusive, of this act, neither is effective until both are filed.
44 2. An acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage
45 may only be signed after the birth of the child.

1 3. Subject to subsection 1, an acknowledgment of parentage
2 or denial of parentage takes effect on the filing of the document
3 with the State Registrar of Vital Statistics.
4 4. An acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage
5 signed by a person who is a minor is valid if the acknowledgment
6 complies with sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act.
7 Sec. 43. 1. Except as otherwise provided in sections 46 and
8 47 of this act, an acknowledgment of parentage that complies with
9 sections 39 to 52, inclusive, of this act and is filed with the State
10 Registrar of Vital Statistics is equivalent to an adjudication of
11 parentage of the child and confers on the acknowledged parent all
12 rights and duties of a parent.
13 2. Except as otherwise provided in sections 46 and 47 of this
14 act, a denial of parentage by a presumed parent or alleged genetic
15 parent which complies with sections 39 to 52, inclusive, of this act
16 and is filed with the State Registrar of Vital Statistics with an
17 acknowledgment of parentage that complies with sections 39 to 52,
18 inclusive, of this act is equivalent to an adjudication of the
19 nonparentage of the presumed parent or alleged genetic parent
20 who signed the denial and discharges the presumed parent or
21 alleged genetic parent who signed the denial from all rights and
22 duties of a parent.
23 Sec. 44. The State Registrar of Vital Statistics may not
24 charge a fee for filing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial
25 of parentage.
26 Sec. 45. A court conducting a judicial proceeding or an
27 administrative agency conducting an administrative proceeding is
28 not required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged
29 acknowledgment of parentage. A court may determine that a
30 person who signed an acknowledgment of parentage is a parent in
31 a later proceeding based on other grounds.
32 Sec. 46. 1. A signatory may rescind an acknowledgment of
33 parentage or denial of parentage by filing with the State Registrar
34 of Vital Statistics a rescission in a signed record which is attested
35 by an electronic notary public or notarial officer or witnessed,
36 before the earlier of:
37 (a) Sixty days after the effective date under section 42 of this
38 act of the acknowledgment or denial; or
39 (b) The date of the first hearing before a court in a proceeding,
40 to which the signatory is a party, to adjudicate an issue relating to
41 the child, including a proceeding that establishes support.
42 2. If an acknowledgment of parentage is rescinded under
43 subsection 1, an associated denial of parentage is invalid, and the
44 State Registrar of Vital Statistics shall notify the person who gave
45 birth to the child and the person who signed a denial of parentage
-
*AB424*
– 12 –
1 of the child that the acknowledgment has been rescinded. Failure
2 to give the notice required by this subsection does not affect the
3 validity of the rescission.
4 Sec. 47. 1. After the period for rescission under section 46
5 of this act expires, but not later than 2 years after the effective date
6 under section 42 of this act of an acknowledgment of parentage or
7 denial of parentage, a signatory of the acknowledgment or denial
8 may commence a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment or
9 denial only on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of
10 fact.
11 2. A challenge to an acknowledgment of parentage or denial
12 of parentage by a person who was not a signatory to the
13 acknowledgment or denial is governed by section 77 of this act.
14 Sec. 48. 1. Every signatory to an acknowledgment of
15 parentage and any related denial of parentage must be made a
16 party to a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment or denial.
17 2. By signing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
18 parentage, a signatory submits to personal jurisdiction in this
19 State in a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment or denial,
20 effective on the filing of the acknowledgment or denial with the
21 State Registrar of Vital Statistics.
22 3. The court may not suspend the legal responsibilities
23 arising from an acknowledgment of parentage, including the duty
24 to pay child support, during the pendency of a proceeding to
25 challenge the acknowledgment or a related denial of parentage,
26 unless the party challenging the acknowledgment or denial shows
27 good cause.
28 4. A party challenging an acknowledgment of parentage or
29 denial of parentage has the burden of proof.
30 5. If the court determines that a party has satisfied the burden
31 of proof under subsection 4, the court shall order the State
32 Registrar of Vital Statistics to amend the birth record of the child
33 to reflect the legal parentage of the child.
34 6. A proceeding to challenge an acknowledgment of
35 parentage or denial of parentage must be conducted under
36 sections 68 to 88, inclusive, of this act.
37 Sec. 49. The court shall give full faith and credit to an
38 acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage effective in
39 another state if the acknowledgment or denial was in a signed
40 record and otherwise complies with the law of the other state.
41 Sec. 50. A valid acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
42 parentage is not affected by a later modification of the declaration
43 developed by the State Board of Health pursuant to NRS 440.285.
44 Sec. 51. The State Registrar of Vital Statistics may release
45 information relating to an acknowledgment of parentage or denial

1 of parentage to a signatory of the acknowledgment or denial, a
2 court, federal agency, agency which provides child welfare
3 services and child support agency of this or another state.
4 Sec. 52. The State Board of Health may adopt any
5 regulations that are necessary to implement sections 39 to 52,
6 inclusive, of this act.
7 Sec. 53. As used in sections 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act,
8 unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined
9 in sections 54, 55 and 56 of this act have the meanings ascribed to
10 them in those sections.
11 Sec. 54. “Ethnic or racial group” means, for the purpose of
12 genetic testing, a recognized group that a person identifies as the
13 person’s ancestry or part of the ancestry or that is identified by
14 other information.
15 Sec. 55. “Hypothesized genetic relationship” means an
16 asserted genetic relationship between a person and a child.
17 Sec. 56. “Relationship index” means a likelihood ratio that
18 compares the probability of a genetic marker given a hypothesized
19 genetic relationship and the probability of the genetic marker
20 given a genetic relationship between the child and a random
21 person of the ethnic or racial group used in the hypothesized
22 genetic relationship.
23 Sec. 57. 1. Sections 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act govern
24 genetic testing of a person in a proceeding to adjudicate
25 parentage, whether the person:
26 (a) Voluntarily submits to testing; or
27 (b) Is tested under an order of the court or as a result of the
28 facilitation of a child support agency.
29 2. Genetic testing may not be used:
30 (a) To challenge the parentage of a person who is a parent
31 under NRS 126.500 to 126.810, inclusive, and sections 91 and 92
32 of this act; or
33 (b) To establish the parentage of a person who is a donor.
34 Sec. 58. 1. Except as otherwise provided in sections 53 to
35 67, inclusive, or 68 to 88, inclusive, of this act, in a proceeding
36 under sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act to determine
37 parentage, the court shall order the child and any other person to
38 submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the
39 sworn statement of a party:
40 (a) Alleging a reasonable possibility that the person is the
41 child’s genetic parent; or
42 (b) Denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts
43 establishing a reasonable possibility that the person is not a
44 genetic parent.
-
*AB424*
– 14 –
1 2. A child support agency may facilitate genetic testing only if
2 there is no acknowledged or adjudicated parent of a child other
3 than the person who gave birth to the child.
4 3. The court may not order, and a child support agency may
5 not facilitate, in utero genetic testing.
6 4. If two or more persons are subject to court-ordered genetic
7 testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently
8 or sequentially.
9 5. Genetic testing of a person who gave birth to a child is not
10 a condition precedent to testing of the child and a person whose
11 genetic parentage of the child is being determined. If the person
12 who gave birth to the child is unavailable or declines to submit to
13 genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and
14 each person whose genetic parentage of the child is being
15 adjudicated.
16 6. In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child
17 having a presumed parent or a person who claims to be a parent
18 under section 76 of this act, or to challenge an acknowledgment of
19 parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the
20 child and any other person after considering the factors in
21 subsections 1 and 2 of section 80 of this act.
22 7. If a person requesting genetic testing is barred under
23 sections 68 to 88, inclusive, of this act from establishing the
24 person’s parentage, the court shall deny the request for genetic
25 testing.
26 8. An order under this section for genetic testing is
27 enforceable by contempt.
28 Sec. 59. 1. Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably
29 relied on by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in
30 a testing laboratory accredited by:
31 (a) The AABB, formerly known as the American Association
32 of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions; or
33 (b) An accrediting body designated by the Secretary of the
34 United States Department of Health and Human Services.
35 2. A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample
36 or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair or
37 other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing need
38 not be of the same kind for each person undergoing genetic
39 testing.
40 3. Based on the ethnic or racial group of a person
41 undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine
42 the databases from which to select frequencies for use in
43 calculating a relationship index. If a person or a child support
44 agency objects to the laboratory’s choice, the following rules
45 apply:
-
*AB424*
– 15 –
1 (a) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the report of the test,
2 the objecting person or child support agency may request the court
3 to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index
4 using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the
5 laboratory.
6 (b) The person or the child support agency objecting to the
7 laboratory’s choice under this subsection shall:
8 (1) If the requested frequencies are not available to the
9 laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the
10 requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by
11 accrediting bodies; or
12 (2) Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.
13 (c) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there
14 is a question which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The
15 laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if
16 available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.
17 4. If, after recalculation of the relationship index under
18 subsection 3 using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic
19 testing under section 61 of this act does not identify a person as a
20 genetic parent of a child, the court may require a person who has
21 been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a
22 genetic parent.
23 Sec. 60. 1. A report of genetic testing must be in a record
24 and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing
25 laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of sections
26 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act is self-authenticating.
27 2. Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following
28 information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody
29 and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without
30 testimony:
31 (a) The name and photograph of each person whose specimen
32 has been taken;
33 (b) The name of the person who collected each specimen;
34 (c) The place and date each specimen was collected;
35 (d) The name of the person who received each specimen in the
36 testing laboratory; and
37 (e) The date each specimen was received.
38 Sec. 61. 1. Subject to a challenge under subsection 2, a
39 person is identified under sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act as
40 a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with sections
41 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act and the results of the testing
42 disclose:
43 (a) The person has at least a 99-percent probability of
44 parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using
45 the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and
-
*AB424*
– 16 –
1 (b) A combined relationship index of at least 100 to 1.
2 2. A person identified under subsection 1 as a genetic parent
3 of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other
4 genetic testing satisfying the requirements of sections 53 to 67,
5 inclusive, of this act which:
6 (a) Excludes the person as a genetic parent of the child; or
7 (b) Identifies another person as a possible genetic parent of the
8 child other than:
9 (1) The person who gave birth to the child; or
10 (2) The person identified under subsection 1.
11 3. Except as otherwise provided in section 66 of this act, if
12 more than one person other than the person who gave birth to the
13 child is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of
14 the child, the court shall order each person to submit to further
15 genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.
16 4. As used in this section:
17 (a) “Combined relationship index” means the product of all
18 tested relationship indices.
19 (b) “Probability of parentage” means, for the ethnic or racial
20 group to which a person alleged to be a parent belongs, the
21 probability that a hypothesized genetic relationship is supported,
22 compared to the probability that a genetic relationship is
23 supported between the child and a random person of the ethnic or
24 racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship,
25 expressed as a percentage incorporating the combined
26 relationship index and a prior probability.
27 Sec. 62. 1. Subject to assessment of fees under sections 68
28 to 88, inclusive, of this act, payment of the cost of initial genetic
29 testing must be made in advance:
30 (a) By the person who made the request for genetic testing;
31 (b) As agreed by the parties; or
32 (c) As ordered by the court.
33 2. If the cost of genetic testing is paid by a child support
34 agency, the agency may seek reimbursement from the genetic
35 parent whose parent and child relationship is established.
36 Sec. 63. The court shall order, or a child support agency may
37 facilitate, additional genetic testing on request of a person who
38 contests the result of the initial testing under section 61 of this act.
39 If initial genetic testing under section 61 of this act identified a
40 person as a genetic parent of the child, the court may not order,
41 and a child support agency may not facilitate, additional testing
42 unless the contesting person pays for the testing in advance.
43 Sec. 64. 1. Subject to subsection 2, if a genetic-testing
44 specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a
45 child, a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause
-
*AB424*
– 17 –
1 and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may
2 order any of the following persons to submit specimens for genetic
3 testing:
4 (a) A parent of the alleged genetic parent;
5 (b) A sibling of the alleged genetic parent;
6 (c) Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the person
7 who gave birth to the other child; and
8 (d) Another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to
9 complete genetic testing.
10 2. To issue an order under this section, the court must find
11 that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of
12 the person sought to be tested.
13 Sec. 65. If a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates
14 good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased
15 person.
16 Sec. 66. 1. If the court finds there is reason to believe that
17 an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence
18 that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may
19 order genetic testing of the sibling.
20 2. If more than one sibling is identified under section 61 of
21 this act as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on
22 nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent
23 of the child.
24 Sec. 67. 1. Release of a report of genetic testing for
25 parentage is controlled by law of this State other than sections 29
26 to 90, inclusive, of this act.
27 2. A person who intentionally releases an identifiable
28 specimen of another person collected for genetic testing under
29 sections 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act for a purpose not relevant to
30 a proceeding regarding parentage, without a court order or written
31 permission of the person who furnished the specimen, is guilty of
32 a misdemeanor.
33 Sec. 68. 1. A proceeding may be commenced to adjudicate
34 the parentage of a child. Except as otherwise provided in sections
35 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act, the proceeding is governed by the
36 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.
37 2. A proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child born
38 under a gestational agreement is governed by NRS 126.500 to
39 126.810, inclusive, and sections 91 and 92 of this act.
40 3. As used in this section, “gestational agreement” has the
41 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 126.570.
42 Sec. 69. Except as otherwise provided in sections 39 to 52,
43 inclusive, and 75 to 78, inclusive, of this act, a proceeding to
44 adjudicate parentage may be maintained by:
45 1. The child;
-
*AB424*
– 18 –
1 2. The person who gave birth to the child, unless a court has
2 adjudicated that the person who gave birth to the child is not a
3 parent;
4 3. A person who is a parent under sections 29 to 90, inclusive,
5 of this act;
6 4. A person whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated;
7 5. A child support agency or other governmental agency
8 authorized by law of this State other than sections 29 to 90,
9 inclusive, of this act;
10 6. An adoption agency authorized by law of this State other
11 than sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act or licensed child-
12 placing agency;

14 sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act to act for a person who
15 otherwise would be entitled to maintain a proceeding but is
16 deceased, incapacitated or a minor; or
17 8. An agency which provides child welfare services in a
18 proceeding pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS.
19 Sec. 70. 1. The petitioner shall give notice of a proceeding
20 to adjudicate parentage to the following persons, if the
21 whereabouts of the person are known:
22 (a) The person who gave birth to the child, unless a court has
23 adjudicated that the person who gave birth to the child is not a
24 parent;
25 (b) A person who is a parent of the child under sections 29 to
26 90, inclusive, of this act;
27 (c) A presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated parent of the
28 child; and
29 (d) A person whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated.
30 2. A person entitled to notice under subsection 1 has a right
31 to intervene in the proceeding.
32 3. Lack of notice required by subsection 1 does not render a
33 judgment void. Lack of notice does not preclude a person entitled
34 to notice under subsection 1 from bringing a proceeding under
35 subsection 2 of section 78 of this act.
36 Sec. 71. 1. The court may adjudicate a person’s parentage
37 of a child only if the court has personal jurisdiction over the
38 person.
39 2. A court of this State with jurisdiction to adjudicate
40 parentage may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident if
41 the conditions prescribed in NRS 130.201 are satisfied.
42 3. Lack of jurisdiction over one person does not preclude the
43 court from making an adjudication of parentage binding on
44 another person.

– 19 –
1 Sec. 72. Venue for a proceeding to adjudicate parentage is in
2 the county of this State in which:
3 1. The child resides or is located;
4 2. If the child does not reside in this State, the respondent
5 resides or is located;
6 3. A proceeding has been commenced for administration of
7 the estate of a person who is or may be a parent under sections 29
8 to 90, inclusive, of this act; or

13 testing ordered by the court under section 58 of this act as
14 evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the report.
15 2. A party may object to the admission of a report described
16 in subsection 1, not later than 14 days after the party receives the
17 report. The party shall cite specific grounds for exclusion.
18 3. A party that objects to the results of genetic testing may
19 call a genetic-testing expert to testify in person or by another
20 method approved by the court. Unless the court orders otherwise,
21 the party offering the testimony bears the expense for the expert
22 testifying.
23 4. Admissibility of a report of genetic testing is not affected by
24 whether the testing was performed:
25 (a) Voluntarily, under an order of the court or as a result of
26 the facilitation of a child support agency; or
27 (b) Before, on or after commencement of the proceeding.
28 Sec. 74. 1. A proceeding to determine whether an alleged
29 genetic parent who is not a presumed parent is a parent of a child
30 may be commenced:
31 (a) Before the child becomes an adult; or
32 (b) After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child
33 initiates the proceeding.
34 2. This subsection applies in a proceeding described in
35 subsection 1 if the person who gave birth to the child is the only
36 other person with a claim to parentage of the child. The court
37 shall adjudicate an alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the
38 child if the alleged genetic parent:
39 (a) Is identified under section 61 of this act as a genetic parent
40 of the child and the identification is not successfully challenged
41 under section 61 of this act;
42 (b) Admits parentage in a pleading, when making an
43 appearance or during a hearing, the court accepts the admission
44 and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent
45 of the child;
-
*AB424*
– 20 –
1 (c) Declines to submit to genetic testing ordered by the court or
2 facilitated by a child support agency, in which case the court may
3 adjudicate the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child

5 with the child;
6 (d) Is in default after service of process and the court
7 determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child;
8 or
9 (e) Is neither identified nor excluded as a genetic parent by
10 genetic testing and, based on other evidence, the court determines
11 the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child.
12 3. Subject to other limitations in sections 73 to 80, inclusive,
13 of this act, if in a proceeding involving an alleged genetic parent,
14 at least one other person in addition to the person who gave birth
15 to the child has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall
16 adjudicate parentage under section 80 of this act.

19 (a) Before the child becomes an adult; or
20 (b) After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child
21 initiates the proceeding.
22 2. A presumption of parentage under section 38 of this act
23 cannot be overcome after the child attains 2 years of age unless
24 the court determines:
25 (a) The presumed parent is not a genetic parent, never resided
26 with the child and never held out the child as the presumed
27 parent’s child; or
28 (b) The child has more than one presumed parent.
29 3. The following rules apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a
30 presumed parent’s parentage of a child if the person who gave
31 birth to the child is the only other person with a claim to parentage
32 of the child:
33 (a) If there is not a party to the proceeding who challenges the
34 presumed parent’s parentage of the child, the court shall
35 adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child.
36 (b) If the presumed parent is identified under section 61 of this
37 act as a genetic parent of the child and that identification is not
38 successfully challenged under section 61 of this act, the court
39 shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child.
40 (c) If the presumed parent is not identified under section 61 of
41 this act as a genetic parent of the child and the presumed parent
42 or the person who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed
43 parent’s parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the
44 parentage of the child in the best interest of the child based on the
45 factors under subsections 1 and 2 of section 80 of this act.
-
*AB424*
– 21 –
1 4. Subject to other limitations in sections 73 to 80, inclusive,
2 of this act, if in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent’s
3 parentage of a child, another person in addition to the person who
4 gave birth to the child asserts a claim to parentage of the child, the
5 court shall adjudicate parentage under section 80 of this act.
6 Sec. 76. 1. A proceeding to establish parentage of a child
7 under this section may be commenced only by a person who:
8 (a) Is alive when the proceeding is commenced; and
9 (b) Claims to be a de facto parent of the child.
10 2. A person who claims to be a de facto parent of a child must
11 commence a proceeding to establish parentage of a child under
12 this section:
13 (a) Before the child attains 18 years of age; and
14 (b) While the child is alive.
15 3. The following rules govern standing of a person who

22 to the proceeding.
23 (b) An adverse party, parent or legal guardian may file a
24 pleading in response to the pleading filed under paragraph (a). A

40 by clear and convincing evidence that:

11 child is in the best interest of the child.
12 5. Subject to other limitations in sections 73 to 80, inclusive,
13 of this act, if in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of a person
14 who claims to be a de facto parent of the child, there is more than
15 one other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of
16 the child and the court determines that the requirements of
17 subsection 4 are satisfied, the court shall adjudicate parentage
18 under section 80 of this act.
19 Sec. 77. 1. If a child has an acknowledged parent, a
20 proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment of parentage or a

29 (a) The person must commence the proceeding not later than 2
30 years after the effective date of the acknowledgment.
31 (b) The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds
32 permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child.

37 was a party to the adjudication or received notice under section 70
38 of this act, is governed by the rules governing a collateral attack
39 on a judgment.
40 2. If a child has an adjudicated parent, the following rules
41 apply to a proceeding to challenge the adjudication of parentage
42 brought by a person, other than the child, who has standing under
43 section 69 of this act and was not a party to the adjudication and
44 did not receive notice under section 70 of this act:

8 126.810, inclusive, and sections 91 and 92 of this act or the person
9 who gave birth to the child may bring a proceeding to adjudicate

12 act, the court shall adjudicate the person to be a parent of the
13 child.
14 2. In a proceeding to adjudicate a person’s parentage of a
15 child, if another person other than the person who gave birth to
16 the child is a parent under NRS 126.500 to 126.810, inclusive, and
17 sections 91 and 92 of this act, the court shall adjudicate the
18 person’s parentage of the child under section 80 of this act.

21 section 77 or 78 of this act, to parentage of a child by two or more
22 persons, the court shall adjudicate parentage in the best interest of
23 the child, based on:
24 (a) The age of the child;

26 role of parent of the child;
27 (c) The nature of the relationship between the child and each
28 person;

37 genetic testing, in addition to the factors listed in subsection 1, the
38 court shall consider:
39 (a) The facts surrounding the discovery the person might not
40 be a genetic parent of the child; and
41 (b) The length of time between the time that the person was
42 placed on notice that the person might not be a genetic parent and

45 parents under sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act if the court
-
*AB424*
– 24 –
1 finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be
2 detrimental to the child. A finding of detriment to the child does
3 not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person seeking
4 an adjudication of parentage. In determining detriment to the
5 child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the
6 harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with a person
7 who has fulfilled the child’s physical needs and psychological
8 needs for care and affection and has assumed the role for a
9 substantial period.
10 Sec. 81. 1. In a proceeding under sections 68 to 88,

27 Sec. 82. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
28 the court may combine a proceeding to adjudicate parentage

9 without a jury.
10 Sec. 86. The court may dismiss a proceeding under sections
11 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act for want of prosecution only without

14 dismissal without prejudice.

16 the child in a manner provided by law of this State other than
17 sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act.

42 court shall order the State Registrar of Vital Statistics to issue an
43 amended birth certificate.

-

26 order:
27 (a) Expressly identifies the child as a “child of the marriage”
28 or “issue of the marriage” or includes similar words indicating
29 that both spouses are parents of the child; or
30 (b) Provides for support of the child by a spouse or domestic
31 partner unless that spouse’s or domestic partner’s parentage of
32 the child is disclaimed specifically in the order.
33 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 or section 78
34 of this act, a determination of parentage may be asserted as a
35 defense in a subsequent proceeding seeking to adjudicate
36 parentage of a person who was not a party to the earlier
37 proceeding.

13 2. If a person who consented in a record to assisted

32 unless:
33 (a) The agreement provides otherwise; and
34 (b) The transfer of a gamete or embryo occurs not later than
35 36 months after the death of the intended parent or birth of the

43 transfer.
44 2. Unless a gestational agreement provides otherwise, on
45 termination of the agreement under subsection 1, the parties are

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing parentage and the establishment of
2 parent and child relationships. (Chapter 126 of NRS) Sections 29-90 of this bill
3 generally replace such provisions with provisions modeled after those of the
4 Uniform Parentage Act (hereinafter “UPA”), adopted by the Uniform Law
5 Commission in 2017. Sections 4-27 of this bill define terms for the purposes of
6 chapter 126 of NRS that are modeled after the definitions of the terms used in the
7 UPA.
8 Existing law provides the manner in which the legal relationship of a mother
9 and child can be established, including: (1) except in the case of a gestational
10 agreement, proof that a woman gave birth to a child; (2) an adjudication that a
11 woman is the mother of a child; (3) proof that a woman has adopted a child; (4) an
12 unrebutted presumption of a woman’s maternity; (5) the consent of a woman to
13 assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; or (6) an adjudication
14 confirming a woman as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier. (NRS
15 126.041) Existing law also provides the manner in which the legal relationship of a
16 father and child can be established, including: (1) an adjudication that a man is the
17 father of a child; (2) proof that a man has adopted a child; (3) the consent of a man
18 to assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; (4) an adjudication
19 confirming a man as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier; (5) a
20 presumption of paternity that arises if a man was married to or cohabitating with
21 the natural mother of a child or resides with and holds out a child as his natural
22 child; (6) genetic testing establishing a man as the father of a child; or (7) a
23 voluntary acknowledgment of paternity by a man. (NRS 126.041, 126.051,
24 126.053) Section 35 uses the gender-neutral language of the UPA to set forth the
25 circumstances in which a parent and child relationship is established between a
26 person and a child. Similarly, section 38 uses the gender-neutral language of the
27 UPA to establish the circumstances in which a person is presumed to be a parent of
28 a child.
29 Sections 39-52 establish provisions modeled after those of the UPA relating to
30 the voluntary acknowledgment or voluntary denial of parentage by certain persons,
31 including provisions relating to the requirement for, rescission of and challenge to
32 an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage. Section 43 provides that,
33 unless an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage is rescinded or
34 challenged, such an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage that meets
35 all requirements of law and is filed with the State Registrar of Vital Statistics is
36 equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a child or the nonparentage of a
37 person, respectively. Section 44 prohibits the State Registrar of Vital Statistics
38 from charging a fee for filing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
39 parentage, and section 52 authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt any
40 necessary regulations relating to an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
41 parentage.
42 Existing law provides that in an action to determine paternity, a court is
43 authorized or required depending on the circumstances, to order genetic testing of a
44 mother, child, alleged father or any other person. (NRS 126.121) Sections 53-67
45 establish various provisions modeled after those of the UPA concerning genetic
46 testing, including: (1) the limitation on the use of genetic testing; (2) the authority
47 to order, facilitate or deny genetic testing; (3) the requirements of genetic testing;
48 (4) reports and costs of genetic testing; (5) additional genetic testing when a result
49 is contested; (6) genetic testing when a specimen is not available from an alleged
50 genetic parent; and (7) genetic testing of a deceased person or identical sibling.
51 Section 67 provides that a person commits a misdemeanor, if without proper
52 authority, he or she intentionally releases an identifiable specimen of another
53 person collected for genetic testing for a purpose not relevant to a proceeding
54 regarding parentage.

55 Existing law establishes various provisions relating to an action to determine
56 paternity or maternity. (NRS 126.071-126.231) Sections 68-88 replace several of
57 those provisions with provisions modeled after those of the UPA governing
58 proceedings to adjudicate parentage. Existing law provides that if an action to
59 determine paternity is brought before the birth of a child, all proceedings are
60 generally required to be stayed until after the birth of the child. (NRS 126.071)
61 Section 83 instead authorizes a proceeding to adjudicate parentage to be
62 commenced, and an order or judgment to be entered before the birth of a child, but
63 requires enforcement of the order or judgment to be stayed until after the birth of
64 the child.
65 Existing law does not bar an action to determine paternity until 3 years after the
66 child reaches the age of majority. (NRS 126.081) Sections 74 and 75 instead
67 provide that a proceeding to determine whether an alleged genetic parent or
68 presumed parent, respectively, is a parent of a child may be commenced after the
69 child becomes an adult if the child initiates the proceeding.
70 Existing law requires that an informal hearing be held after an action to
71 determine paternity has been brought and further requires a court to attempt to
72 resolve the issues raised in the action during the pretrial hearing. (NRS 126.111)
73 Section 139 of this bill repeals the provisions relating to such a pretrial hearing, as
74 the UPA does not require any such pretrial hearing to be conducted.
75 Section 76 authorizes a person who claims to be a de facto parent of a child to
76 commence a proceeding to establish parentage of the child if the child is alive and
77 less than 18 years of age. Section 76 provides that a person who claims to be a de
78 facto parent of a child must be adjudicated as a parent of the child if there is only
79 one other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child and the
80 person who claims to be a de facto parent can demonstrate certain facts by clear and
81 convincing evidence. Section 80 authorizes a court to adjudicate a child to have
82 more than two parents if the court finds that failure to recognize more than two
83 parents would be detrimental to the child.
84 Existing law establishes provisions concerning assisted reproduction and
85 gestational surrogacy. (NRS 126.500-126.810) This bill establishes only certain
86 provisions modeled after those of the UPA relating to such matters. Section 91 of
87 this bill establishes provisions relating to the parental status of certain persons who
88 die before a child is conceived by assisted reproduction. Section 92 of this bill
89 authorizes a party to a gestational agreement to terminate the agreement at any time
90 before an embryo transfer or, if an embryo transfer does not result in pregnancy, at
91 any time before a subsequent embryo transfer.
92 Existing law requires a gestational agreement to provide for the express written
93 agreement of the gestational carrier to undergo embryo or gamete transfer and
94 attempt to carry and give birth to any resulting child. (NRS 126.750) Section 107
95 of this bill requires a gestational agreement to also provide for the express written
96 agreement of the gestational carrier and any legal spouse or domestic partner of the
97 gestational carrier to acknowledge that each intended parent is the legal and
98 physical custodian of any resulting child. Section 107 also specifies that a
99 gestational carrier has the right to make all health and welfare decisions regarding
100 the gestational carrier and the pregnancy of the gestational carrier, including
101 whether to: (1) consent to a cesarean section or the transfer of multiple embryos;
102 (2) use the services of a health care practitioner chosen by the gestational carrier;
103 (3) terminate or continue the pregnancy; and (4) reduce or retain the number of
104 fetuses or embryos carried by the gestational carrier. Section 107 further provides
105 that any provision in a gestational agreement that contradicts such a right is void
106 and unenforceable.
107 Existing law provides that the subsequent marriage or domestic partnership of a
108 gestational carrier after the execution of a gestational agreement does not affect the
109 validity of the agreement. (NRS 126.770) Section 108 of this bill provides that the
-
*AB424*

– 4 –
110 subsequent marriage, domestic partnership or divorce of any party to a gestational
111 agreement does not affect the validity of the agreement unless the agreement
112 expressly provides otherwise.
113 Existing law provides that if a gestational carrier breaches a gestational
114 agreement, a specific performance remedy that would require the gestational carrier
115 to be impregnated is prohibited. (NRS 126.780) Section 109 of this bill instead
116 provides that specific performance is not an available remedy with regard to a
117 gestational agreement except to enforce any provision in the agreement that is
118 necessary to enable the intended parents to exercise the full rights of parentage
119 immediately upon the birth of the child, if the intended parents are being prevented
120 from exercising such rights.
121 Sections 98-106 of this bill make various other changes to the provisions of
122 existing law concerning assisted reproduction and gestational surrogacy.
123 Section 139 repeals provisions of existing law that are not necessary because
124 of the establishment of the provisions modeled after those of the UPA in
125 sections 29-90.
126 Sections 1, 93-97, 110-136 and 139 of this bill make conforming changes to
127 reflect the revisions made to existing law because of the establishment of the
128 provisions modeled after those of the UPA in sections 29-90 and the repeal of
129 unnecessary provisions in section 139.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

2 the objecting person or child support agency may request the court
3 to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index
4 using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the
5 laboratory.
6 (b) The person or the child support agency objecting to the
7 laboratory’s choice under this subsection shall:
8 (1) If the requested frequencies are not available to the
9 laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the
10 requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by
11 accrediting bodies; or
12 (2) Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.
13 (c) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there
14 is a question which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The
15 laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if
16 available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.
17 4. If, after recalculation of the relationship index under
18 subsection 3 using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic
19 testing under section 61 of this act does not identify a person as a
20 genetic parent of a child, the court may require a person who has
21 been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a
22 genetic parent.
23 Sec. 60. 1. A report of genetic testing must be in a record
24 and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing
25 laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of sections
26 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act is self-authenticating.
27 2. Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following
28 information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody
29 and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without
30 testimony:
31 (a) The name and photograph of each person whose specimen
32 has been taken;
33 (b) The name of the person who collected each specimen;
34 (c) The place and date each specimen was collected;
35 (d) The name of the person who received each specimen in the
36 testing laboratory; and
37 (e) The date each specimen was received.
38 Sec. 61. 1. Subject to a challenge under subsection 2, a
39 person is identified under sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act as
40 a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with sections
41 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act and the results of the testing
42 disclose:
43 (a) The person has at least a 99-percent probability of
44 parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using
45 the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and
-
*AB424*

– 16 –
1 (b) A combined relationship index of at least 100 to 1.
2 2. A person identified under subsection 1 as a genetic parent
3 of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other
4 genetic testing satisfying the requirements of sections 53 to 67,
5 inclusive, of this act which:
6 (a) Excludes the person as a genetic parent of the child; or
7 (b) Identifies another person as a possible genetic parent of the
8 child other than:
9 (1) The person who gave birth to the child; or
10 (2) The person identified under subsection 1.
11 3. Except as otherwise provided in section 66 of this act, if
12 more than one person other than the person who gave birth to the
13 child is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of
14 the child, the court shall order each person to submit to further
15 genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.
16 4. As used in this section:
17 (a) “Combined relationship index” means the product of all
18 tested relationship indices.
19 (b) “Probability of parentage” means, for the ethnic or racial
20 group to which a person alleged to be a parent belongs, the
21 probability that a hypothesized genetic relationship is supported,
22 compared to the probability that a genetic relationship is
23 supported between the child and a random person of the ethnic or
24 racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship,
25 expressed as a percentage incorporating the combined
26 relationship index and a prior probability.
27 Sec. 62. 1. Subject to assessment of fees under sections 68
28 to 88, inclusive, of this act, payment of the cost of initial genetic
29 testing must be made in advance:
30 (a) By the person who made the request for genetic testing;
31 (b) As agreed by the parties; or
32 (c) As ordered by the court.
33 2. If the cost of genetic testing is paid by a child support
34 agency, the agency may seek reimbursement from the genetic
35 parent whose parent and child relationship is established.
36 Sec. 63. The court shall order, or a child support agency may
37 facilitate, additional genetic testing on request of a person who
38 contests the result of the initial testing under section 61 of this act.
39 If initial genetic testing under section 61 of this act identified a
40 person as a genetic parent of the child, the court may not order,
41 and a child support agency may not facilitate, additional testing
42 unless the contesting person pays for the testing in advance.
43 Sec. 64. 1. Subject to subsection 2, if a genetic-testing
44 specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a
45 child, a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause
-
*AB424*

– 17 –
1 and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may
2 order any of the following persons to submit specimens for genetic
3 testing:
4 (a) A parent of the alleged genetic parent;
5 (b) A sibling of the alleged genetic parent;
6 (c) Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the person
7 who gave birth to the other child; and
8 (d) Another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to
9 complete genetic testing.
10 2. To issue an order under this section, the court must find
11 that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of
12 the person sought to be tested.
13 Sec. 65. If a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates
14 good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased
15 person.
16 Sec. 66. 1. If the court finds there is reason to believe that
17 an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence
18 that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may
19 order genetic testing of the sibling.
20 2. If more than one sibling is identified under section 61 of
21 this act as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on
22 nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent
23 of the child.
24 Sec. 67. 1. Release of a report of genetic testing for
25 parentage is controlled by law of this State other than sections 29
26 to 90, inclusive, of this act.
27 2. A person who intentionally releases an identifiable
28 specimen of another person collected for genetic testing under
29 sections 53 to 67, inclusive, of this act for a purpose not relevant to
30 a proceeding regarding parentage, without a court order or written
31 permission of the person who furnished the specimen, is guilty of
32 a misdemeanor.
33 Sec. 68. 1. A proceeding may be commenced to adjudicate
34 the parentage of a child. Except as otherwise provided in sections
35 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act, the proceeding is governed by the
36 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.
37 2. A proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child born
38 under a gestational agreement is governed by NRS 126.500 to
39 126.810, inclusive, and sections 91 and 92 of this act.
40 3. As used in this section, “gestational agreement” has the
41 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 126.570.
42 Sec. 69. Except as otherwise provided in sections 39 to 52,
43 inclusive, and 75 to 78, inclusive, of this act, a proceeding to
44 adjudicate parentage may be maintained by:
45 1. The child;
-
*AB424*

– 18 –
1 2. The person who gave birth to the child, unless a court has
2 adjudicated that the person who gave birth to the child is not a
3 parent;
4 3. A person who is a parent under sections 29 to 90, inclusive,
5 of this act;
6 4. A person whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated;
7 5. A child support agency or other governmental agency
8 authorized by law of this State other than sections 29 to 90,
9 inclusive, of this act;
10 6. An adoption agency authorized by law of this State other
11 than sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act or licensed child-
12 placing agency;
13 7. A representative authorized by law of this State other than
14 sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act to act for a person who
15 otherwise would be entitled to maintain a proceeding but is
16 deceased, incapacitated or a minor; or
17 8. An agency which provides child welfare services in a
18 proceeding pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS.
19 Sec. 70. 1. The petitioner shall give notice of a proceeding
20 to adjudicate parentage to the following persons, if the
21 whereabouts of the person are known:
22 (a) The person who gave birth to the child, unless a court has
23 adjudicated that the person who gave birth to the child is not a
24 parent;
25 (b) A person who is a parent of the child under sections 29 to
26 90, inclusive, of this act;
27 (c) A presumed, acknowledged or adjudicated parent of the
28 child; and
29 (d) A person whose parentage of the child is to be adjudicated.
30 2. A person entitled to notice under subsection 1 has a right
31 to intervene in the proceeding.
32 3. Lack of notice required by subsection 1 does not render a
33 judgment void. Lack of notice does not preclude a person entitled
34 to notice under subsection 1 from bringing a proceeding under
35 subsection 2 of section 78 of this act.
36 Sec. 71. 1. The court may adjudicate a person’s parentage
37 of a child only if the court has personal jurisdiction over the
38 person.
39 2. A court of this State with jurisdiction to adjudicate
40 parentage may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident if
41 the conditions prescribed in NRS 130.201 are satisfied.
42 3. Lack of jurisdiction over one person does not preclude the
43 court from making an adjudication of parentage binding on
44 another person.

1 Sec. 72. Venue for a proceeding to adjudicate parentage is in
2 the county of this State in which:
3 1. The child resides or is located;
4 2. If the child does not reside in this State, the respondent
5 resides or is located;
6 3. A proceeding has been commenced for administration of
7 the estate of a person who is or may be a parent under sections 29
8 to 90, inclusive, of this act; or
9 4. A proceeding has been commenced to protect a child from
10 abuse or neglect pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS.
11 Sec. 73. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 of
12 section 57 of this act, the court shall admit a report of genetic
13 testing ordered by the court under section 58 of this act as
14 evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the report.
15 2. A party may object to the admission of a report described
16 in subsection 1, not later than 14 days after the party receives the
17 report. The party shall cite specific grounds for exclusion.
18 3. A party that objects to the results of genetic testing may
19 call a genetic-testing expert to testify in person or by another
20 method approved by the court. Unless the court orders otherwise,
21 the party offering the testimony bears the expense for the expert
22 testifying.
23 4. Admissibility of a report of genetic testing is not affected by
24 whether the testing was performed:
25 (a) Voluntarily, under an order of the court or as a result of
26 the facilitation of a child support agency; or
27 (b) Before, on or after commencement of the proceeding.
28 Sec. 74. 1. A proceeding to determine whether an alleged
29 genetic parent who is not a presumed parent is a parent of a child
30 may be commenced:
31 (a) Before the child becomes an adult; or
32 (b) After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child
33 initiates the proceeding.
34 2. This subsection applies in a proceeding described in
35 subsection 1 if the person who gave birth to the child is the only
36 other person with a claim to parentage of the child. The court
37 shall adjudicate an alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the
38 child if the alleged genetic parent:
39 (a) Is identified under section 61 of this act as a genetic parent
40 of the child and the identification is not successfully challenged
41 under section 61 of this act;
42 (b) Admits parentage in a pleading, when making an
43 appearance or during a hearing, the court accepts the admission
44 and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent
45 of the child;
-
*AB424*

– 20 –
1 (c) Declines to submit to genetic testing ordered by the court or
2 facilitated by a child support agency, in which case the court may
3 adjudicate the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child
4 even if the alleged genetic parent denies a genetic relationship
5 with the child;
6 (d) Is in default after service of process and the court
7 determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child;
8 or
9 (e) Is neither identified nor excluded as a genetic parent by
10 genetic testing and, based on other evidence, the court determines
11 the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child.
12 3. Subject to other limitations in sections 73 to 80, inclusive,
13 of this act, if in a proceeding involving an alleged genetic parent,
14 at least one other person in addition to the person who gave birth
15 to the child has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall
16 adjudicate parentage under section 80 of this act.

21 initiates the proceeding.
22 2. A presumption of parentage under section 38 of this act
23 cannot be overcome after the child attains 2 years of age unless
24 the court determines:
25 (a) The presumed parent is not a genetic parent, never resided
26 with the child and never held out the child as the presumed
27 parent’s child; or
28 (b) The child has more than one presumed parent.
29 3. The following rules apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a
30 presumed parent’s parentage of a child if the person who gave
31 birth to the child is the only other person with a claim to parentage
32 of the child:
33 (a) If there is not a party to the proceeding who challenges the
34 presumed parent’s parentage of the child, the court shall
35 adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child.
36 (b) If the presumed parent is identified under section 61 of this
37 act as a genetic parent of the child and that identification is not
38 successfully challenged under section 61 of this act, the court
39 shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child.
40 (c) If the presumed parent is not identified under section 61 of
41 this act as a genetic parent of the child and the presumed parent
42 or the person who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed
43 parent’s parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the
44 parentage of the child in the best interest of the child based on the
45 factors under subsections 1 and 2 of section 80 of this act.

*AB424*

– 21 –
1 4. Subject to other limitations in sections 73 to 80, inclusive,
2 of this act, if in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent’s
3 parentage of a child, another person in addition to the person who
4 gave birth to the child asserts a claim to parentage of the child, the
5 court shall adjudicate parentage under section 80 of this act.
6 Sec. 76. 1. A proceeding to establish parentage of a child
7 under this section may be commenced only by a person who:
8 (a) Is alive when the proceeding is commenced; and
9 (b) Claims to be a de facto parent of the child.
10 2. A person who claims to be a de facto parent of a child must
11 commence a proceeding to establish parentage of a child under
12 this section:
13 (a) Before the child attains 18 years of age; and
14 (b) While the child is alive.
15 3. The following rules govern standing of a person who
16 claims to be a de facto parent of a child to maintain a proceeding
17 under this section:
18 (a) The person must file an initial verified pleading alleging
19 specific facts that support the claim to parentage of the child
20 asserted under this section. The verified pleading must be served
21 on all parents and legal guardians of the child and any other party
22 to the proceeding.
23 (b) An adverse party, parent or legal guardian may file a
24 pleading in response to the pleading filed under paragraph (a). A
25 responsive pleading must be verified and must be served on parties
26 to the proceeding.
27 (c) Unless the court finds a hearing is necessary to determine
28 disputed facts material to the issue of standing, the court shall
29 determine, based on the pleadings under paragraphs (a) and (b),
30 whether the person has alleged facts sufficient to satisfy by a
31 preponderance of the evidence the requirements of paragraphs (a)
32 to (g), inclusive, of subsection 4. If the court holds a hearing
33 under this subsection, the hearing must be held on an expedited
34 basis.
35 4. In a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of a person who
36 claims to be a de facto parent of the child, if there is only one
37 other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the
38 child, the court shall adjudicate the person who claims to be a de

40 by clear and convincing evidence that:
41 (a) The person resided with the child as a regular member of
42 the child’s household for a significant period;
43 (b) The person engaged in consistent caretaking of the child;
-
*AB424*

– 22 –
1 (c) The person undertook full and permanent responsibilities
2 of a parent of the child without expectation of financial
3 compensation;
4 (d) The person held out the child as the person’s child;
5 (e) The person established a bonded and dependent
6 relationship with the child which is parental in nature;
7 (f) Another parent of the child fostered or supported the

10 (g) Continuing the relationship between the person and the
11 child is in the best interest of the child.
12 5. Subject to other limitations in sections 73 to 80, inclusive,
13 of this act, if in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage of a person
14 who claims to be a de facto parent of the child, there is more than
15 one other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of
16 the child and the court determines that the requirements of
17 subsection 4 are satisfied, the court shall adjudicate parentage
18 under section 80 of this act.
19 Sec. 77. 1. If a child has an acknowledged parent, a
20 proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment of parentage or a
21 denial of parentage, brought by a signatory to the
22 acknowledgment or denial, is governed by sections 47 and 48 of
23 this act.
24 2. If a child has an acknowledged parent, the following rules

28 was not a signatory to the acknowledgment or denial:
29 (a) The person must commence the proceeding not later than 2
30 years after the effective date of the acknowledgment.
31 (b) The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds
32 permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child.
33 (c) If the court permits the proceeding, the court shall
34 adjudicate parentage under section 79 of this act.
35 Sec. 78. 1. If a child has an adjudicated parent, a
36 proceeding to challenge the adjudication, brought by a person who
37 was a party to the adjudication or received notice under section 70
38 of this act, is governed by the rules governing a collateral attack
39 on a judgment.
40 2. If a child has an adjudicated parent, the following rules
41 apply to a proceeding to challenge the adjudication of parentage
42 brought by a person, other than the child, who has standing under

44 did not receive notice under section 70 of this act:
-
*AB424*

– 23 –
1 (a) The person must commence the proceeding not later than 2
2 years after the effective date of the adjudication.
3 (b) The court may permit the proceeding only if the court finds
4 permitting the proceeding is in the best interest of the child.
5 (c) If the court permits the proceeding, the court shall
6 adjudicate parentage under section 80 of this act.
7 Sec. 79. 1. A person who is a parent under NRS 126.500 to
8 126.810, inclusive, and sections 91 and 92 of this act or the person
9 who gave birth to the child may bring a proceeding to adjudicate
10 parentage. If the court determines the person is a parent under
11 NRS 126.500 to 126.810, inclusive, and sections 91 and 92 of this
12 act, the court shall adjudicate the person to be a parent of the
13 child.
14 2. In a proceeding to adjudicate a person’s parentage of a
15 child, if another person other than the person who gave birth to
16 the child is a parent under NRS 126.500 to 126.810, inclusive, and
17 sections 91 and 92 of this act, the court shall adjudicate the
18 person’s parentage of the child under section 80 of this act.
19 Sec. 80. 1. In a proceeding to adjudicate competing claims
20 of, or challenges under subsection 3 of section 75 of this act or
21 section 77 or 78 of this act, to parentage of a child by two or more
22 persons, the court shall adjudicate parentage in the best interest of
23 the child, based on:
24 (a) The age of the child;
25 (b) The length of time during which each person assumed the
26 role of parent of the child;
27 (c) The nature of the relationship between the child and each
28 person;
29 (d) The harm to the child if the relationship between the child
30 and each person is not recognized;
31 (e) The basis for each person’s claim to parentage of the child;

35 other harm to the child.
36 2. If a person challenges parentage based on the results of
37 genetic testing, in addition to the factors listed in subsection 1, the
38 court shall consider:
39 (a) The facts surrounding the discovery the person might not
40 be a genetic parent of the child; and
41 (b) The length of time between the time that the person was

45 parents under sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act if the court
-
*AB424*

– 24 –
1 finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be
2 detrimental to the child. A finding of detriment to the child does
3 not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person seeking
4 an adjudication of parentage. In determining detriment to the
5 child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the
6 harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with a person
7 who has fulfilled the child’s physical needs and psychological
8 needs for care and affection and has assumed the role for a
9 substantial period.
10 Sec. 81. 1. In a proceeding under sections 68 to 88,
11 inclusive, of this act, the court may issue a temporary order for
12 child support if the order is consistent with the law of this State

25 visitation under law of this State other than sections 29 to 90,
26 inclusive, of this act.
27 Sec. 82. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
28 the court may combine a proceeding to adjudicate parentage
29 under sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act with a proceeding for
30 adoption, termination of parental rights, protection of a child from
31 abuse or neglect pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS, child custody
32 or visitation, child support, divorce, dissolution, annulment,
33 declaration of invalidity, legal separation or separate
34 maintenance, administration of an estate or other appropriate
35 proceeding.
36 2. A respondent may not combine a proceeding described in
37 subsection 1 with a proceeding to adjudicate parentage brought
38 under NRS 130.0902 to 130.802, inclusive.

42 child and an order or judgment may be entered before birth, but
43 enforcement of the order or judgment must be stayed until the
44 birth of the child.

1 Sec. 84. 1. A minor child is a permissive party but not a
2 necessary party to a proceeding under sections 68 to 88, inclusive,
3 of this act.
4 2. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent a
5 child in a proceeding under sections 68 to 88, inclusive, of this act
6 if the court finds that the interests of the child are not adequately
7 represented.
8 Sec. 85. The court shall adjudicate parentage of a child
9 without a jury.
10 Sec. 86. The court may dismiss a proceeding under sections
11 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act for want of prosecution only without
12 prejudice. An order of dismissal for want of prosecution
13 purportedly with prejudice is void and has only the effect of a
14 dismissal without prejudice.
15 Sec. 87. 1. An order adjudicating parentage must identify
16 the child in a manner provided by law of this State other than
17 sections 29 to 90, inclusive, of this act.
18 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the court
19 may assess filing fees, reasonable attorney’s fees, fees for genetic
20 testing, other costs and necessary travel and other reasonable
21 expenses incurred in a proceeding under sections 68 to 88,
