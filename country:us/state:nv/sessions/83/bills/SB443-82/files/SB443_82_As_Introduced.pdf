Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
2 computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS
3 293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
4 such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
5 the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
6 Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
7 during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
8 periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
9 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
10 card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
11 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847) Sections 1.6 and 2 of
12 this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person during the period for early

13 voting or on election day, an elector must, with certain exceptions, provide a
14 current and valid driver’s license or identification card issued by this State, another
15 state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the United States or provide a tribal
16 identification card as proof of identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or
17 identification card was issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the
18 elector’s current residential address, the driver’s license or identification card is
19 also proof of the elector’s residency. If the elector’s tribal identification card shows
20 the elector’s current residential address, the tribal identification card is also proof of
21 the elector’s residency.
22 If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was not issued by the
23 Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she
24 completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot
25 must provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification card issued by the
26 Department of Motor Vehicles, an interim document issued by the Department of
27 Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
28 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
29 Sections 1.6 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
30 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the
31 elector’s current residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic
32 or certified copy of a document as proof of residency and that, for certain
33 documents, such document must be dated not more than 60 days before the date the
34 elector is registering to vote.
35 Sections 1.6 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s
36 license or identification card issued by this State or another state, the District of
37 Columbia or any territory of the United States or a tribal identification card, the
38 elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation.
39 Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current and valid
40 driver’s license, identification card or interim document issued by the Department
41 of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of identity and
42 residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
43 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to
44 arrange for extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county
45 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark County and Washoe
46 County). (NRS 481.057) Section 3 of this bill provides that, in a county whose
47 population is 100,000 or more, the Director is required to arrange for the offices of
48 the Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at hours other than 8
49 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any type of
50 driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2
51 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary
52 election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during
53 the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
54 presidential preference primary election or general election. Section 3 further
55 prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county whose population is 100,000
56 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the issuance or renewal of
57 any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1)
58 during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail
59 for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election;
60 and (2) during the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary
61 election, presidential preference primary election or general election.
62 Section 3.5 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State Highway Fund to
63 the Department of Motor Vehicles for the costs of additional security services for
64 the extended hours of operation required by section 3.
