AN ACT relating to contractors; revising provisions exempting
certain work from the provisions governing the licensure
and regulation of contractors; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors. (Chapter
2 624 of NRS) Existing law also provides that the provisions of existing law
3 governing the licensure and regulation of contractors do not apply to any work to
4 repair or maintain property, the value of which is less than $1,000, including labor
5 and materials, unless certain circumstances exist. (NRS 624.031) This bill increases
6 that monetary threshold to $5,000 and excludes the value of materials from that
7 threshold.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 624.031 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 624.031 The provisions of this chapter do not apply to:
3 1. Work performed exclusively by an authorized representative

5 incorporated city, county, irrigation district, reclamation district, or
6 other municipal or political corporation or subdivision of this State.
7 2. Any entity that is recognized as exempt under section
8 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3),

– 2 –
1 (a) Enters into a contract or other agreement with the State of
2 Nevada, or an incorporated city, county, irrigation district,
3 reclamation district, or other municipal or political corporation or

5 properties, including, without limitation, weatherization and energy
6 efficiency services;
7 (b) Facilitates work to be performed on such a property by a
8 person licensed pursuant to this chapter; and

19 residential structure on the property for his or her own occupancy
20 and not intended for sale or lease. The sale or lease, or the offering
21 for sale or lease, of the newly built structure within 1 year after its
22 completion creates a rebuttable presumption for the purposes of this
23 section that the building of the structure was performed with the
24 intent to sell or lease that structure. An owner of property who
25 requests an exemption pursuant to this subsection must apply to the
26 Board for the exemption. The Board shall adopt regulations setting
27 forth the requirements for granting the exemption.

38 (1) The value of which is $500 or more; or
39 (2) For which contracts of less than $500 have been awarded
40 to evade the provisions of this chapter; or
41 (e) The work is performed by a person who is licensed pursuant
42 to this chapter or by an employee of that person.

2 personal property.
3 9. The construction, alteration, improvement or repair financed
4 in whole or in part by the Federal Government and conducted within

17 qualified person incurs in providing construction oversight services
18 to that group. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,

29 abilities, education, experience, knowledge, skills and training that a
30 long-term recovery group has identified as being necessary to
31 provide construction oversight services for a project to be performed
32 by that group.
33 12. A person licensed as a real estate broker, real estate broker-
34 salesperson or real estate salesperson pursuant to chapter 645 of
