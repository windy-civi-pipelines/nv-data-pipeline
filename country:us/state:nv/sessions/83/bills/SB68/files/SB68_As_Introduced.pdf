8 1. The Licensee shall immediately apply for the reissuance
9 of their Multistate License in their new Home State. The Licensee
10 shall pay all applicable fees and notify the prior Home State in

13 License, the new Home State shall verify that the Multistate
14 License is active, unencumbered and eligible for reissuance under
15 the terms of the Compact and the Rules of the Commission. The
16 Multistate License issued by the prior Home State will be
17 deactivated and all Member States notified in accordance with the
18 applicable Rules adopted by the Commission.
19 3. Prior to the reissuance of the Multistate License, the new
20 Home State shall conduct procedures for considering the criminal
21 history records of the Licensee. Such procedures shall include the
22 submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information
23 by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant’s criminal
24 history record information from the Federal Bureau of
25 Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that State’s
26 criminal records.
27 4. If required for initial licensure, the new Home State may
28 require completion of jurisprudence requirements in the new

30 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Compact, if
31 a Licensee does not meet the requirements set forth in this
32 Compact for the reissuance of a Multistate License by the new
33 Home State, then the Licensee shall be subject to the new Home
34 State requirements for the issuance of a Single State License in
35 that State.
36 C. If a Licensee changes their primary State of residence by
37 moving from a Member State to a non-Member State, or from a
38 non-Member State to a Member State, then the Licensee shall be
39 subject to the State requirements for the issuance of a Single State
40 License in the new Home State.
41 D. Nothing in this Compact shall interfere with a Licensee’s
42 ability to hold a Single State License in multiple States; however,
43 for the purposes of this Compact, a Licensee shall have only one
44 Home State and only one Multistate License.

16 State due process law, to:
17 1. Take Adverse Action against a Regulated Social
18 Worker’s Multistate Authorization to Practice only within that
19 Member State, and issue subpoenas for both hearings and
20 investigations that require the attendance and testimony of
21 witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued
22 by a Licensing Authority in a Member State for the attendance
23 and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from
24 another Member State shall be enforced in the latter State by any
25 court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and
26 procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in
27 proceedings pending before it. The issuing Licensing Authority
28 shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees
29 required by the service statutes of the State in which the witnesses
30 or evidence are located.
31 2. Only the Home State shall have the power to take
32 Adverse Action against a Regulated Social Worker’s Multistate
33 License.
34 B. For purposes of taking Adverse Action, the Home State
35 shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received
36 from a Member State as it would if the conduct had occurred
37 within the Home State. In so doing, the Home State shall apply its
38 own State laws to determine appropriate action.
39 C. The Home State shall complete any pending investigations
40 of a Regulated Social Worker who changes their Home State
41 during the course of the investigations. The Home State shall also
42 have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly
43 report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of
44 the Data System. The administrator of the Data System shall
45 promptly notify the new Home State of any Adverse Actions.
-
*SB68*

– 15 –

2 recover from the affected Regulated Social Worker the costs of
3 investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any Adverse
4 Action taken against that Regulated Social Worker.
5 E. A Member State may take Adverse Action based on the
6 factual findings of another Member State, provided that the
7 Member State follows its own procedures for taking the Adverse
8 Action.
9 F. Joint Investigations:
10 1. In addition to the authority granted to a Member State by
11 its respective Social Work practice act or other applicable State
12 law, any Member State may participate with other Member States
13 in joint investigations of Licensees.
14 2. Member States shall share any investigative, litigation, or
15 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual
16 investigation initiated under the Compact.
17 G. If Adverse Action is taken by the Home State against the
18 Multistate License of a Regulated Social Worker, the Regulated
19 Social Worker’s Multistate Authorization to Practice in all other
20 Member States shall be deactivated until all Encumbrances have
21 been removed from the Multistate License. All Home State
22 disciplinary orders that impose Adverse Action against the license
23 of a Regulated Social Worker shall include a statement that the
24 Regulated Social Worker’s Multistate Authorization to Practice is
25 deactivated in all Member States until all conditions of the
26 decision, order or agreement are satisfied.
27 H. If a Member State takes Adverse Action, it shall promptly
28 notify the administrator of the Data System. The administrator of
29 the Data System shall promptly notify the Home State and all
30 other Member States of any Adverse Actions by Remote States.
31 I. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Member State’s
32 decision that participation in an Alternative Program may be used
33 in lieu of Adverse Action.
34 J. Nothing in this Compact shall authorize a Member State to
35 demand the issuance of subpoenas for attendance and testimony
36 of witnesses or the production of evidence from another Member
37 State for lawful actions within that Member State.
38 K. Nothing in this Compact shall authorize a Member State
39 to impose discipline against a Regulated Social Worker who holds
40 a Multistate Authorization to Practice for lawful actions within
41 another Member State.

9 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section
10 12.L, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than 30 days
11 after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
12 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the
13 Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 48
14 hours’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the
15 usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this
16 section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as
17 reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
18 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision,
19 an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in
20 order to:
21 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
22 welfare;
23 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
24 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
25 established by federal law or rule; or
26 4. Protect public health and safety.
27 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the
28 Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for
29 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
30 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
31 revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
32 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of
33 thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
34 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a
35 Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
36 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge
37 is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
38 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
39 approval of the Commission.
40 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply
41 under this Compact.

1 SECTION 13: OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE
2 RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT
3
4 A. Oversight:
5 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government
6 in each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all
7 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
8 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is
9 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission
10 shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
11 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is
12 located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
13 defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
14 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall
15 affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action
16 against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or
17 any such similar matter.
18 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
19 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
20 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
21 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
22 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order
23 void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
24 B. Default, Technical Assistance and Termination:
25 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
26 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
27 under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission
28 shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
29 default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing
30 the default, and any other action that the Commission may take,
31 and shall offer training and specific technical assistance
32 regarding the default.
33 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
34 default to the other Member States.
35 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
36 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
37 vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all
38 rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by this
39 Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
40 cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of
41 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
42 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
43 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
44 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
45 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
-
*SB68*

– 27 –
1 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
2 defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority and each of the
3 Member State’s State Licensing Authority.
4 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
5 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
6 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
7 beyond the effective date of termination.
8 F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
9 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
10 Licensees within that State of such termination. The terminated
11 State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
12 this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of
13 said notice of termination.
14 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
15 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
16 Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission
17 and the defaulting State.
18 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
19 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
20 of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
21 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
22 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
23 I. Dispute Resolution:
24 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall
25 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
26 among Member States and between Member and non-Member
27 States.
28 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
29 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as
30 appropriate.
31 J. Enforcement:
32 1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission
33 may initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the
34 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
35 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
36 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
37 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
38 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
39 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
40 including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
41 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission
42 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
43 defaulting Member State’s law.
44 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
45 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
-
*SB68*

– 28 –
1 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal
2 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact
3 and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both
4 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
5 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
6 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
7 3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this
8 Compact against the Commission.
9
10 SECTION 14: EFFECTIVE DATE,
11 WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
12
13 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which
14 the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member
15 State.
16 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the
17 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of
18 the first seven Member States (“Charter Member States”) to
19 determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member
20 State is materially different than the model Compact statute.
21 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to
22 be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be
23 entitled to the default process set forth in Section 13.
24 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or
25 is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission
26 shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect
27 even if the number of Member States should be less than seven.
28 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
29 seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process
30 set forth in Section 10(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are
31 materially different from the model Compact statute and whether
32 they qualify for participation in the Compact.
33 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
34 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
35 prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission
36 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the
37 Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
38 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
39 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be
40 subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which
41 the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
42 previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force
43 and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that
44 State.
-
*SB68*

– 29 –
1 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by
2 enacting a statute repealing the same.
3 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until
4 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute.
5 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement
6 of the withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the
7 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this
8 Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
9 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
10 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such
11 withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any
12 subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
13 State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
14 this Compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such
15 notice of withdrawal.
16 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
17 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
18 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State
19 that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
20 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No
21 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding
22 upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all
23 Member States.
24
25 SECTION 15: CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
26
27 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority
28 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes,
29 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of
30 the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation
31 of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission’s
32 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
33 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if
34 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held
35 by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
36 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in
37 the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
38 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be
39 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
40 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
41 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not
42 be affected thereby.
43 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the
44 Commission may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or,
45 in accordance with the requirements of Section 13.B, terminate a
-
*SB68*

– 30 –
1 Member State’s participation in the Compact if it determines that
2 a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material
3 departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be
4 held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the
5 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
6 Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State
7 affected as to all severable matters.
8
9 SECTION 16: CONSISTENT EFFECT AND
10 CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
11
12 A. A Licensee providing services in a Remote State under a
13 Multistate Authorization to Practice shall adhere to the laws and
14 regulations, including laws, regulations, and applicable standards,
15 of the Remote State where the client is located at the time care is
16 rendered.
17 B. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
18 any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the
19 Compact.
20 C. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
21 in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to
22 the extent of the conflict.
23 D. All permissible agreements between the Commission and
24 the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.
