8 of the county or city on the requirements for processing and counting mail ballots.

12 the county and city clerks and submit a summary to the Director of the Legislative
13 Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature or Legislative Commission, as

15 Existing law requires that a mail ballot that is: (1) mailed to a county or city
16 clerk be postmarked on or before the day of the election and received by 5 p.m. on
17 the fourth day following the election; or (2) delivered by hand to the county or city
18 clerk or any drop box before the time set for closing of the polls on election day.

24 Existing law requires certain persons who have not previously voted in any
25 election for federal office in this State to include a copy of certain information in
26 the return envelope with a mail ballot. If such a person fails to provide the
27 information in the return envelope, the county or city clerk must allow the person to

35 the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her
36 signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot or
37 that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the
38 mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, but the voter is otherwise entitled to
39 cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the voter and advise the voter of the
40 procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation that the signature used for the
41 mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted,
42 the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5
43 p.m. on the sixth day following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327)

3 7 and 15 of this bill require that such procedures be fair and efficient.

5 city clerk to establish procedures to inform registered voters of the requirements for
6 voting by mail ballot. Sections 2 and 10 further require each county or city clerk to
7 provide training to election board officers and employees of the elections division
8 of the county or city on the requirements for processing and counting mail ballots.
9 Sections 3 and 11 of this bill require, after each election, the county or city

16 clerk be postmarked on or before the day of the election and received by 5 p.m. on
17 the fourth day following the election; or (2) delivered by hand to the county or city
18 clerk or any drop box before the time set for closing of the polls on election day.
19 (NRS 293.269921, 293.269923, 293C.26321, 293C.26323) Sections 5, 6, 13 and

24 Existing law requires certain persons who have not previously voted in any
25 election for federal office in this State to include a copy of certain information in
26 the return envelope with a mail ballot. If such a person fails to provide the
27 information in the return envelope, the county or city clerk must allow the person to
28 provide the required information before 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the
29 election in order for the person’s mail ballot to be counted. (NRS 293.269915,
30 293C.26314) Sections 4 and 12 of this bill provide instead that the county or city
31 clerk must allow the person to provide the required information before 5 p.m. on
32 the third day following the election in order for the person’s mail ballot to be
33 counted.
34 Existing law provides that if the county or city clerk determines when checking
35 the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her
36 signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot or
37 that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the
38 mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, but the voter is otherwise entitled to
39 cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the voter and advise the voter of the
40 procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation that the signature used for the
41 mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted,
42 the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5
43 p.m. on the sixth day following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327)
44 Sections 8 and 16 of this bill provide instead that for the mail ballot to be counted,
45 the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5
