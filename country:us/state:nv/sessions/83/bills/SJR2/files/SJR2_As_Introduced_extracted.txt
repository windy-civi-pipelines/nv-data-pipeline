SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to revise provisions relating to elections
involving incumbent justices or judges who are
unopposed.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution provides that, in an election, the person having the
2 highest number of votes for an office shall be declared elected. (Nev. Const. Art. 5,
3 § 4)
4 This joint resolution proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to provide that
5 if an incumbent justice of the Nevada Supreme Court or incumbent judge of the
6 Nevada Court of Appeals or a district court is seeking election to the office that he
7 or she holds and is not opposed by another candidate, then the ballot for that office
8 must offer a voter only the choice to retain or not retain the justice or judge. If the
9 number of votes for retaining the justice or judge is greater than the number of
10 votes against retaining the justice or judge, then the justice or judge shall be
11 declared elected. If the number of votes against retaining the justice or judge is
12 greater than the number of votes for retaining the justice or judge, then: (1) no
13 person shall be declared elected for the office; and (2) the office must be filled in
14 accordance with the existing constitutional provisions for filling a vacancy that
15 occurs before the expiration of a term of office.
1 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
2 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That Section 4 of Article 5 of the Nevada
3 Constitution be amended to read as follows:

5 or a majority thereof, shall meet at the office of the secretary
6 of state, on a day to be fixed by law, and open and canvass
7 the election returns for United States senator and member of
8 Congress, district and state officers, and for and against any
9 questions submitted to the electors of the State of Nevada,
10 and forthwith declare the result and publish the names of the
11 persons elected and the results of the vote cast upon any
12 question submitted to the electors of the State of Nevada.
13 [The] Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
14 persons having the highest number of votes for the respective
15 offices shall be declared elected, but in case any two or more
16 have an equal and the highest number of votes for the same
17 office, the legislature shall, by joint vote of both houses, elect
18 one of said persons to fill said office. If, in an election for a
19 judicial office in the Supreme Court, the court of appeals or
20 a district court, an incumbent justice or judge, as applicable,
21 is not opposed by another candidate and the number of
22 votes for retaining the justice or judge is greater than the
23 number of votes against retaining the justice or judge, then
24 the justice or judge shall be declared elected, but if the
25 number of votes against retaining the justice or judge is
26 greater than the number of votes for retaining the justice or
27 judge, then no person shall be declared elected for the office
28 and the office must be filled for the term to which the
29 election pertains in accordance with the provisions of
30 Section 20 of Article 6 as if the vacancy had occurred before
31 the expiration of the term of the office.
32 And be it further
33 RESOLVED, That Section 3 of Article 6 of the Nevada
34 Constitution be amended to read as follows:
35 [Sec:] Sec. 3. The justices of the Supreme Court [,] shall

39 their election; provided, that there shall be elected, at the first
40 election under this Constitution, three justices of the Supreme
41 Court who shall hold office from and including the first
42 Monday of December A.D., eighteen hundred and sixty four,

5 having the next shortest term shall be Chief Justice, after
6 which the senior justice in commission shall be Chief Justice;

8 justices shall bear the same date, they shall determine by lot,
9 who shall be Chief Justice. If an incumbent justice seeks
10 election to the office that he or she holds and is not opposed
11 by another candidate, then the ballot for the election of that
12 office must offer a voter only the choice to “Retain” or “Not
13 Retain” the incumbent justice.

15 RESOLVED, That Section 3A of Article 6 of the Nevada
16 Constitution be amended to read as follows:
17 Sec. 3A. 1. The court of appeals consists of three
18 judges or such greater number as the Legislature may provide
19 by law. If the number of judges is so increased, the Supreme
20 Court must provide by rule for the assignment of each appeal
21 to a panel of three judges for decision.
22 2. After the initial terms, each judge of the court of
23 appeals must be elected by the qualified electors of this State
24 at the general election for a term of 6 years beginning on the
25 first Monday of January next after the election. The initial
26 three judges of the court of appeals must be appointed by the
27 Governor from among three nominees selected for each
28 individual seat by the permanent Commission on Judicial
29 Selection described in subsection 3 of section 20 of this
30 Article. After the expiration of 30 days from the date on
31 which the permanent Commission on Judicial Selection has
32 delivered to the Governor its list of nominees for the initial
33 judges, if the Governor has not made the appointments
34 required by this Section, the Governor shall make no other
35 appointment to any public office until the Governor has
36 appointed a judge from the list submitted. The term of the
37 initial judges is 2 years beginning on the first Monday of
38 January next after the effective date of this Section, and an
39 initial judge may succeed himself. If an incumbent judge
40 seeks election to the office that he or she holds and is not
41 opposed by another candidate, then the ballot for the
42 election of that office must offer a voter only the choice to
43 “Retain” or “Not Retain” the incumbent judge. If there is an

7 of the initial chief judge is 2 years. The chief judge may
8 succeed himself. The chief judge may resign the position of
9 chief judge without resigning from the court of appeals.
10 4. The Supreme Court shall provide by rule for the
11 assignment of one or more judges of the court of appeals to
12 devote a part of their time to serve as supplemental district
13 judges, where needed.
14 And be it further
15 RESOLVED, That Section 5 of Article 6 of the Nevada
16 Constitution be amended to read as follows:
17 Sec. 5. The State is hereby divided into nine judicial
18 districts of which the County of Storey shall constitute the
19 First; The County of Ormsby the Second; the County of Lyon
20 the Third; The County of Washoe the Fourth; The Counties of
21 Nye and Churchill the Fifth; The County of Humboldt the
22 Sixth; The County of Lander the Seventh; The County of
23 Douglas the Eighth; and the County of Esmeralda the Ninth.
24 The County of Roop shall be attached to the County of
25 Washoe for judicial purposes until otherwise provided by
26 law. The Legislature may, however, provide by law for an
27 alteration in the boundaries or divisions of the districts herein
28 prescribed, and also for increasing or diminishing the number
29 of the judicial districts and judges therein. But no such
30 change shall take effect, except in case of a vacancy, or the
31 expiration of the term of an incumbent of the office. At the
32 first general election under this Constitution there shall be
33 elected in each of the respective districts (except as in this
34 Section hereafter otherwise provided) one district judge, who
35 shall hold office from and including the first Monday of
36 December A.D., eighteen hundred and sixty four and until the

40 expiration of the term of his predecessor, one district judge in
41 each of the respective judicial districts (except in the First
42 District as in this Section hereinafter provided.) The district
43 judges shall be elected by the qualified electors of their
44 respective districts, and shall hold office for the term of 6
45 years (excepting those elected at said first election) from and
-

3 District shall be entitled to, and shall have three district
4 judges, who shall possess co-extensive and concurrent
5 jurisdiction, and who shall be elected at the same times, in the
6 same manner, and shall hold office for the like terms as
7 herein prescribed, in relation to the judges in other judicial
8 districts, any one of said judges may preside on the
9 empanneling [empaneling] of grand juries and the
10 presentment and trial on indictments, under such rules and
11 regulations as may be prescribed by law. If an incumbent
12 judge seeks election to the office that he or she holds and is
13 not opposed by another candidate, then the ballot for the
14 election of that office must offer a voter only the choice to
15 “Retain” or “Not Retain” the incumbent judge.
