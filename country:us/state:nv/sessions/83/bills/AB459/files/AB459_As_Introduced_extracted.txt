Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of transportation network companies
2 by the Nevada Transportation Authority. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Existing law
3 authorizes a transportation network company to enter into an agreement with one or
4 more drivers, or monitored autonomous vehicle providers, to receive connections to
5 potential passengers from the company in exchange for the payment of a fee by the
6 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider to the company. (NRS 706A.160,
7 706A.161) Section 13 of this bill requires a transportation network company to
-

8 adopt a written policy relating to the suspension and deactivation of drivers and
9 monitored autonomous vehicle providers. Section 13 requires the policy to
10 specifically list the conduct for which the transportation network company may
11 suspend a driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider. Section 13 prohibits a
12 transportation network company from suspending or deactivating a driver or
13 monitored autonomous vehicle provider in a manner that is inconsistent with the
14 written policy. If a transportation network company suspends or deactivates a
15 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider, section 14 of this bill requires
16 the company to transmit a notice containing certain information to the driver or
17 monitored autonomous vehicle provider who was suspended or deactivated.
18 Section 15 of this bill requires a transportation network company to establish an
19 internal process through which a driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider
20 who has been deactivated may request that the company reconsider the
21 deactivation. Section 15 establishes certain requirements for the process required of
22 a transportation network company after receiving a request for reconsideration of a
23 deactivation, including a requirement that the company process a request for
24 reconsideration within a certain amount of time. If a transportation network
25 company reverses or lifts a deactivation of a driver or monitored autonomous
26 vehicle provider through this process, section 15 requires the company to fully
27 restore the account of the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider on the
28 platform used by the company within 24 hours after notifying the driver or
29 monitored autonomous vehicle provider. Section 16 of this bill prohibits a
30 transportation network company from including certain terms relating to dispute
31 resolution in an agreement between the company and a driver or monitored
32 autonomous vehicle provider. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a transportation
33 network company from suspending, deactivating or retaliating against a driver or
34 monitored autonomous vehicle provider for lawfully accepting or rejecting a task
35 offered by the company to the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider.
36 Existing law requires a transportation network company to provide a receipt to
37 a passenger documenting certain information relating to the price charged to the
38 passenger by the company for the provision of transportation services. (NRS
39 706A.210) Section 17 of this bill requires a transportation network company to
40 disclose to a driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider within the digital
41 application or software application service of the company certain information
42 relating to a task offered by the company to the driver or monitored autonomous
43 vehicle provider, including: (1) the amount that the company will pay the driver or
44 monitored autonomous vehicle provider for the task; (2) any amount of tip that a
45 passenger has indicated will be paid to the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle
46 provider; and (3) certain information regarding the direction, time and distance that
47 the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider will be required to drive in
48 order to complete the task. Section 17 also requires a transportation network
49 company to disclose a summary of certain information relating to the tasks that the
50 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider has completed for the company
51 within the last month, or if the company voluntarily reports such information more
52 frequently, tasks completed since the company last disclosed such information to
53 the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider. Section 27 of this bill
54 requires a transportation network company to disclose to a passenger to whom a
55 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider has been connected through the
56 digital application or software application service of the company, before the
57 passenger is offered an option in the application or service to tip the driver or
58 monitored autonomous vehicle provider: (1) the fare that the passenger has paid or
59 will pay for the trip; and (2) the amount of money that the company will pay the
60 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider for completing the trip. Section
61 27 requires a transportation network company to prominently present this
62 disclosure to the passenger in a certain manner.

63 Section 19 of this bill authorizes certain organizations whose primary purpose
64 is educating and providing certain support and services to drivers and monitored
65 autonomous vehicle providers in this State to apply to be certified by the Authority
66 as the certified driver support organization for this State. Section 19 authorizes an
67 organization to be certified as the certified driver support organization for a term of
68 3 years, and to be re-certified for additional terms by following the same
69 procedures for an original certification. Section 20 of this bill requires certain
70 information regarding the certified driver support organization to be transmitted to
71 transportation network companies, drivers and monitored autonomous vehicle
72 providers under certain circumstances. Section 22 of this bill establishes the duties
73 of the certified driver support organization, which include: (1) representing drivers
74 and monitored autonomous vehicle providers through processes offered to a driver
75 or monitored autonomous vehicle provider by a transportation network company
76 for handling disputes between the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider
77 and company, including a dispute over a suspension or deactivation; (2) providing
78 support and additional resources for drivers and monitored autonomous vehicle
79 providers who may pursue dispute resolution through other means; and (3)
80 providing other education, services and support to drivers and monitored
81 autonomous vehicle providers in this State. Section 21 of this bill requires the
82 certified driver support organization to propose a budget for approval by the
83 Authority. Section 21 requires that the budget not exceed a certain amount, based
84 on the total number of transportation tasks undertaken in this State by all
85 transportation network companies in the immediately preceding year. Section 21
86 prohibits the certified driver support organization from using funds from the budget
87 for any purpose not described in section 22. To fund the budget, section 21
88 requires each transportation network company holding a permit issued by the
89 Authority to remit, on a quarterly basis, a share of the amount of budget of the
90 organization approved by the Authority that is proportional to the number of
91 transportation tasks undertaken by the transportation network company in this State
92 during the immediately preceding year. Additionally, section 23 of this bill requires
93 a transportation network company to establish means by which a driver may
94 request a portion of his or her earnings be deducted by the company for credit to the
95 certified driver support organization. Section 21 requires the certified driver
96 support organization to biannually submit certain materials to the Authority to
97 evidence compliance with the requirements of sections 21 and 22. Section 21
98 authorizes the Authority to revoke the certification of the organization if the
99 organization has spent funds for unauthorized purposes or if the organization no
100 longer qualifies for certification.
101 Section 24 of this bill authorizes a driver, monitored autonomous vehicle
102 provider or passenger who is injured by a violation of sections 2-25 of this bill or
103 certain provisions governing information which must be provided to a passenger to
104 bring a civil action against the transportation network company who is alleged to
105 have committed the violation to obtain certain relief. Section 24 also authorizes the
106 Authority to impose an administrative fine on a transportation network company
107 who is determined to have committed such a violation in an amount based on the
108 number of drivers or passengers affected by the violation. Section 25 of this bill
109 requires each transportation network company that holds a permit issued by the
110 Authority to biannually submit certain reports to the Authority.
111 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the use of a digital network or software
112 application service of a transportation network company to connect a passenger to a
113 driver for the purpose of providing transportation services at the rate of 3 percent of
114 the total fare charged for the transportation services. (NRS 372B.140) Existing law
115 also imposes an excise tax on the use of a dispatch center, software application or
116 other digital means by an autonomous vehicle network company to connect a
117 passenger to a fully autonomous vehicle for the purpose of providing transportation
-
*AB459*
– 4 –
118 services at the rate of 3 percent of the total fare charged for the transportation
119 services. (NRS 372B.145) Sections 29 and 30 of this bill impose an additional tax
120 on such activities by a transportation network company or autonomous vehicle
121 network company, respectively, at the rate of $1 for each transportation task, which
122 is defined as a specific trip during which transportation services are provided after a
123 connection to a passenger is made through such a digital network, software
124 application, dispatch center or other digital means, as applicable. Sections 29 and
125 30 require the proceeds of this tax to be used: (1) to reimburse the State for the cost
126 of collecting the tax; and (2) by a regional transportation commission or county to
127 pay the cost of establishing, operating or maintaining a public transit system.
128 Section 26 of this bill provides that the excise tax imposed by section 29 applies to
129 transportation tasks undertaken by a limousine driver pursuant to a contract with a
130 transportation network company.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to transportation; requiring transportation network
companies to establish certain policies and procedures;
establishing certain requirements relating to the
suspension or deactivation of drivers and monitored

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of transportation network companies
2 by the Nevada Transportation Authority. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Existing law
3 authorizes a transportation network company to enter into an agreement with one or
4 more drivers, or monitored autonomous vehicle providers, to receive connections to
5 potential passengers from the company in exchange for the payment of a fee by the
6 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider to the company. (NRS 706A.160,
7 706A.161) Section 13 of this bill requires a transportation network company to

13 monitored autonomous vehicle provider in a manner that is inconsistent with the
14 written policy. If a transportation network company suspends or deactivates a
15 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider, section 14 of this bill requires
16 the company to transmit a notice containing certain information to the driver or
17 monitored autonomous vehicle provider who was suspended or deactivated.
18 Section 15 of this bill requires a transportation network company to establish an
19 internal process through which a driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider
20 who has been deactivated may request that the company reconsider the
21 deactivation. Section 15 establishes certain requirements for the process required of
22 a transportation network company after receiving a request for reconsideration of a
23 deactivation, including a requirement that the company process a request for
24 reconsideration within a certain amount of time. If a transportation network
25 company reverses or lifts a deactivation of a driver or monitored autonomous
26 vehicle provider through this process, section 15 requires the company to fully
27 restore the account of the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider on the
28 platform used by the company within 24 hours after notifying the driver or
29 monitored autonomous vehicle provider. Section 16 of this bill prohibits a
30 transportation network company from including certain terms relating to dispute
31 resolution in an agreement between the company and a driver or monitored
32 autonomous vehicle provider. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a transportation
33 network company from suspending, deactivating or retaliating against a driver or
34 monitored autonomous vehicle provider for lawfully accepting or rejecting a task
35 offered by the company to the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider.
36 Existing law requires a transportation network company to provide a receipt to
37 a passenger documenting certain information relating to the price charged to the
38 passenger by the company for the provision of transportation services. (NRS
39 706A.210) Section 17 of this bill requires a transportation network company to
40 disclose to a driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider within the digital
41 application or software application service of the company certain information
42 relating to a task offered by the company to the driver or monitored autonomous
43 vehicle provider, including: (1) the amount that the company will pay the driver or
44 monitored autonomous vehicle provider for the task; (2) any amount of tip that a
45 passenger has indicated will be paid to the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle
46 provider; and (3) certain information regarding the direction, time and distance that
47 the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider will be required to drive in
48 order to complete the task. Section 17 also requires a transportation network
49 company to disclose a summary of certain information relating to the tasks that the
50 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider has completed for the company
51 within the last month, or if the company voluntarily reports such information more
52 frequently, tasks completed since the company last disclosed such information to
53 the driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider. Section 27 of this bill
54 requires a transportation network company to disclose to a passenger to whom a
55 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider has been connected through the
56 digital application or software application service of the company, before the
57 passenger is offered an option in the application or service to tip the driver or
58 monitored autonomous vehicle provider: (1) the fare that the passenger has paid or
59 will pay for the trip; and (2) the amount of money that the company will pay the
60 driver or monitored autonomous vehicle provider for completing the trip. Section
61 27 requires a transportation network company to prominently present this
62 disclosure to the passenger in a certain manner.

85 transportation network companies in the immediately preceding year. Section 21
86 prohibits the certified driver support organization from using funds from the budget
87 for any purpose not described in section 22. To fund the budget, section 21
88 requires each transportation network company holding a permit issued by the
89 Authority to remit, on a quarterly basis, a share of the amount of budget of the
90 organization approved by the Authority that is proportional to the number of
91 transportation tasks undertaken by the transportation network company in this State
92 during the immediately preceding year. Additionally, section 23 of this bill requires
93 a transportation network company to establish means by which a driver may
94 request a portion of his or her earnings be deducted by the company for credit to the
95 certified driver support organization. Section 21 requires the certified driver
96 support organization to biannually submit certain materials to the Authority to
97 evidence compliance with the requirements of sections 21 and 22. Section 21
98 authorizes the Authority to revoke the certification of the organization if the

100 longer qualifies for certification.
101 Section 24 of this bill authorizes a driver, monitored autonomous vehicle
102 provider or passenger who is injured by a violation of sections 2-25 of this bill or
103 certain provisions governing information which must be provided to a passenger to
104 bring a civil action against the transportation network company who is alleged to
105 have committed the violation to obtain certain relief. Section 24 also authorizes the
106 Authority to impose an administrative fine on a transportation network company
107 who is determined to have committed such a violation in an amount based on the
108 number of drivers or passengers affected by the violation. Section 25 of this bill
109 requires each transportation network company that holds a permit issued by the
110 Authority to biannually submit certain reports to the Authority.
111 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the use of a digital network or software
112 application service of a transportation network company to connect a passenger to a
113 driver for the purpose of providing transportation services at the rate of 3 percent of
114 the total fare charged for the transportation services. (NRS 372B.140) Existing law
115 also imposes an excise tax on the use of a dispatch center, software application or
116 other digital means by an autonomous vehicle network company to connect a
117 passenger to a fully autonomous vehicle for the purpose of providing transportation

118 services at the rate of 3 percent of the total fare charged for the transportation
119 services. (NRS 372B.145) Sections 29 and 30 of this bill impose an additional tax
120 on such activities by a transportation network company or autonomous vehicle
121 network company, respectively, at the rate of $1 for each transportation task, which
122 is defined as a specific trip during which transportation services are provided after a
123 connection to a passenger is made through such a digital network, software
124 application, dispatch center or other digital means, as applicable. Sections 29 and
125 30 require the proceeds of this tax to be used: (1) to reimburse the State for the cost
126 of collecting the tax; and (2) by a regional transportation commission or county to
127 pay the cost of establishing, operating or maintaining a public transit system.
128 Section 26 of this bill provides that the excise tax imposed by section 29 applies to
129 transportation tasks undertaken by a limousine driver pursuant to a contract with a
130 transportation network company.
