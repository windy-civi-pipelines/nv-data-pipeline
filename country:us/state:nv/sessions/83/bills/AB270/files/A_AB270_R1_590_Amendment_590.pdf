EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional regulation; revising provisions relating to a
certificate of registration to practice architecture; revising
provisions relating to certain examinations required for licensure as a
professional engineer or professional land surveyor; revising the
circumstances under which the State Board of Professional Engineers
and Land Surveyors may waive certain examinations for certain
applicants for licensure; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from practicing architecture in this State without a
2 certificate of registration issued by the State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and
3 Residential Design. (NRS 623.180) Before receiving a certificate of registration, existing
4 law requires an applicant to pass an examination adopted by the Board. (NRS 623.200)
5 Section 1 of this bill requires the Board, through December 31, 2026, to accept evidence
6 that the applicant is a laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize in lieu of an
7 examination.
8 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional engineer to pass: (1) an
9 examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that requirement; and
10 (2) an examination on the principles and practices of engineering that must cover the
11 discipline of engineering in which the applicant is applying for licensure. Existing law
12 prohibits an applicant from taking the examination on the principles and practices of
13 engineering unless the applicant has passed the examination on the fundamentals of
14 engineering or received a waiver of that requirement. Existing law authorizes the State Board
15 of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors to waive the examination on the fundamentals
16 of engineering if the applicant: (1) has graduated from an engineering curriculum that is
17 approved by the Board; and (2) has 15 or more years of experience in engineering. (NRS
18 625.183, 625.193)
19 Sections [1] 1.5 and 2 of this bill remove the requirement that an applicant must pass the
20 examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that requirement
21 before taking the examination on the principles and practices of engineering. Section 2 revises
22 the years of experience required to waive the examination on the fundamentals of engineering
23 from 15 years of experience in engineering to 10 years of active experience in engineering.

24 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional land surveyor to pass:
25 (1) an examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that
26 requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices of land surveying.
27 Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the examination on the principles and
28 practices of land surveying unless the applicant: (1) is a graduate of a land-surveying
29 curriculum of 4 or more years that is approved by the Board; and (2) has passed the
30 examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or received a waiver of that requirement.
31 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Board to waive the examination on the fundamentals of land
32 surveying if the applicant has 15 or more years of experience in land surveying; and (2)
33 requires the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is approved
34 by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience for purposes of the waiver. (NRS
35 625.270, 625.280)
36 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill remove the requirements that an applicant must be a graduate
37 of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board and pass the examination on the
38 fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that requirement before taking the
39 examination on the principles and practices of land surveying. Section 4 revises the
40 requirements to waive the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying by: (1) adding a
41 requirement that an applicant be a graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by
42 the Board; (2) revising the years of experience required from 15 years of experience in land
43 surveying to 10 years of active experience in land surveying; and (3) removing the
44 requirement for the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is
45 approved by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience.
46 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the content and administration of
47 examinations on the fundamentals of engineering or land surveying and the principles and
48 practices of engineering or land surveying. (NRS 625.193, 625.280) Sections 2 and 4 remove
49 those requirements and instead require applicants for licensure to pass an applicable
50 examination administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and
51 Surveying or its successor organization or another equivalent examination that is approved by
52 the Board.
