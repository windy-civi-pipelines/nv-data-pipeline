Hafen, Backus and Marzola
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to professional regulation; revising provisions
relating to a certificate of registration to practice architecture;
revising provisions relating to certain examinations required
for licensure as a professional engineer or professional land
surveyor; revising the circumstances under which the State
Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors may
waive certain examinations for certain applicants for
licensure; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits a person from practicing architecture in this State
without a certificate of registration issued by the State Board of Architecture,
Interior Design and Residential Design. (NRS 623.180) Before receiving a
certificate of registration, existing law requires an applicant to pass an examination
adopted by the Board. (NRS 623.200) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board,
through December 31, 2026, to accept evidence that the applicant is a laureate of
the Pritzker Architecture Prize in lieu of an examination.
Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional engineer to
pass: (1) an examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of
that requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices of
engineering that must cover the discipline of engineering in which the applicant is
applying for licensure. Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the
examination on the principles and practices of engineering unless the applicant has
passed the examination on the fundamentals of engineering or received a waiver of
that requirement. Existing law authorizes the State Board of Professional Engineers
and Land Surveyors to waive the examination on the fundamentals of engineering
if the applicant: (1) has graduated from an engineering curriculum that is approved
by the Board; and (2) has 15 or more years of experience in engineering. (NRS
625.183, 625.193)
Sections 1.5 and 2 of this bill remove the requirement that an applicant must
pass the examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that
requirement before taking the examination on the principles and practices of
engineering. Section 2 revises the years of experience required to waive the
examination on the fundamentals of engineering from 15 years of experience in
engineering to 10 years of active experience in engineering.
Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional land surveyor
to pass: (1) an examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a
waiver of that requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices
of land surveying. Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the examination
on the principles and practices of land surveying unless the applicant: (1) is a
graduate of a land-surveying curriculum of 4 or more years that is approved by the
Board; and (2) has passed the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying
or received a waiver of that requirement. Existing law: (1) authorizes the Board to
waive the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying if the applicant has
15 or more years of experience in land surveying; and (2) requires the Board to
consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience for purposes of the waiver. (NRS
625.270, 625.280)
Sections 3 and 4 of this bill remove the requirements that an applicant must be
a graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board and pass
the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that
requirement before taking the examination on the principles and practices of land
surveying. Section 4 revises the requirements to waive the examination on the
fundamentals of land surveying by: (1) adding a requirement that an applicant be a
graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board; (2) revising
the years of experience required from 15 years of experience in land surveying to
10 years of active experience in land surveying; and (3) removing the requirement
for the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is
approved by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the content and administration
of examinations on the fundamentals of engineering or land surveying and the
principles and practices of engineering or land surveying. (NRS 625.193, 625.280)
Sections 2 and 4 remove those requirements and instead require applicants for
licensure to pass an applicable examination administered by the National Council
of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying or its successor organization or
another equivalent examination that is approved by the Board.
