EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional regulation; revising provisions
relating to a certificate of registration to practice
architecture; revising provisions relating to certain
examinations required for licensure as a professional
engineer or professional land surveyor; revising the
circumstances under which the State Board of
Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors may waive
certain examinations for certain applicants for licensure;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from practicing architecture in this State
2 without a certificate of registration issued by the State Board of Architecture,
3 Interior Design and Residential Design. (NRS 623.180) Before receiving a
4 certificate of registration, existing law requires an applicant to pass an examination
5 adopted by the Board. (NRS 623.200) Section 1 of this bill requires the Board,
6 through December 31, 2026, to accept evidence that the applicant is a laureate of
7 the Pritzker Architecture Prize in lieu of an examination.
8 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional engineer to
9 pass: (1) an examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of
10 that requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices of
11 engineering that must cover the discipline of engineering in which the applicant is
12 applying for licensure. Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the
13 examination on the principles and practices of engineering unless the applicant has
14 passed the examination on the fundamentals of engineering or received a waiver of
15 that requirement. Existing law authorizes the State Board of Professional Engineers
16 and Land Surveyors to waive the examination on the fundamentals of engineering
17 if the applicant: (1) has graduated from an engineering curriculum that is approved
-
*AB270_R2*

– 2 –
18 by the Board; and (2) has 15 or more years of experience in engineering. (NRS
19 625.183, 625.193)
20 Sections 1.5 and 2 of this bill remove the requirement that an applicant must
21 pass the examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that
22 requirement before taking the examination on the principles and practices of
23 engineering. Section 2 revises the years of experience required to waive the
24 examination on the fundamentals of engineering from 15 years of experience in
25 engineering to 10 years of active experience in engineering.
26 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional land surveyor
27 to pass: (1) an examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a
28 waiver of that requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices
29 of land surveying. Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the examination
30 on the principles and practices of land surveying unless the applicant: (1) is a
31 graduate of a land-surveying curriculum of 4 or more years that is approved by the
32 Board; and (2) has passed the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying
33 or received a waiver of that requirement. Existing law: (1) authorizes the Board to
34 waive the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying if the applicant has
35 15 or more years of experience in land surveying; and (2) requires the Board to
36 consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the
37 Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience for purposes of the waiver. (NRS
38 625.270, 625.280)
39 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill remove the requirements that an applicant must be
40 a graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board and pass
41 the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that
42 requirement before taking the examination on the principles and practices of land
43 surveying. Section 4 revises the requirements to waive the examination on the
44 fundamentals of land surveying by: (1) adding a requirement that an applicant be a
45 graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board; (2) revising
46 the years of experience required from 15 years of experience in land surveying to
47 10 years of active experience in land surveying; and (3) removing the requirement
48 for the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is
49 approved by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience.
50 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the content and administration
51 of examinations on the fundamentals of engineering or land surveying and the
52 principles and practices of engineering or land surveying. (NRS 625.193, 625.280)
53 Sections 2 and 4 remove those requirements and instead require applicants for
54 licensure to pass an applicable examination administered by the National Council
55 of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying or its successor organization or
56 another equivalent examination that is approved by the Board.
