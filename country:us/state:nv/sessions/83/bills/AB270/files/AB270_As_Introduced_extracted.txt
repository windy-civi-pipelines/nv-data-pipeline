SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to professional engineers
and land surveyors. (BDR 54-773)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional regulation; revising provisions
relating to certain examinations required for licensure as a
professional engineer or professional land surveyor;
revising the circumstances under which the State Board of
Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors may waive
certain examinations for certain applicants for licensure;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional engineer to
2 pass: (1) an examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of
3 that requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices of
4 engineering that must cover the discipline of engineering in which the applicant is
5 applying for licensure. Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the
6 examination on the principles and practices of engineering unless the applicant has
7 passed the examination on the fundamentals of engineering or received a waiver of
8 that requirement. Existing law authorizes the State Board of Professional Engineers
9 and Land Surveyors to waive the examination on the fundamentals of engineering
10 if the applicant: (1) has graduated from an engineering curriculum that is approved
11 by the Board; and (2) has 15 or more years of experience in engineering. (NRS
12 625.183, 625.193)
13 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill remove the requirement that an applicant must
14 pass the examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that
15 requirement before taking the examination on the principles and practices of
16 engineering. Section 2 revises the years of experience required to waive the
17 examination on the fundamentals of engineering from 15 years of experience in
18 engineering to 8 years of active experience in engineering.
19 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional land surveyor
20 to pass: (1) an examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a
-
*AB270*
– 2 –
21 waiver of that requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices
22 of land surveying. Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the examination
23 on the principles and practices of land surveying unless the applicant: (1) is a
24 graduate of a land-surveying curriculum of 4 or more years that is approved by the
25 Board; and (2) has passed the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying
26 or received a waiver of that requirement. Existing law: (1) authorizes the Board to
27 waive the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying if the applicant has
28 15 or more years of experience in land surveying; and (2) requires the Board to
29 consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the
30 Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience for purposes of the waiver. (NRS
31 625.270, 625.280)
32 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill remove the requirements that an applicant must be
33 a graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board and pass
34 the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that
35 requirement before taking the examination on the principles and practices of land
36 surveying. Section 4 revises the requirements to waive the examination on the
37 fundamentals of land surveying by: (1) adding a requirement that an applicant be a
38 graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board; (2) revising
39 the years of experience required from 15 years of experience in land surveying to 8
40 years of active experience in land surveying; and (3) removing the requirement for
41 the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is approved
42 by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience.
43 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the content and administration
44 of examinations on the fundamentals of engineering or land surveying and the
45 principles and practices of engineering or land surveying. (NRS 625.193, 625.280)
46 Sections 2 and 4 remove those requirements and instead require applicants for
47 licensure to pass an applicable examination administered by the National Council
48 of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying or its successor organization or
49 another equivalent examination that is approved by the Board.
