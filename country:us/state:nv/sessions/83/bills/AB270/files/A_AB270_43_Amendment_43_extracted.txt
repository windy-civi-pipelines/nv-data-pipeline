surveyors. (BDR 54-773)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professional regulation; revising provisions relating to certain
examinations required for licensure as a professional engineer or
professional land surveyor; revising the circumstances under which the
State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors may waive
certain examinations for certain applicants for licensure; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional engineer to pass: (1) an
2 examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that requirement; and
3 (2) an examination on the principles and practices of engineering that must cover the
4 discipline of engineering in which the applicant is applying for licensure. Existing law
5 prohibits an applicant from taking the examination on the principles and practices of
6 engineering unless the applicant has passed the examination on the fundamentals of
7 engineering or received a waiver of that requirement. Existing law authorizes the State Board
8 of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors to waive the examination on the fundamentals
9 of engineering if the applicant: (1) has graduated from an engineering curriculum that is
10 approved by the Board; and (2) has 15 or more years of experience in engineering. (NRS
11 625.183, 625.193)
12 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill remove the requirement that an applicant must pass the
13 examination on the fundamentals of engineering or receive a waiver of that requirement
14 before taking the examination on the principles and practices of engineering. Section 2 revises
15 the years of experience required to waive the examination on the fundamentals of engineering
16 from 15 years of experience in engineering to [8] 10 years of active experience in engineering.
17 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a professional land surveyor to pass:
18 (1) an examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that
19 requirement; and (2) an examination on the principles and practices of land surveying.
20 Existing law prohibits an applicant from taking the examination on the principles and
21 practices of land surveying unless the applicant: (1) is a graduate of a land-surveying
22 curriculum of 4 or more years that is approved by the Board; and (2) has passed the
23 examination on the fundamentals of land surveying or received a waiver of that requirement.
24 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Board to waive the examination on the fundamentals of land
25 surveying if the applicant has 15 or more years of experience in land surveying; and (2)
26 requires the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is approved
Assembly Amendment No. 43 to Assembly Bill No. 270 Page 4
27 by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience for purposes of the waiver. (NRS
28 625.270, 625.280)
29 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill remove the requirements that an applicant must be a graduate
30 of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by the Board and pass the examination on the
31 fundamentals of land surveying or receive a waiver of that requirement before taking the
32 examination on the principles and practices of land surveying. Section 4 revises the
33 requirements to waive the examination on the fundamentals of land surveying by: (1) adding a
34 requirement that an applicant be a graduate of a land-surveying curriculum that is approved by
35 the Board; (2) revising the years of experience required from 15 years of experience in land
36 surveying to [8] 10 years of active experience in land surveying; and (3) removing the
37 requirement for the Board to consider graduation from a land-surveying curriculum that is
38 approved by the Board to be equivalent to 4 years of experience.
39 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the content and administration of
40 examinations on the fundamentals of engineering or land surveying and the principles and
41 practices of engineering or land surveying. (NRS 625.193, 625.280) Sections 2 and 4 remove
42 those requirements and instead require applicants for licensure to pass an applicable
43 examination administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and
44 Surveying or its successor organization or another equivalent examination that is approved by
45 the Board.
