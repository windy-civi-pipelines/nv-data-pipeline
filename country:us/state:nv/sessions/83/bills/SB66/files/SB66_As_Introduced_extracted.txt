AN ACT relating to writs of habeas corpus; revising provisions
governing the county in which an offender must file a
postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus
challenging the computation of time the offender has
served; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes an offender who is convicted of a crime and under
2 a sentence of death or imprisonment to file a postconviction petition for a writ of
3 habeas corpus; and (2) prescribes requirements governing the county in which any
4 such petition must be filed. (NRS 34.724, 34.738) Under existing law, a
5 postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the computation of
6 time an offender has served must be filed with the clerk of the district court for the
7 county in which the conviction occurred, unless the petitioner is incarcerated
8 outside this State. If the petitioner is incarcerated outside this State, existing law
9 requires the petitioner to file the petition with the clerk of the First Judicial District
10 Court in Carson City. (NRS 34.738) Section 1 of this bill revises these
11 requirements by requiring a petitioner to file a postconviction petition for a writ of
12 habeas corpus challenging the computation of time served by the petitioner with the
13 clerk of: (1) the district court for the county in which the petitioner is incarcerated,
14 if, at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner is incarcerated in this State; (2)
15 the district court for the county in which the petitioner resides, if, at the time the
16 petition is filed, the petitioner has been released from the custody of the
17 Department of Corrections and resides in this State; or (3) the First Judicial District
18 Court in Carson City, if, at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner is
19 incarcerated outside this State or has been released from the custody of the
20 Department and resides outside this State. Section 2 of this bill makes the

1 Section 1. NRS 34.738 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 34.738 1. A petition that challenges the validity of a
3 judgment of conviction or sentence must be filed with the clerk of
4 the district court for the county in which the conviction occurred.
5 Any other petition must be filed with the clerk of:
6 (a) The district court for the county in which the petitioner is
7 incarcerated [; or] , if, at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner
8 is incarcerated in this State;

11 released from the custody of the Department of Corrections and

22 clerk of the district court in which the petition is initially lodged;
23 and
24 (b) Must be transferred by the clerk of that court to the clerk of
25 the district court for the appropriate county.
26 3. A petition must not challenge both the validity of a judgment
27 of conviction or sentence and the computation of time that the
28 petitioner has served pursuant to a judgment of conviction. If a
29 petition improperly challenges both the validity of a judgment of
30 conviction or sentence and the computation of time that the
31 petitioner has served pursuant to a judgment of conviction, the
32 district court for the appropriate county shall resolve that portion of
33 the petition that challenges the validity of the judgment of
34 conviction or sentence and dismiss the remainder of the petition
35 without prejudice.
