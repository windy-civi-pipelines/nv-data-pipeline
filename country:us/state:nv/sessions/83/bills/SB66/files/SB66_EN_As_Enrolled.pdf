Senate Bill No. 66–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to writs of habeas corpus; revising provisions
governing the county in which an offender must file a
postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus
challenging the computation of time the offender has served;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) authorizes an offender who is convicted of a crime and under
a sentence of death or imprisonment to file a postconviction petition for a writ of
habeas corpus; and (2) prescribes requirements governing the county in which any
such petition must be filed. (NRS 34.724, 34.738) Under existing law, a
postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the computation of
time an offender has served must be filed with the clerk of the district court for the
county in which the conviction occurred, unless the petitioner is incarcerated
outside this State. If the petitioner is incarcerated outside this State, existing law
requires the petitioner to file the petition with the clerk of the First Judicial District
Court in Carson City. (NRS 34.738) Section 1 of this bill revises these
requirements by requiring a petitioner to file a postconviction petition for a writ of
habeas corpus challenging the computation of time served by the petitioner with the
clerk of: (1) the district court for the county in which the petitioner is incarcerated,
if, at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner is incarcerated in this State; (2)
the district court for the county in which the petitioner resides, if, at the time the
petition is filed, the petitioner has been released from the custody of the
Department of Corrections and resides in this State; or (3) the First Judicial District
Court in Carson City, if, at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner is
incarcerated outside this State or has been released from the custody of the
Department and resides outside this State. Section 2 of this bill makes the
amendatory provisions of section 1 applicable to a postconviction petition for a
writ of habeas corpus filed on or after the effective date of this bill.

released from the custody of the Department of Corrections and
resides in this State; or
(c) The First Judicial District Court in and for Carson City, if ,
at the time the petition is filed, the petitioner [is] :
(1) Is incarcerated outside this State while serving a term of
imprisonment imposed by a court of this State [.] ; or
(2) Has been released from the custody of the Department
of Corrections and resides outside this State.
2. A petition that is not filed in the district court for the
appropriate county:
(a) Shall be deemed to be filed on the date it is received by the
clerk of the district court in which the petition is initially lodged;
and
(b) Must be transferred by the clerk of that court to the clerk of
the district court for the appropriate county.
3. A petition must not challenge both the validity of a judgment
of conviction or sentence and the computation of time that the
petitioner has served pursuant to a judgment of conviction. If a
petition improperly challenges both the validity of a judgment of
conviction or sentence and the computation of time that the
petitioner has served pursuant to a judgment of conviction, the
district court for the appropriate county shall resolve that portion of
the petition that challenges the validity of the judgment of
conviction or sentence and dismiss the remainder of the petition
without prejudice.
Sec. 2. The amendatory provisions of this act do not apply to a
postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to
NRS 34.724 before the effective date of this act.
Sec. 3. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
