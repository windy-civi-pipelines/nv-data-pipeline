Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee of the Executive Department of the State
2 Government who has been employed for not less than 12 consecutive months is
3 entitled to take 8 weeks of paid family leave over a 12-month period, under certain
4 circumstances, to: (1) bond with a newborn child of the employee or a newborn
5 child of the domestic partner of the employee; (2) bond with a newly adopted child
6 of the employee; (3) recover from or undergo treatment for a serious illness; (4)

– 2 –
7 care for a seriously ill member of the immediate family of the employee; or (5)
8 participate in a qualifying event resulting from the military deployment to a foreign
9 country of an immediate family member of the employee. (NRS 284.356) Section 4
10 of this bill: (1) provides such entitlements to officers of the Executive Department
11 of the State Government; (2) decreases the time an employee must be employed to
12 receive the entitlement from 12 consecutive months to 90 days; (3) increases the
13 entitlement from 8 weeks to 12 weeks; (4) entitles an employee to take paid family
14 leave to bond with a newly placed fostered child of the employee, complete any
15 necessary preparatory tasks before the anticipated adoption of a child or placement
16 of a foster child in certain circumstances, to recover from certain serious health
17 conditions, including pregnancy or the loss or end of a pregnancy and for certain
18 purposes resulting from an act of domestic violence, stalking, aggravated stalking,
19 harassment or sexual assault against the employee or an immediate family member
20 of the employee; and (5) revises certain terms relating to paid family leave.
21 Existing law further requires an appointing authority to pay an employee on
22 paid family leave 50 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned
23 if the employee was not on leave. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 instead requires an
24 appointing authority to pay: (1) 100 percent of the regular wage the employee
25 would have earned if the employee was not on leave, if the employee earns not
26 more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage; or (2) 60 percent of the
27 regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not on leave but
28 not more than 150 percent of the state average weekly wage, if the employee earns
29 more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage.
30 Section 4 also: (1) requires an employee to provide certain notice to the
31 appointing authority of the employee’s intent to take paid family leave and make a
32 reasonable effort to take paid family leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt
33 the operations of the appointing authority, in certain circumstances; (2) authorizes
34 the Division of Human Resource Management of the Department of Administration
35 to investigate any instance in which it has reason to believe that an employee has
36 taken paid family leave to which the employee is not entitled, and after notice and a
37 hearing, authorizes the Human Resources Commission to take certain remedial
38 actions; and (3) establishes that paid family leave taken that also meets the
39 requirements for eligibility for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 runs
40 concurrently and authorizes an appointing authority to require any payment made
41 for paid family leave to be made concurrently or otherwise coordinated with certain
42 other policies and agreements. (29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.)
43 Section 7 of this bill establishes substantially similar provisions relating to the
44 entitlement to paid family leave for certain state employees in the public service for
45 employees of private employers and local government employers that have 50 or
46 more employees in private employment in this State, thereby entitling the
47 employees of the private employers to paid family leave.
48 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer
49 and a local government employer to establish reasonable procedures and forms for
50 an employee to take paid family leave, which may not be unduly burdensome to the
51 employee and are required to meet certain language requirements. Sections 2 and 8
52 also require the Commission and Labor Commissioner to establish by regulation
53 the documentation that an employee may be required to provide to an appointing
54 authority, a private employer or a local government employer to take paid family
55 leave, place certain restrictions on the establishment of the regulations and make
56 the documentation confidential.
57 Sections 3 and 9 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer
58 and a local government employer to provide to an employee certain written notice
59 relating to paid family leave in certain circumstances and subject to certain
60 conditions.

61 Section 10 of this bill authorizes an employee of a private employer to bring a
62 civil action, and prescribes the remedies a court is authorized and required to award
63 if an employer fails to take certain actions relating to paid family leave required by
64 section 7.
65 Section 11 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce the
66 provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9, and section 12 of this bill makes a violation of
67 the provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9 a misdemeanor and authorizes the Labor
68 Commissioner to impose, in addition to any other remedy or penalty, a penalty of
69 up to $5,000 for each violation.
70 Section 14 of this bill repeals the provisions in existing law requiring a private
71 employer to provide certain leave to employees relating to domestic violence and
72 sexual assault, as these provisions are supplanted by the provisions of sections 7, 8
73 and 9. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to make a provision
74 prohibiting certain actions relating to the repealed provisions instead apply to
75 section 7.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to employment.
(BDR 23-1027)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 7, 8)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; requiring certain public and
private employers to establish certain procedures and
forms relating to paid family leave; requiring the Human
Resources Commission and Labor Commissioner to
establish certain regulations relating to paid family leave;
requiring certain public and private employers to provide
notice relating to paid family leave; revising provisions
relating to paid family leave for certain state employees
and employees of private employers; repealing certain
provisions relating to leave; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee of the Executive Department of the State
2 Government who has been employed for not less than 12 consecutive months is
3 entitled to take 8 weeks of paid family leave over a 12-month period, under certain
4 circumstances, to: (1) bond with a newborn child of the employee or a newborn
5 child of the domestic partner of the employee; (2) bond with a newly adopted child
6 of the employee; (3) recover from or undergo treatment for a serious illness; (4)
-
*AB388*

– 2 –
7 care for a seriously ill member of the immediate family of the employee; or (5)
8 participate in a qualifying event resulting from the military deployment to a foreign
9 country of an immediate family member of the employee. (NRS 284.356) Section 4
10 of this bill: (1) provides such entitlements to officers of the Executive Department
11 of the State Government; (2) decreases the time an employee must be employed to
12 receive the entitlement from 12 consecutive months to 90 days; (3) increases the
13 entitlement from 8 weeks to 12 weeks; (4) entitles an employee to take paid family
14 leave to bond with a newly placed fostered child of the employee, complete any
15 necessary preparatory tasks before the anticipated adoption of a child or placement
16 of a foster child in certain circumstances, to recover from certain serious health
17 conditions, including pregnancy or the loss or end of a pregnancy and for certain
18 purposes resulting from an act of domestic violence, stalking, aggravated stalking,
19 harassment or sexual assault against the employee or an immediate family member
20 of the employee; and (5) revises certain terms relating to paid family leave.
21 Existing law further requires an appointing authority to pay an employee on
22 paid family leave 50 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned
23 if the employee was not on leave. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 instead requires an
24 appointing authority to pay: (1) 100 percent of the regular wage the employee
25 would have earned if the employee was not on leave, if the employee earns not
26 more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage; or (2) 60 percent of the
27 regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not on leave but
28 not more than 150 percent of the state average weekly wage, if the employee earns
29 more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage.
30 Section 4 also: (1) requires an employee to provide certain notice to the
31 appointing authority of the employee’s intent to take paid family leave and make a
32 reasonable effort to take paid family leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt
33 the operations of the appointing authority, in certain circumstances; (2) authorizes
34 the Division of Human Resource Management of the Department of Administration
35 to investigate any instance in which it has reason to believe that an employee has
36 taken paid family leave to which the employee is not entitled, and after notice and a
37 hearing, authorizes the Human Resources Commission to take certain remedial
38 actions; and (3) establishes that paid family leave taken that also meets the
39 requirements for eligibility for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 runs
40 concurrently and authorizes an appointing authority to require any payment made
41 for paid family leave to be made concurrently or otherwise coordinated with certain
42 other policies and agreements. (29 U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.)
43 Section 7 of this bill establishes substantially similar provisions relating to the
44 entitlement to paid family leave for certain state employees in the public service for
45 employees of private employers and local government employers that have 50 or
46 more employees in private employment in this State, thereby entitling the
47 employees of the private employers to paid family leave.
48 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer
49 and a local government employer to establish reasonable procedures and forms for
50 an employee to take paid family leave, which may not be unduly burdensome to the
51 employee and are required to meet certain language requirements. Sections 2 and 8
52 also require the Commission and Labor Commissioner to establish by regulation
53 the documentation that an employee may be required to provide to an appointing
54 authority, a private employer or a local government employer to take paid family
55 leave, place certain restrictions on the establishment of the regulations and make
56 the documentation confidential.
57 Sections 3 and 9 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer
58 and a local government employer to provide to an employee certain written notice
59 relating to paid family leave in certain circumstances and subject to certain
60 conditions.

– 3 –
61 Section 10 of this bill authorizes an employee of a private employer to bring a
62 civil action, and prescribes the remedies a court is authorized and required to award
63 if an employer fails to take certain actions relating to paid family leave required by
64 section 7.
65 Section 11 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce the
66 provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9, and section 12 of this bill makes a violation of
67 the provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9 a misdemeanor and authorizes the Labor
68 Commissioner to impose, in addition to any other remedy or penalty, a penalty of
69 up to $5,000 for each violation.
70 Section 14 of this bill repeals the provisions in existing law requiring a private
71 employer to provide certain leave to employees relating to domestic violence and
72 sexual assault, as these provisions are supplanted by the provisions of sections 7, 8
73 and 9. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to make a provision
74 prohibiting certain actions relating to the repealed provisions instead apply to
75 section 7.

6. An employer shall maintain a record of the hours of leave
taken pursuant to this section for each employee for a 2-year period
following the entry of such information in the record and, upon
request, shall make those records available for inspection by the
Labor Commissioner. The employer shall exclude the names of the
employees from the records, unless a request for a record is for
