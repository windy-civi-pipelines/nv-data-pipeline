AN ACT relating to employment; requiring certain public and private employers to
establish certain procedures and forms relating to paid family leave;
requiring the Human Resources Commission and Labor Commissioner
to establish certain regulations relating to paid family leave; requiring
certain public and private employers to provide notice relating to paid
family leave; revising provisions relating to paid family leave for
certain state employees and employees of private employers; repealing
certain provisions relating to leave; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee of the Executive Department of the State Government
2 who has been employed for not less than 12 consecutive months is entitled to take 8 weeks of
3 paid family leave over a 12-month period, under certain circumstances, to: (1) bond with a
4 newborn child of the employee or a newborn child of the domestic partner of the employee;
5 (2) bond with a newly adopted child of the employee; (3) recover from or undergo treatment
6 for a serious illness; (4) care for a seriously ill member of the immediate family of the
7 employee; or (5) participate in a qualifying event resulting from the military deployment to a
8 foreign country of an immediate family member of the employee. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 of
9 this bill: (1) provides such entitlements to officers of the Executive Department of the State
10 Government; (2) decreases the time an employee must be employed to receive the entitlement
11 from 12 consecutive months to 90 days; (3) increases the entitlement from 8 weeks to 12
12 weeks; (4) entitles an employee to take paid family leave to bond with a newly placed foster
13 child of the employee, complete any necessary preparatory tasks before the anticipated
14 adoption of a child or placement of a foster child in certain circumstances, to recover from
15 certain serious health conditions, including pregnancy or the loss or end of a pregnancy and
Assembly Amendment No. 857 to Assembly Bill No. 388 Page 4
16 for certain purposes resulting from an act of domestic violence, stalking, aggravated stalking,
17 harassment or sexual assault against the employee or an immediate family member of the
18 employee; and (5) revises certain terms relating to paid family leave.
19 Existing law further requires an appointing authority to pay an employee on paid family
20 leave 50 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not
21 on leave. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 instead requires an appointing authority to pay: (1) 100
22 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not on
23 leave, if the employee earns not more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage; or
24 (2) 60 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not
25 on leave but not more than 150 percent of the state average weekly wage, if the employee
26 earns more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage.
27 Section 4 also: (1) requires an employee to provide certain notice to the appointing
28 authority of the employee’s intent to take paid family leave and make a reasonable effort to
29 take paid family leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
30 appointing authority, in certain circumstances; (2) authorizes the Division of Human Resource
31 Management of the Department of Administration to investigate any instance in which it has
32 reason to believe that an employee has taken paid family leave to which the employee is not
33 entitled, and after notice and a hearing, authorizes the Human Resources Commission to take
34 certain remedial actions; and (3) establishes that paid family leave taken that also meets the
35 requirements for eligibility for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 runs concurrently
36 and authorizes an appointing authority to require any payment made for paid family leave to
37 be made concurrently or otherwise coordinated with certain other policies and agreements. (29
38 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq.)
39 Section 7 of this bill establishes substantially similar provisions relating to the
40 entitlement to paid family leave for certain state employees in the public service for
41 employees of private employers and local government employers that have 50 or more
42 employees in private employment in this State, thereby entitling the employees of the private
43 employers to paid family leave.
44 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer and a
45 local government employer to establish reasonable procedures and forms for an employee to
46 take paid family leave, which may not be unduly burdensome to the employee and are
47 required to meet certain language requirements. Sections 2 and 8 also require the
48 Commission and Labor Commissioner to establish by regulation the documentation that an
49 employee may be required to provide to an appointing authority, a private employer or a local
50 government employer to take paid family leave, place certain restrictions on the establishment
51 of the regulations and make the documentation confidential.
52 Sections 3 and 9 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer and a
53 local government employer to provide to an employee certain written notice relating to paid
54 family leave in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions.
55 Section 10 of this bill authorizes an employee to bring a civil action, and prescribes the
56 remedies a court is authorized and required to award if an employer fails to take certain
57 actions relating to paid family leave required by section 7.
58 Section 11 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce the provisions of
59 sections 7, 8 and 9, and section 12 of this bill makes a violation of the provisions of sections
60 7, 8 and 9 a misdemeanor and authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose, in addition to
61 any other remedy or penalty, a penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation.
62 Section 14 of this bill repeals the provisions in existing law requiring a private employer
63 to provide certain leave to employees relating to domestic violence and sexual assault, as
64 these provisions are supplanted by the provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9. Section 13 of this
65 bill makes a conforming change to make a provision prohibiting certain actions relating to the
66 repealed provisions instead apply to section 7.

31 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
32 record that is not otherwise confidential.
33 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record

37 (a) The public record:
38 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
39 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
40 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
41 electronic medium would:

43 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
44 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
45 otherwise confidential.
46 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
47 custody or control of a public record:

50 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
51 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
52 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the

29 earned if the employee was not on leave, if the employee earns not more than 110
30 percent of the state average weekly wage; or
31 (b) Sixty percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the
32 employee was not on leave but not more than 150 percent of the state average

43 provisions of this section in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations
44 of the employer, if the paid family leave is taken for events that are foreseeable to
45 the employee.
46 6. An employer shall not deny an eligible employee the right to take paid
47 family leave in accordance with the provisions of this section or retaliate or take

50 section.
51 7. The Labor Commissioner may investigate any instance in which he or
52 she has reason to believe that an employee has taken paid family leave to which

Assembly Amendment No. 857 to Assembly Bill No. 388 Page 12
1 Labor Commissioner determines that the employee has taken paid family leave to
2 which the employee was not entitled, the Labor Commissioner may take any of
3 the following actions:
4 (a) Direct the employer to seek repayment of funds relating to the paid family
5 leave; or
6 (b) Disqualify the employee from paid family leave benefits for a period not

9 and that meets the requirements for eligibility for the Family and Medical Leave

19 party.

CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 7, 8)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; requiring certain public and private employers to
establish certain procedures and forms relating to paid family leave;
requiring the Human Resources Commission and Labor Commissioner
to establish certain regulations relating to paid family leave; requiring
certain public and private employers to provide notice relating to paid
family leave; revising provisions relating to paid family leave for
certain state employees and employees of private employers; repealing
certain provisions relating to leave; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an employee of the Executive Department of the State Government
2 who has been employed for not less than 12 consecutive months is entitled to take 8 weeks of
3 paid family leave over a 12-month period, under certain circumstances, to: (1) bond with a
4 newborn child of the employee or a newborn child of the domestic partner of the employee;
5 (2) bond with a newly adopted child of the employee; (3) recover from or undergo treatment
6 for a serious illness; (4) care for a seriously ill member of the immediate family of the
7 employee; or (5) participate in a qualifying event resulting from the military deployment to a
8 foreign country of an immediate family member of the employee. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 of
9 this bill: (1) provides such entitlements to officers of the Executive Department of the State
10 Government; (2) decreases the time an employee must be employed to receive the entitlement
11 from 12 consecutive months to 90 days; (3) increases the entitlement from 8 weeks to 12
12 weeks; (4) entitles an employee to take paid family leave to bond with a newly placed foster
13 child of the employee, complete any necessary preparatory tasks before the anticipated
14 adoption of a child or placement of a foster child in certain circumstances, to recover from
15 certain serious health conditions, including pregnancy or the loss or end of a pregnancy and

Assembly Amendment No. 857 to Assembly Bill No. 388 Page 4
16 for certain purposes resulting from an act of domestic violence, stalking, aggravated stalking,
17 harassment or sexual assault against the employee or an immediate family member of the
18 employee; and (5) revises certain terms relating to paid family leave.
19 Existing law further requires an appointing authority to pay an employee on paid family
20 leave 50 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not
21 on leave. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 instead requires an appointing authority to pay: (1) 100
22 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not on
23 leave, if the employee earns not more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage; or
24 (2) 60 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not
25 on leave but not more than 150 percent of the state average weekly wage, if the employee
26 earns more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage.
27 Section 4 also: (1) requires an employee to provide certain notice to the appointing
28 authority of the employee’s intent to take paid family leave and make a reasonable effort to
29 take paid family leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
30 appointing authority, in certain circumstances; (2) authorizes the Division of Human Resource
31 Management of the Department of Administration to investigate any instance in which it has
32 reason to believe that an employee has taken paid family leave to which the employee is not
33 entitled, and after notice and a hearing, authorizes the Human Resources Commission to take
34 certain remedial actions; and (3) establishes that paid family leave taken that also meets the
35 requirements for eligibility for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 runs concurrently
36 and authorizes an appointing authority to require any payment made for paid family leave to
37 be made concurrently or otherwise coordinated with certain other policies and agreements. (29
38 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq.)
39 Section 7 of this bill establishes substantially similar provisions relating to the
40 entitlement to paid family leave for certain state employees in the public service for
41 employees of private employers and local government employers that have 50 or more
42 employees in private employment in this State, thereby entitling the employees of the private
43 employers to paid family leave.
44 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer and a
45 local government employer to establish reasonable procedures and forms for an employee to
46 take paid family leave, which may not be unduly burdensome to the employee and are
47 required to meet certain language requirements. Sections 2 and 8 also require the
48 Commission and Labor Commissioner to establish by regulation the documentation that an
49 employee may be required to provide to an appointing authority, a private employer or a local
50 government employer to take paid family leave, place certain restrictions on the establishment
51 of the regulations and make the documentation confidential.
52 Sections 3 and 9 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer and a
53 local government employer to provide to an employee certain written notice relating to paid
54 family leave in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions.
55 Section 10 of this bill authorizes an employee to bring a civil action, and prescribes the
56 remedies a court is authorized and required to award if an employer fails to take certain
57 actions relating to paid family leave required by section 7.
58 Section 11 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce the provisions of
59 sections 7, 8 and 9, and section 12 of this bill makes a violation of the provisions of sections
60 7, 8 and 9 a misdemeanor and authorizes the Labor Commissioner to impose, in addition to
61 any other remedy or penalty, a penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation.
62 Section 14 of this bill repeals the provisions in existing law requiring a private employer
63 to provide certain leave to employees relating to domestic violence and sexual assault, as
64 these provisions are supplanted by the provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9. Section 13 of this
65 bill makes a conforming change to make a provision prohibiting certain actions relating to the
66 repealed provisions instead apply to section 7.

1 Labor Commissioner determines that the employee has taken paid family leave to
2 which the employee was not entitled, the Labor Commissioner may take any of
3 the following actions:
