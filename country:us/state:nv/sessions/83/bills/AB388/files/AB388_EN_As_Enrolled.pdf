CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to employment; requiring certain public and
private employers to establish certain procedures and forms
relating to paid family leave; requiring the Human Resources
Commission and Labor Commissioner to establish certain
regulations relating to paid family leave; requiring certain
public and private employers to provide notice relating to
paid family leave; revising provisions relating to paid family
leave for certain state employees and employees of private
employers; repealing certain provisions relating to leave;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, an employee of the Executive Department of the State
Government who has been employed for not less than 12 consecutive months is
entitled to take 8 weeks of paid family leave over a 12-month period, under certain
circumstances, to: (1) bond with a newborn child of the employee or a newborn
child of the domestic partner of the employee; (2) bond with a newly adopted child
of the employee; (3) recover from or undergo treatment for a serious illness; (4)
care for a seriously ill member of the immediate family of the employee; or (5)
participate in a qualifying event resulting from the military deployment to a foreign
country of an immediate family member of the employee. (NRS 284.356) Section 4
of this bill: (1) provides such entitlements to officers of the Executive Department
of the State Government; (2) decreases the time an employee must be employed to
receive the entitlement from 12 consecutive months to 90 days; (3) increases the
entitlement from 8 weeks to 12 weeks; (4) entitles an employee to take paid family
leave to bond with a newly placed foster child of the employee, complete any
necessary preparatory tasks before the anticipated adoption of a child or placement
of a foster child in certain circumstances, to recover from certain serious health
conditions, including pregnancy or the loss or end of a pregnancy and for certain
purposes resulting from an act of domestic violence, stalking, aggravated stalking,
harassment or sexual assault against the employee or an immediate family member
of the employee; and (5) revises certain terms relating to paid family leave.
Existing law further requires an appointing authority to pay an employee on
paid family leave 50 percent of the regular wage the employee would have earned
if the employee was not on leave. (NRS 284.356) Section 4 instead requires an
appointing authority to pay: (1) 100 percent of the regular wage the employee
would have earned if the employee was not on leave, if the employee earns not
more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage; or (2) 60 percent of the
regular wage the employee would have earned if the employee was not on leave but
not more than 150 percent of the state average weekly wage, if the employee earns
more than 110 percent of the state average weekly wage.

Section 4 also: (1) requires an employee to provide certain notice to the
appointing authority of the employee’s intent to take paid family leave and make a
reasonable effort to take paid family leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt
the operations of the appointing authority, in certain circumstances; (2) authorizes
the Division of Human Resource Management of the Department of Administration
to investigate any instance in which it has reason to believe that an employee has
taken paid family leave to which the employee is not entitled, and after notice and a
hearing, authorizes the Human Resources Commission to take certain remedial
actions; and (3) establishes that paid family leave taken that also meets the
requirements for eligibility for the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 runs
concurrently and authorizes an appointing authority to require any payment made
for paid family leave to be made concurrently or otherwise coordinated with certain
other policies and agreements. (29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq.)
Section 7 of this bill establishes substantially similar provisions relating to the
entitlement to paid family leave for certain state employees in the public service for
employees of private employers and local government employers that have 50 or
more employees in private employment in this State, thereby entitling the
employees of the private employers to paid family leave.
Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer
and a local government employer to establish reasonable procedures and forms for
an employee to take paid family leave, which may not be unduly burdensome to the
employee and are required to meet certain language requirements. Sections 2 and 8
also require the Commission and Labor Commissioner to establish by regulation
the documentation that an employee may be required to provide to an appointing
authority, a private employer or a local government employer to take paid family
leave, place certain restrictions on the establishment of the regulations and make
the documentation confidential.
Sections 3 and 9 of this bill require an appointing authority, a private employer
and a local government employer to provide to an employee certain written notice
relating to paid family leave in certain circumstances and subject to certain
conditions.
Section 10 of this bill authorizes an employee to bring a civil action, and
prescribes the remedies a court is authorized and required to award if an employer
fails to take certain actions relating to paid family leave required by section 7.
Section 11 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to enforce the
provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9, and section 12 of this bill makes a violation of
the provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9 a misdemeanor and authorizes the Labor
Commissioner to impose, in addition to any other remedy or penalty, a penalty of
up to $5,000 for each violation.
Section 14 of this bill repeals the provisions in existing law requiring a private
employer to provide certain leave to employees relating to domestic violence and
sexual assault, as these provisions are supplanted by the provisions of sections 7, 8
and 9. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to make a provision
prohibiting certain actions relating to the repealed provisions instead apply to
section 7.
