EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; exempting certain offices of
physicians or other health care facilities that administer
anesthesia or sedation to dental patients from certain
requirements to obtain a permit to provide anesthesia or
sedation; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires an office of a physician and certain other facilities
2 providing health care to obtain a permit from the Division of Public and Behavioral
3 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services before offering general
4 anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation. (NRS 449.442) Existing law also
5 requires a dentist to obtain a permit from the Board of Dental Examiners before
6 offering general anesthesia, minimal sedation, moderate sedation or deep sedation.
7 (NRS 631.265) Existing law defines “minimal sedation” and “moderate sedation”
8 to encompass the types of sedation which constitute conscious sedation. (NRS
9 449.436, 631.078, 631.079) Consequently, existing law requires a person who
10 holds both a license as a physician and a license as a dentist to obtain two permits
11 to offer general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation. (NRS 449.441,
12 631.265)
13 This bill exempts an office of a physician or a facility that provides health care,
14 other than a medical facility, from the requirement to obtain a permit from the
15 Division if the office only administers general anesthesia, deep sedation or
16 conscious sedation to dental patients and the administration is performed by a
17 physician who: (1) is also licensed to practice dentistry; (2) holds a permit issued
18 by the Board to administer general anesthesia, minimal sedation, moderate sedation
19 or deep sedation to dental patients; and (3) administers general anesthesia or
20 sedation of any type only within the scope of that permit. This bill thereby

21 eliminates the requirement that a person who is licensed as both a physician and a
22 dentist obtain two permits to offer general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep
23 sedation.
