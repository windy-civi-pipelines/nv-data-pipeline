Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; exempting certain offices of
physicians or other health care facilities that administer
anesthesia or sedation to dental patients from certain
requirements to obtain a permit to provide anesthesia or
sedation; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires an office of a physician and certain other facilities
providing health care to obtain a permit from the Division of Public and Behavioral
Health of the Department of Health and Human Services before offering general
anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation. (NRS 449.442) Existing law also
requires a dentist to obtain a permit from the Board of Dental Examiners before
offering general anesthesia, minimal sedation, moderate sedation or deep sedation.
(NRS 631.265) Existing law defines “minimal sedation” and “moderate sedation”
to encompass the types of sedation which constitute conscious sedation. (NRS

Section 2:
449.436, 631.078, 631.079) Consequently, existing law requires a person who
holds both a license as a physician and a license as a dentist to obtain two permits
to offer general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation. (NRS 449.441,

Section 3:
631.265)
This bill exempts an office of a physician or a facility that provides health care,
other than a medical facility, from the requirement to obtain a permit from the
Division if the office only administers general anesthesia, deep sedation or
conscious sedation to dental patients and the administration is performed by a
physician who: (1) is also licensed to practice dentistry; (2) holds a permit issued
by the Board to administer general anesthesia, minimal sedation, moderate sedation
or deep sedation to dental patients; and (3) administers general anesthesia or
sedation of any type only within the scope of that permit. This bill thereby
eliminates the requirement that a person who is licensed as both a physician and a
dentist obtain two permits to offer general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep
sedation.
