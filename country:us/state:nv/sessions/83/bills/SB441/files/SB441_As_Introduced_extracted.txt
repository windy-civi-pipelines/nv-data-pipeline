SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to drivers who enter into
an agreement with a transportation network
company. (BDR 58-1032)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to transportation; removing and revising
provisions relating to drivers who enter into an agreement
with a transportation network company; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person who drives a motor vehicle for a taxicab motor
2 carrier to have a driver’s permit issued by the Nevada Transportation Authority.
3 Among other requirements, to obtain such a driver’s permit an applicant must: (1)
4 submit an application, which includes the fingerprints of the applicant for the
5 purposes of conducting a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background
6 check; and (2) pay, upon both the initial issuance and renewal, a fee not to exceed
7 $50 and the cost for processing the fingerprints. (NRS 706.462)
8 Contrastingly, existing law: (1) authorizes a transportation network company to
9 enter into an agreement with one or more drivers to receive connections to potential
10 passengers from the company in exchange for the payment of a fee by the driver to
11 the company; (2) establishes certain minimum qualifications for drivers of a
12 transportation network company; and (3) requires a transportation network
13 company to conduct a background check of each driver, which must include an
14 investigation of the criminal history of the driver, a search of a database containing
15 information available from the sex offender registry maintained by each state and a
16 review of the driving history of the driver. (NRS 706A.160)
17 Section 3 of this bill removes the provisions of existing law governing the
18 minimum qualifications and background checks for drivers who enter into
19 agreements with a transportation network company and instead makes such drivers
20 subject to the requirements applicable to persons who drive a motor vehicle for a
21 taxicab motor carrier. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to
22 indicate that for the purposes of application, investigation and qualification, a driver
23 who enters into an agreement with a transportation network company is subject to
-
*SB441*
– 2 –
24 the same provisions in existing law as those governing persons who drive a motor
25 vehicle for a taxicab motor carrier.
