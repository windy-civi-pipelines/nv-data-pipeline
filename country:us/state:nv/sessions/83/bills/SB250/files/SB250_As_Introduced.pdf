(BDR 40-70)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 3, 8, 12, 15)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; providing that the electronic health
records of a patient are the property of the patient;
requiring certain entities to allow a patient to take certain
actions relating to access to his or her electronic health
records; requiring the establishment of a statewide
electronic health repository; imposing certain
requirements relating to the statewide electronic health
repository; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes various requirements governing health information
2 technology and the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic
3 health records and certain other electronic health information. (NRS 439.581-
4 439.597) Upon the request of a person who is authorized to request a copy of health
5 records that are maintained electronically, existing law requires a custodian of
6 health care records to electronically transmit a copy of the health records to any
7 person or entity for a fee. (NRS 629.062) Section 3 of this bill provides that the
8 electronic health records of a patient are the property of the patient and requires a
9 health care provider to allow a patient to: (1) access and forward his or her
10 electronic health records without a fee or charge; and (2) request that his or her
11 electronic health records be forwarded to any other person or entity in accordance
12 with existing law. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a
13 requirement that the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
14 adopt regulations governing the ownership of electronic health records because
15 section 3 establishes that such records are the property of the patient.

16 With certain exceptions, existing law requires a health care provider, health
17 insurer, health insurance administrator and certain other entities to authorize a
18 person to opt out of having his or her individually identifiable health information
19 disclosed electronically to health care providers, insurers and certain other entities.
20 (NRS 439.597) Section 10 of this bill requires those persons and entities to allow a
21 patient to prohibit any person or entity from accessing his or her individually
22 identifiable health information, with similar exceptions. Section 5 of this bill makes
23 a violation of section 3 or 10, or any regulations adopted to carry out those
24 sections, a misdemeanor. A health care provider, health insurer or health insurance
25 administrator that commits such a violation would also be subject to administrative
26 sanctions. (NRS 439.589, 439.5895, 449.167, 450B.215, 629.051, 680A.225,
27 683A.0891, 695C.329)
28 Existing law requires the Director to adopt regulations that prescribe a
29 framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic
30 health records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures.
31 Existing law requires state and local governmental entities, health care providers
32 and insurers and certain related entities to maintain, transmit and exchange health
33 information in accordance with that framework, with certain exceptions. (NRS
34 439.589) Existing law establishes that physician group practices and other business
35 entities organized for the purpose of practicing a health care profession with 20 or
36 fewer employees are not required to comply with those provisions until January 1,
37 2030. (Section 2.8 of chapter 278, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1859) Section
38 4 of this bill requires the Director to: (1) establish a statewide electronic health
39 repository for storing the electronic health records of all patients in this State; and
40 (2) adopt regulations to establish a standardized procedure for collecting
41 information from patients and entering the information into the computerized
42 system that serves as a platform for the repository. Section 2 of this bill defines the
43 term “electronic health repository.” Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide that
44 electronic health records in the statewide electronic health repository are
45 confidential, with certain exceptions. Section 8 requires each health care provider
46 in this State that is not exempt from the requirement to maintain, transmit and
47 exchange electronic health records to: (1) integrate the system used by the health
48 care provider for the maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information
49 with the statewide electronic health repository; and (2) comply with the
50 standardized procedure established by the Director for collecting patient
51 information and entering patient information into the repository. Section 15 of this
52 bill makes a conforming change related to the requirement for electronic health care
53 records to be integrated into the statewide electronic health repository. Section 17
54 of this bill establishes that physician group practices and other business entities
55 organized for the purpose of practicing a health care profession with 20 or fewer
56 employees are not required to comply with the requirements of section 8 until
57 January 1, 2030. A health care provider who fails to comply with those
58 requirements would be subject to administrative sanctions but would not be guilty
59 of a misdemeanor. (NRS 439.589, 439.5895, 449.167, 450B.215, 629.051)
60 Sections 5, 7, 9, 10, 12-14 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1)
61 clarify the applicability of sections 3 and 4 and certain provisions of existing law;
62 and (2) indicate the proper placement of sections 2-4 in the Nevada Revised
63 Statutes.
