~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain entities to allow a
patient to take certain actions relating to access to his or
her electronic health records; requiring the adoption of
regulations to minimize the need for a patient to
repeatedly provide certain information; providing that the
health records of a patient are the property of a patient;
requiring the Director of the Department of Health and
Human Services to compile certain reports; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes various requirements governing health information
2 technology and the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic
3 health records and certain other electronic health information. (NRS 439.581-
4 439.597) Upon the request of a person who is authorized to request a copy of health
5 records that are maintained electronically, existing law requires a custodian of
6 health care records to electronically transmit a copy of the health records to any
7 person or entity for a fee. (NRS 629.062) Section 15 of this bill provides that the
8 health care records of a patient are the property of the patient, and section 3 of this
9 bill requires a health care provider to allow a patient to: (1) access and forward his
10 or her electronic health records without a fee or charge; and (2) request that his or
11 her electronic health records be forwarded to any other person or entity in
12 accordance with existing law. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to
13 remove a requirement that the Director of the Department of Health and Human
-
*SB250_R1*

– 2 –
14 Services adopt regulations governing the ownership of electronic health records
15 because section 15 establishes that such records are the property of the patient.
16 With certain exceptions, existing law requires a health care provider, health
17 insurer, health insurance administrator and certain other entities to authorize a
18 person to opt out of having his or her individually identifiable health information
19 disclosed electronically to health care providers, insurers and certain other entities.
20 (NRS 439.597) Section 10 of this bill requires those persons and entities to allow a
21 patient to prohibit any person or entity from accessing his or her individually
22 identifiable health information, with similar exceptions. Section 5 of this bill makes
23 a violation of section 3 or 10, or any regulations adopted to carry out those
24 sections, a misdemeanor. A health care provider, health insurer or health insurance
25 administrator that commits such a violation would also be subject to administrative
26 sanctions. (NRS 439.589, 439.5895, 449.167, 450B.215, 629.051, 680A.225,
27 683A.0891, 695C.329)
28 Existing law requires the Director to adopt regulations that prescribe a
29 framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic
30 health records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures.
31 Existing law requires state and local governmental entities, health care providers
32 and insurers and certain related entities to maintain, transmit and exchange health
33 information in accordance with that framework, with certain exceptions. (NRS
34 439.589) Existing law establishes that physician group practices and other business
35 entities organized for the purpose of practicing a health care profession with 20 or
36 fewer employees are not required to comply with those provisions until January 1,
37 2030. (Section 2.8 of chapter 278, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1859) Section
38 8 requires the regulations adopted by the Director to include requirements to
39 minimize the need for a patient to repeatedly provide demographic information,
40 information relating to his or her medical history and the list of medications that the
41 patient is currently taking or has taken in the past. A health care provider who fails
42 to comply with those regulations would be subject to administrative sanctions but
43 would not be guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 439.589, 439.5895, 449.167,
44 450B.215, 629.051) Sections 5-7, 9, 10, 12-14 and 16 of this bill make conforming
45 changes to: (1) clarify the applicability of section 3 and certain provisions of
46 existing law; and (2) indicate the proper placement of section 3 in the Nevada
47 Revised Statutes. During the 2026 calendar year, section 16.5 of this bill requires
48 the Director of the Department to publish and submit to the Governor and the
49 Legislature a quarterly report concerning the progress of the Department toward
50 implementing the provisions of this bill. Section 16.5 also requires the Director or
51 his or her designee to appear before the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
52 Health and Human Services or the Legislative Commission upon request to provide
53 information concerning the reports.

30 patient that the health care records of the patient may be destroyed
31 after the period set forth in subsection 1.
32 4. If a provider of health care fails to deliver the written

36 performs health care services for the patient.

12 licensing board may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing
13 in accordance with the provisions of this title, require corrective
14 action or impose an administrative penalty in an amount not to
15 exceed the maximum penalty that the health care licensing board is
16 authorized to impose for other violations. The health care licensing
17 board shall not suspend or revoke a license for failure to comply
18 with the requirements of subsection 4 of NRS 439.589.
