EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; [providing that the electronic health records of a
patient are the property of the patient;] requiring certain entities to
allow a patient to take certain actions relating to access to his or her
electronic health records; [requiring the establishment of a statewide
electronic health repository; imposing certain requirements relating to
the statewide electronic health repository;] requiring the adoption of
regulations to minimize the need for a patient to repeatedly
provide certain information; providing that the health records of a
patient are the property of a patient; requiring the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to compile certain
reports; providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes various requirements governing health information technology
2 and the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records and
3 certain other electronic health information. (NRS 439.581-439.597) Upon the request of a
4 person who is authorized to request a copy of health records that are maintained
5 electronically, existing law requires a custodian of health care records to electronically
6 transmit a copy of the health records to any person or entity for a fee. (NRS 629.062) Section
7 [3] 15 of this bill provides that the [electronic] health care records of a patient are the property
8 of the patient , and section 3 of this bill requires a health care provider to allow a patient to:
9 (1) access and forward his or her electronic health records without a fee or charge; and (2)
10 request that his or her electronic health records be forwarded to any other person or entity in
11 accordance with existing law. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a
12 requirement that the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services adopt
13 regulations governing the ownership of electronic health records because section [3] 15
14 establishes that such records are the property of the patient.
15 With certain exceptions, existing law requires a health care provider, health insurer,
16 health insurance administrator and certain other entities to authorize a person to opt out of
17 having his or her individually identifiable health information disclosed electronically to health
Senate Amendment No. 353 to Senate Bill No. 250 Page 4
18 care providers, insurers and certain other entities. (NRS 439.597) Section 10 of this bill
19 requires those persons and entities to allow a patient to prohibit any person or entity from
20 accessing his or her individually identifiable health information, with similar exceptions.
21 Section 5 of this bill makes a violation of section 3 or 10, or any regulations adopted to carry
22 out those sections, a misdemeanor. A health care provider, health insurer or health insurance
23 administrator that commits such a violation would also be subject to administrative sanctions.
24 (NRS 439.589, 439.5895, 449.167, 450B.215, 629.051, 680A.225, 683A.0891, 695C.329)
25 Existing law requires the Director to adopt regulations that prescribe a framework for the
26 electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions,
27 health-related information and electronic signatures. Existing law requires state and local
28 governmental entities, health care providers and insurers and certain related entities to
29 maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance with that framework, with
30 certain exceptions. (NRS 439.589) Existing law establishes that physician group practices and
31 other business entities organized for the purpose of practicing a health care profession with 20
32 or fewer employees are not required to comply with those provisions until January 1, 2030.
33 (Section 2.8 of chapter 278, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1859) Section [4 of this bill
34 requires the Director to: (1) establish a statewide electronic health repository for storing the
35 electronic health records of all patients in this State; and (2) adopt regulations to establish a
36 standardized procedure for collecting information from patients and entering the information
37 into the computerized system that serves as a platform for the repository. Section 2 of this bill
38 defines the term “electronic health repository.” Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide that
39 electronic health records in the statewide electronic health repository are confidential, with
40 certain exceptions. Section 8 requires each health care provider in this State that is not exempt
41 from the requirement to maintain, transmit and exchange electronic health records to: (1)
42 integrate the system used by the health care provider for the maintenance, transmittal and
43 exchange of health information with the statewide electronic health repository; and (2) comply
44 with the standardized procedure established by the Director for collecting patient information
45 and entering patient information into the repository. Section 15 of this bill makes a
46 conforming change related to the requirement for electronic health care records to be
47 integrated into the statewide electronic health repository. Section 17 of this bill establishes
48 that physician group practices and other business entities organized for the purpose of
49 practicing a health care profession with 20 or fewer employees are not required to comply
50 with the requirements of section 8 until January 1, 2030.] 8 requires the regulations adopted
51 by the Director to include requirements to minimize the need for a patient to repeatedly
52 provide demographic information, information relating to his or her medical history and
53 the list of medications that the patient is currently taking or has taken in the past. A
54 health care provider who fails to comply with those [requirements] regulations would be
55 subject to administrative sanctions but would not be guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 439.589,
56 439.5895, 449.167, 450B.215, 629.051) Sections 5-7, 9, 10, 12-14 and 16 of this bill make
57 conforming changes to: (1) clarify the applicability of [sections 3 and 4] section 3 and certain
58 provisions of existing law; and (2) indicate the proper placement of [sections 2-4] section 3 in
59 the Nevada Revised Statutes. During the 2026 calendar year, section 16.5 of this bill
60 requires the Director of the Department to publish and submit to the Governor and the
61 Legislature a quarterly report concerning the progress of the Department toward
62 implementing the provisions of this bill. Section 16.5 also requires the Director or his or
63 her designee to appear before the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
64 Human Services or the Legislative Commission upon request to provide information
65 concerning the reports.

7 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
8 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
9 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
10 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
11 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
12 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
13 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
14 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
15 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
16 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
17 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
18 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

26 record that is not otherwise confidential.
27 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
28 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
29 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
30 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
31 (a) The public record:
32 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
33 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
34 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
35 electronic medium would:
36 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
37 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
38 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
39 otherwise confidential.
40 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
41 custody or control of a public record:
42 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
43 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
44 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
45 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
46 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
47 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.] (Deleted by amendment.)

53 insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its officers and employees,
Senate Amendment No. 353 to Senate Bill No. 250 Page 12

3 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the insurance.
4 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance, or any
5 combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and employees, and the

11 (c) Provide group life, accident or health coverage through a self-insurance
12 reserve fund and, where necessary, deduct contributions to the maintenance of the

31 employees of the governing body, or the dependents of such officers and
32 employees.
33 (d) Defray part or all of the cost of maintenance of a self-insurance fund or of

36 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
37 agency of the State of Nevada.
38 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and employees
39 pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees of the school district must
40 not be excluded from participating in the group insurance. If the amount of the
41 deductions from compensation required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the
42 compensation to which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the
43 trustee.
44 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists, the governing
45 body of the county, or of any school district, municipal corporation, political
46 subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental agency of the State of
47 Nevada in the county, may enter into a contract with the legal services organization

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; [providing that the electronic health records of a
patient are the property of the patient;] requiring certain entities to
allow a patient to take certain actions relating to access to his or her
electronic health records; [requiring the establishment of a statewide
electronic health repository; imposing certain requirements relating to
the statewide electronic health repository;] requiring the adoption of
regulations to minimize the need for a patient to repeatedly
provide certain information; providing that the health records of a
patient are the property of a patient; requiring the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to compile certain
reports; providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes various requirements governing health information technology
2 and the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records and
3 certain other electronic health information. (NRS 439.581-439.597) Upon the request of a
4 person who is authorized to request a copy of health records that are maintained
5 electronically, existing law requires a custodian of health care records to electronically
6 transmit a copy of the health records to any person or entity for a fee. (NRS 629.062) Section
7 [3] 15 of this bill provides that the [electronic] health care records of a patient are the property
8 of the patient , and section 3 of this bill requires a health care provider to allow a patient to:
9 (1) access and forward his or her electronic health records without a fee or charge; and (2)
10 request that his or her electronic health records be forwarded to any other person or entity in
11 accordance with existing law. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a
12 requirement that the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services adopt
13 regulations governing the ownership of electronic health records because section [3] 15
14 establishes that such records are the property of the patient.
15 With certain exceptions, existing law requires a health care provider, health insurer,
16 health insurance administrator and certain other entities to authorize a person to opt out of
17 having his or her individually identifiable health information disclosed electronically to health

Senate Amendment No. 353 to Senate Bill No. 250 Page 4
18 care providers, insurers and certain other entities. (NRS 439.597) Section 10 of this bill
19 requires those persons and entities to allow a patient to prohibit any person or entity from
20 accessing his or her individually identifiable health information, with similar exceptions.
21 Section 5 of this bill makes a violation of section 3 or 10, or any regulations adopted to carry
22 out those sections, a misdemeanor. A health care provider, health insurer or health insurance
23 administrator that commits such a violation would also be subject to administrative sanctions.
24 (NRS 439.589, 439.5895, 449.167, 450B.215, 629.051, 680A.225, 683A.0891, 695C.329)
25 Existing law requires the Director to adopt regulations that prescribe a framework for the
26 electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions,
27 health-related information and electronic signatures. Existing law requires state and local
28 governmental entities, health care providers and insurers and certain related entities to
29 maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance with that framework, with
30 certain exceptions. (NRS 439.589) Existing law establishes that physician group practices and
31 other business entities organized for the purpose of practicing a health care profession with 20
32 or fewer employees are not required to comply with those provisions until January 1, 2030.
33 (Section 2.8 of chapter 278, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1859) Section [4 of this bill
34 requires the Director to: (1) establish a statewide electronic health repository for storing the
35 electronic health records of all patients in this State; and (2) adopt regulations to establish a
36 standardized procedure for collecting information from patients and entering the information
37 into the computerized system that serves as a platform for the repository. Section 2 of this bill
38 defines the term “electronic health repository.” Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide that
39 electronic health records in the statewide electronic health repository are confidential, with
40 certain exceptions. Section 8 requires each health care provider in this State that is not exempt
41 from the requirement to maintain, transmit and exchange electronic health records to: (1)
42 integrate the system used by the health care provider for the maintenance, transmittal and
43 exchange of health information with the statewide electronic health repository; and (2) comply
44 with the standardized procedure established by the Director for collecting patient information
45 and entering patient information into the repository. Section 15 of this bill makes a
46 conforming change related to the requirement for electronic health care records to be
47 integrated into the statewide electronic health repository. Section 17 of this bill establishes
48 that physician group practices and other business entities organized for the purpose of
49 practicing a health care profession with 20 or fewer employees are not required to comply
50 with the requirements of section 8 until January 1, 2030.] 8 requires the regulations adopted
51 by the Director to include requirements to minimize the need for a patient to repeatedly
52 provide demographic information, information relating to his or her medical history and
53 the list of medications that the patient is currently taking or has taken in the past. A

8 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
9 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
10 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
11 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

26 record that is not otherwise confidential.

32 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
33 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
34 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
35 electronic medium would:
36 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
37 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
38 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
39 otherwise confidential.
40 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
41 custody or control of a public record:
42 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
43 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
44 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
45 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
46 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
47 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.] (Deleted by amendment.)

37 agency of the State of Nevada.
38 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and employees
39 pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees of the school district must
40 not be excluded from participating in the group insurance. If the amount of the
41 deductions from compensation required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the
42 compensation to which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the
43 trustee.
44 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists, the governing
45 body of the county, or of any school district, municipal corporation, political
46 subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental agency of the State of
