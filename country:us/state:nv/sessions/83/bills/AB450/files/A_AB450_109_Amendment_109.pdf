EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; revising requirements to obtain a license as a
marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor by

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of marriage and family therapists
2 and clinical professional counselors by the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family
3 Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Existing law sets
4 forth procedures by which a marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor
5 who is licensed in the District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States may
6 obtain a license by endorsement to practice in this State. Under existing law, the Board is
7 authorized to [obtain] issue such a license by endorsement [,] to an applicant [must submit]
8 who submits to the Board, among other things [,] : (1) proof satisfactory to the Board that the
9 applicant has not been disciplined or investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority of
10 the District of Columbia or the state or territory in which the applicant holds a license as a
11 marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor, as applicable [.] ; and (2) any
12 other information required by the Board. (NRS 641A.242) This bill instead requires,
13 rather than authorizes, the Board to issue such a license by endorsement to an applicant
14 who meets the applicable requirements and eliminates the [requirement] requirements that
15 an applicant submit : (1) proof to the Board that the applicant has not been investigated by the
16 corresponding regulatory authority, thereby making a person who has been investigated by the
17 corresponding regulatory authority, but who has not been disciplined by the authority, eligible
18 to obtain a license by endorsement [.] ; and (2) any other information required by the
19 Board.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

25 3. Not later than 15 business days after receiving an application for a license
26 by endorsement to practice as a marriage and family therapist or clinical
27 professional counselor pursuant to this section, the Board shall provide written
28 notice to the applicant of any additional information required by the Board to
29 consider the application. Unless the Board denies the application for good cause,

39 by endorsement pursuant to this section, the Board may, for any reason, grant a
40 provisional license authorizing an applicant to practice as a marriage and family
41 therapist or clinical professional counselor, as applicable, in accordance with
