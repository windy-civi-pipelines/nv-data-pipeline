EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; revising requirements to obtain a
license as a marriage and family therapist or clinical
professional counselor by endorsement; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of marriage and family
2 therapists and clinical professional counselors by the Board of Examiners for
3 Marriage and Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors. (Chapter
4 641A of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which a marriage and family
5 therapist or clinical professional counselor who is licensed in the District of
6 Columbia or any state or territory of the United States may obtain a license by
7 endorsement to practice in this State. Under existing law, the Board is authorized to
8 issue such a license by endorsement to an applicant who submits to the Board,
9 among other things: (1) proof satisfactory to the Board that the applicant has not
10 been disciplined or investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority of the
11 District of Columbia or the state or territory in which the applicant holds a license
12 as a marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor, as applicable;
13 and (2) any other information required by the Board. (NRS 641A.242) This bill
14 instead requires, rather than authorizes, the Board to issue such a license by
15 endorsement to an applicant who meets the applicable requirements and eliminates
16 the requirements that an applicant submit: (1) proof to the Board that the applicant
17 has not been investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority, thereby
18 making a person who has been investigated by the corresponding regulatory
19 authority, but who has not been disciplined by the authority, eligible to obtain a
20 license by endorsement; and (2) any other information required by the Board.
