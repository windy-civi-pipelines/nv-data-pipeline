EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; revising requirements to obtain a license as a
marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor by
endorsement; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of marriage and family therapists
2 and clinical professional counselors by the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family
3 Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Existing law sets
4 forth procedures by which a marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor
5 who is licensed in the District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States may
6 obtain a license by endorsement to practice in this State. Under existing law, the Board is
7 authorized to issue such a license by endorsement to an applicant who submits to the Board,
8 among other things , [: (1)] proof satisfactory to the Board that the applicant has not been
9 disciplined or investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority of the District of
10 Columbia or the state or territory in which the applicant holds a license as a marriage and
11 family therapist or clinical professional counselor, as applicable . [; and (2) any other
12 information required by the Board.] (NRS 641A.242) This bill instead requires, rather than
13 authorizes, the Board to issue such a license by endorsement to an applicant who meets the
14 applicable requirements . [and] This bill additionally eliminates the [requirements]
15 requirement that an applicant submit [: (1)] proof to the Board that the applicant has not been
16 investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority, thereby making a person who has been
17 investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority, but who has not been disciplined by
18 the authority, eligible to obtain a license by endorsement . [; and (2) any other information
19 required by the Board.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

25 (e) Any other information required by the Board.
26 3. Not later than 15 business days after receiving an application for a license
27 by endorsement to practice as a marriage and family therapist or clinical
28 professional counselor pursuant to this section, the Board shall provide written
29 notice to the applicant of any additional information required by the Board to
