Assembly Bill No. 450–Assemblymember Marzola
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to professions; revising requirements to obtain a
license as a marriage and family therapist or clinical
professional counselor by endorsement; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of marriage and family
therapists and clinical professional counselors by the Board of Examiners for
Marriage and Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors. (Chapter
641A of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which a marriage and family
therapist or clinical professional counselor who is licensed in the District of
Columbia or any state or territory of the United States may obtain a license by
endorsement to practice in this State. Under existing law, the Board is authorized to
issue such a license by endorsement to an applicant who submits to the Board,
among other things, proof satisfactory to the Board that the applicant has not been
disciplined or investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority of the District
of Columbia or the state or territory in which the applicant holds a license as a
marriage and family therapist or clinical professional counselor, as applicable.
(NRS 641A.242) This bill instead requires, rather than authorizes, the Board to
issue such a license by endorsement to an applicant who meets the applicable
requirements. This bill additionally eliminates the requirement that an applicant
submit proof to the Board that the applicant has not been investigated by the
corresponding regulatory authority, thereby making a person who has been
investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority, but who has not been
disciplined by the authority, eligible to obtain a license by endorsement.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

additional information required by the Board to consider the
application. Unless the Board denies the application for good cause,
the Board shall approve the application and issue a license by
endorsement to practice as a marriage and family therapist or
clinical professional counselor, as applicable, to the applicant not
later than 45 days after receiving all the additional information
required by the Board to complete the application.
4. A license by endorsement to practice as a marriage and
family therapist or clinical professional counselor may be issued at a
meeting of the Board or between its meetings by the President of the
Board. Such an action shall be deemed to be an action of the Board.
5. At any time before making a final decision on an application
for a license by endorsement pursuant to this section, the Board
may, for any reason, grant a provisional license authorizing an
applicant to practice as a marriage and family therapist or clinical
professional counselor, as applicable, in accordance with regulations
adopted by the Board.
