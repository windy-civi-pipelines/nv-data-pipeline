EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; revising requirements to obtain a
license as a marriage and family therapist or clinical
professional counselor by endorsement; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of marriage and family
2 therapists and clinical professional counselors by the Board of Examiners for
3 Marriage and Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors. (Chapter
4 641A of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which a marriage and family
5 therapist or clinical professional counselor who is licensed in the District of
6 Columbia or any state or territory of the United States may obtain a license by
7 endorsement to practice in this State. Under existing law, to obtain such a license
8 by endorsement, an applicant must submit to the Board, among other things, proof
9 satisfactory to the Board that the applicant has not been disciplined or investigated
10 by the corresponding regulatory authority of the District of Columbia or the state or
11 territory in which the applicant holds a license as a marriage and family therapist or
12 clinical professional counselor, as applicable. (NRS 641A.242) This bill eliminates
13 the requirement that an applicant submit proof to the Board that the applicant has
14 not been investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority, thereby making a
15 person who has been investigated by the corresponding regulatory authority, but
16 who has not been disciplined by the authority, eligible to obtain a license by
17 endorsement.
