EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to local improvement projects; authorizing any
county, city or town to repair a private water or sewer
system that is owned by a common-interest community as
part of a neighborhood improvement project; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the governing body of any county, city or town to
2 create an improvement district for the acquisition, improvement, equipment,
3 operation and maintenance of certain local improvement projects, including a
4 neighborhood improvement project, and to finance the cost of any such project
5 through such methods as the issuance of certain bonds and the levy of assessments
6 upon property in the improvement district. (NRS 271.265, 271.270, 271.325)
7 Section 1 of this bill amends the definition of “neighborhood improvement project”
8 to include the improvement of a water or sewer system that is owned by a common-
9 interest community.
10 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of
11 any county, city or town to dissolve by resolution an improvement district that is
12 created for the purposes of a neighborhood improvement project. (NRS 271.296)
13 Section 2 of this bill provides that the authority to dissolve an improvement district
14 does not apply to a neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or
15 sewer system that is owned by a common-interest community.
16 Existing law sets forth certain notice requirements for a hearing as to the
17 propriety and advisability of an improvement project that has been provisionally
18 ordered by the governing body of a county, city or town. For a neighborhood
19 improvement project, the notice must state that: (1) a person who owns or resides
20 within a tract in the proposed improvement district may file a protest to inclusion in

– 2 –
21 the assessment plat; and (2) if written remonstrances by the owners of tracts
22 constituting one-third or more of the basis for the computation of assessments for
23 the neighborhood improvement project are presented to the governing body, the
24 governing body is prohibited from proceeding with the project. (NRS 271.305,
25 271.306) Section 3 of this bill provides that this prohibition does not apply to a
26 neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or sewer system that is
27 owned by a common-interest community. Instead, section 4 of this bill provides
28 that a neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or sewer system
29 that is owned by a common-interest community will not be stayed or defeated or
30 prevented by written complaints, protests and objections, unless the governing body
31 deems such written complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the
32 neighborhood improvement project to be stayed or prevented.
33 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the governing
34 body of a county, city or town to proceed with the improvement district after the
35 hearing and after the governing body makes certain determinations, including a
36 determination that an exception applies that authorizes the governing body to
37 acquire or improve an improvement project despite certain complaints, protests and
38 objections.
39 Existing law requires a governing body which has acquired or improved a
40 neighborhood improvement project to annually: (1) prepare an amendment to the
41 assessment roll for the district and an estimate of the expenditures for the next
42 fiscal year; (2) hold a public meeting to consider the amendment; and (3) provide
43 certain notice to the owner of each tract being assessed. (NRS 271.377) Section 6
44 of this bill makes these provisions inapplicable to a neighborhood improvement
45 project that improves a water or sewer system that is owned by a common-interest
46 community.

3 unit.
4 10. The engineer may make minor changes in time, plans and

11 Sec. 4. NRS 271.306 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 271.306 1. Regardless of the basis used for apportioning
13 assessments, the amount apportioned to a wedge or V or any other
14 irregularly shaped tract must be in proportion to the special benefits
15 thereby derived.
16 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 , [and] 4 [,]
17 and 5, if, within the time specified in the notice, complaints,
18 protests and objections in writing, that is, all written remonstrances,
19 against acquiring or improving the project proposed by initiation of
20 the governing body are filed with the clerk, signed by the owners of
21 tracts constituting a majority of the frontage, of the area, of the zone,
22 or of the other basis for the computation of assessments, as the case
23 may be, of the tracts to be assessed in the improvement district or in
24 the assessment unit if the improvement district is divided into
25 assessment units, the project therein must not be acquired or
26 improved unless:
27 (a) The municipality pays one-half or more of the total cost of
28 the project, other than a park project, with money derived from other
29 than the levy of assessments; or
30 (b) The project constitutes not more than 2,640 feet, including
31 intersections, remaining unimproved in any street, including an
32 alley, between improvements already made to either side of the
33 same street or between improvements already made to intersecting
34 streets. In this case the governing body may on its own motion cause
35 the intervening and unimproved part of the street to be improved.
36 Such improvements will not be stayed or defeated or prevented by
37 written complaints, protests and objections thereto, unless the
38 governing body in its sole discretion, deems such written
39 complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the improvement
40 to be stayed or prevented.
41 3. Written remonstrances by the owners of tracts constituting
42 50 percent of the basis for the computation of assessments suffice to
43 preclude the acquisition or improvement of a street beautification
44 project or waterfront maintenance project.

*AB10*

– 7 –
1 4. Written remonstrances by the owners of tracts constituting at
2 least one-third of the basis for the computation of assessments
3 suffice to preclude the acquisition or improvement of a
4 neighborhood improvement project [.] described in subsection 1 or
5 2 of NRS 271.147. For the purposes of this subsection, the property
6 of a single owner may not be counted as constituting more than 10
7 percent of the basis.
8 5. A neighborhood improvement project described in
9 subsection 3 of NRS 271.147 will not be stayed or defeated or
10 prevented by written complaints, protests and objections thereto,
11 unless the governing body in its sole discretion, deems such
12 written complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the
13 neighborhood improvement project to be stayed or prevented.
14 Sec. 5. NRS 271.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 271.320 1. After the hearing and after the governing body
16 has:
17 (a) Disposed of all complaints, protests and objections, oral and
18 in writing;
19 (b) Determined that it is not prevented from proceeding pursuant
20 to subsection 3 or 4 of NRS 271.306; and
21 (c) Determined that:
22 (1) [Either or both] Any of the exceptions stated in
23 [subsection 2 of] NRS 271.306 apply; or
24 (2) There were not filed with the clerk complaints, protests
25 and objections in writing and signed by the owners of tracts
26 constituting a majority of the frontage, of the area, of the zone, or of
27 the other basis for the computation of assessments stated in the
28 notice, of the tracts to be assessed in the improvement district or in
29 the assessment unit, if any,
30  and the governing body has jurisdiction to proceed, the governing
31 body shall determine whether to proceed with the improvement
32 district, and with each assessment unit, if any, except as otherwise
33 provided in this chapter.
34 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 271.640 to 271.646,
35 inclusive, if the governing body desires to proceed and desires any
36 modification, by motion or resolution it shall direct the engineer to
37 prepare and present to the governing body:
38 (a) A revised and detailed estimate of the total cost, including,
39 without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of
40 acquiring or improving each proposed project and of each of the
41 incidental costs. The revised estimate does not constitute a
42 limitation for any purpose.
43 (b) Full and detailed plans and specifications for each proposed
44 project designed to permit and encourage competition among the
45 bidders, if any project is to be acquired by construction contract.
-
*AB10*

– 8 –
1 (c) A revised map and assessment plat showing respectively the
2 location of each project and the tracts to be assessed therefor, not
3 including any area or project not before the governing body at a
4 provisional order hearing.
5 3. That resolution, a separate resolution, or the ordinance
6 creating the improvement district may combine or divide the
7 proposed project or projects into suitable construction units for the
8 purpose of letting separate and independent contracts, regardless of
9 the extent of any project constituting an assessment unit and
10 regardless of whether a portion or none of the cost of any project is
11 to be defrayed other than by the levy of special assessments. Costs
12 of unrelated projects must be segregated for assessment purposes as
13 provided in this chapter.
14 Sec. 6. NRS 271.377 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 271.377 1. [On] For a neighborhood improvement district
16 described in subsection 1 or 2 of NRS 271.147, on or before
17 June 30 of each year after the governing body acquires or improves
18 [a] the neighborhood improvement project, the governing body shall
19 prepare or cause to be prepared an estimate of the expenditures
20 required in the ensuing fiscal year and a proposed amendment to the
21 assessment roll assessing an amount not greater than the estimated
22 cost against the benefited property. The amendment to the
23 assessment must be computed according to frontage or another
24 uniform and quantifiable basis.
25 2. The governing body shall consider the amendment to the
26 assessment roll at a public meeting of the governing body. Notice
27 must be given by mail or, upon written request and to the extent
28 practicable, by electronic mail to the owner of each tract to be
29 assessed at least 21 days before the date of the meeting of the
30 governing body. The notice must set forth the amount of the
31 assessment roll for the ensuing fiscal year.
32 3. The agenda for a public meeting of the governing body to
33 consider an amendment to the assessment roll must list the
34 amendment as a separate action item. The governing body shall not
35 approve an amendment to the assessment roll as a group of agenda
36 items in a single motion.
37 4. After the meeting, the governing body shall confirm the
38 assessments, as specified in the amendment to the assessment roll,
39 by resolution and mail notice of the assessments to the owner of
40 each tract being assessed. The notice must set forth the date on
41 which the assessment is due and instructions for paying the
42 assessment.
43 5. An improvement district created for a neighborhood
44 improvement project is not entitled to any distribution from the local
45 government tax distribution account.
