Section 1:
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to local improvement projects; authorizing any
county, city or town to repair a private water or sewer system
that is owned by a common-interest community as part of a
neighborhood improvement project; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the governing body of any county, city or town to
create an improvement district for the acquisition, improvement, equipment,
operation and maintenance of certain local improvement projects, including a
neighborhood improvement project, and to finance the cost of any such project
through such methods as the issuance of certain bonds and the levy of assessments
upon property in the improvement district. (NRS 271.265, 271.270, 271.325)

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill amends the definition of “neighborhood improvement project”
to include the improvement of a water or sewer system that is owned by a common-
interest community.
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of
any county, city or town to dissolve by resolution an improvement district that is
created for the purposes of a neighborhood improvement project. (NRS 271.296)

Section 3:
Section 2 of this bill provides that the authority to dissolve an improvement district
does not apply to a neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or
sewer system that is owned by a common-interest community.
Existing law sets forth certain notice requirements for a hearing as to the
propriety and advisability of an improvement project that has been provisionally
ordered by the governing body of a county, city or town. For a neighborhood
improvement project, the notice must state that: (1) a person who owns or resides
within a tract in the proposed improvement district may file a protest to inclusion in
the assessment plat; and (2) if written remonstrances by the owners of tracts
constituting one-third or more of the basis for the computation of assessments for
the neighborhood improvement project are presented to the governing body, the
governing body is prohibited from proceeding with the project. (NRS 271.305,

Section 4:
271.306) Section 3 of this bill provides that this prohibition does not apply to a
neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or sewer system that is
owned by a common-interest community. Instead, section 4 of this bill provides
that a neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or sewer system
that is owned by a common-interest community will not be stayed or defeated or
prevented by written complaints, protests and objections, unless the governing body
deems such written complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the
neighborhood improvement project to be stayed or prevented.

Section 5:
Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the governing
body of a county, city or town to proceed with the improvement district after the
hearing and after the governing body makes certain determinations, including a
determination that an exception applies that authorizes the governing body to
acquire or improve an improvement project despite certain complaints, protests and
objections.
Existing law requires a governing body which has acquired or improved a
neighborhood improvement project to annually: (1) prepare an amendment to the
assessment roll for the district and an estimate of the expenditures for the next
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
fiscal year; (2) hold a public meeting to consider the amendment; and (3) provide
certain notice to the owner of each tract being assessed. (NRS 271.377) Section 6
of this bill makes these provisions inapplicable to a neighborhood improvement
project that improves a water or sewer system that is owned by a common-interest
community.

or of the other basis for the computation of assessments, as the case
may be, of the tracts to be assessed in the improvement district or in

complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the improvement
to be stayed or prevented.

 and the governing body has jurisdiction to proceed, the governing
body shall determine whether to proceed with the improvement
district, and with each assessment unit, if any, except as otherwise

prepare and present to the governing body:
(a) A revised and detailed estimate of the total cost, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of
acquiring or improving each proposed project and of each of the
incidental costs. The revised estimate does not constitute a
limitation for any purpose.

project designed to permit and encourage competition among the
bidders, if any project is to be acquired by construction contract.
(c) A revised map and assessment plat showing respectively the
location of each project and the tracts to be assessed therefor, not
including any area or project not before the governing body at a
provisional order hearing.

3. That resolution, a separate resolution, or the ordinance
creating the improvement district may combine or divide the
proposed project or projects into suitable construction units for the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 8 –
purpose of letting separate and independent contracts, regardless of
the extent of any project constituting an assessment unit and
regardless of whether a portion or none of the cost of any project is
to be defrayed other than by the levy of special assessments. Costs
of unrelated projects must be segregated for assessment purposes as
provided in this chapter.
Sec. 6. NRS 271.377 is hereby amended to read as follows:

[a] the neighborhood improvement project, the governing body shall
prepare or cause to be prepared an estimate of the expenditures
required in the ensuing fiscal year and a proposed amendment to the
assessment roll assessing an amount not greater than the estimated
cost against the benefited property. The amendment to the
assessment must be computed according to frontage or another
uniform and quantifiable basis.

Section 38:

Assembly Bill No. 10–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to local improvement projects; authorizing any
county, city or town to repair a private water or sewer system
that is owned by a common-interest community as part of a
neighborhood improvement project; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the governing body of any county, city or town to
create an improvement district for the acquisition, improvement, equipment,
operation and maintenance of certain local improvement projects, including a
neighborhood improvement project, and to finance the cost of any such project
through such methods as the issuance of certain bonds and the levy of assessments
upon property in the improvement district. (NRS 271.265, 271.270, 271.325)
Section 1 of this bill amends the definition of “neighborhood improvement project”
to include the improvement of a water or sewer system that is owned by a common-
interest community.
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of
any county, city or town to dissolve by resolution an improvement district that is

Section 2 of this bill provides that the authority to dissolve an improvement district
does not apply to a neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or
sewer system that is owned by a common-interest community.
Existing law sets forth certain notice requirements for a hearing as to the
propriety and advisability of an improvement project that has been provisionally
ordered by the governing body of a county, city or town. For a neighborhood
improvement project, the notice must state that: (1) a person who owns or resides
within a tract in the proposed improvement district may file a protest to inclusion in
the assessment plat; and (2) if written remonstrances by the owners of tracts
constituting one-third or more of the basis for the computation of assessments for
the neighborhood improvement project are presented to the governing body, the
governing body is prohibited from proceeding with the project. (NRS 271.305,
271.306) Section 3 of this bill provides that this prohibition does not apply to a
neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or sewer system that is
owned by a common-interest community. Instead, section 4 of this bill provides
that a neighborhood improvement project that improves a water or sewer system
that is owned by a common-interest community will not be stayed or defeated or
prevented by written complaints, protests and objections, unless the governing body
deems such written complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the
neighborhood improvement project to be stayed or prevented.
Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the governing
body of a county, city or town to proceed with the improvement district after the
hearing and after the governing body makes certain determinations, including a
determination that an exception applies that authorizes the governing body to
acquire or improve an improvement project despite certain complaints, protests and

of this bill makes these provisions inapplicable to a neighborhood improvement
project that improves a water or sewer system that is owned by a common-interest

Sec. 4. NRS 271.306 is hereby amended to read as follows:
271.306 1. Regardless of the basis used for apportioning
assessments, the amount apportioned to a wedge or V or any other
irregularly shaped tract must be in proportion to the special benefits
thereby derived.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 , [and] 4 [,]
and 5, if, within the time specified in the notice, complaints,
protests and objections in writing, that is, all written remonstrances,
against acquiring or improving the project proposed by initiation of
the governing body are filed with the clerk, signed by the owners of
tracts constituting a majority of the frontage, of the area, of the zone,
or of the other basis for the computation of assessments, as the case
may be, of the tracts to be assessed in the improvement district or in
the assessment unit if the improvement district is divided into
assessment units, the project therein must not be acquired or
improved unless:
(a) The municipality pays one-half or more of the total cost of
the project, other than a park project, with money derived from other
than the levy of assessments; or
(b) The project constitutes not more than 2,640 feet, including
intersections, remaining unimproved in any street, including an
alley, between improvements already made to either side of the
same street or between improvements already made to intersecting
streets. In this case the governing body may on its own motion cause
the intervening and unimproved part of the street to be improved.
Such improvements will not be stayed or defeated or prevented by
written complaints, protests and objections thereto, unless the
governing body in its sole discretion, deems such written
complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the improvement
to be stayed or prevented.
3. Written remonstrances by the owners of tracts constituting
50 percent of the basis for the computation of assessments suffice to
preclude the acquisition or improvement of a street beautification
project or waterfront maintenance project.
4. Written remonstrances by the owners of tracts constituting at
least one-third of the basis for the computation of assessments
suffice to preclude the acquisition or improvement of a
neighborhood improvement project [.] described in subsection 1 or
2 of NRS 271.147. For the purposes of this subsection, the property
of a single owner may not be counted as constituting more than 10
percent of the basis.
5. A neighborhood improvement project described in
subsection 3 of NRS 271.147 will not be stayed or defeated or
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –

unless the governing body in its sole discretion, deems such
written complaints, protests and objections proper to cause the
neighborhood improvement project to be stayed or prevented.
Sec. 5. NRS 271.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
271.320 1. After the hearing and after the governing body
has:
(a) Disposed of all complaints, protests and objections, oral and
in writing;
(b) Determined that it is not prevented from proceeding pursuant
to subsection 3 or 4 of NRS 271.306; and
(c) Determined that:
(1) [Either or both] Any of the exceptions stated in
[subsection 2 of] NRS 271.306 apply; or
(2) There were not filed with the clerk complaints, protests
and objections in writing and signed by the owners of tracts
constituting a majority of the frontage, of the area, of the zone, or of
the other basis for the computation of assessments stated in the
notice, of the tracts to be assessed in the improvement district or in
the assessment unit, if any,
 and the governing body has jurisdiction to proceed, the governing
body shall determine whether to proceed with the improvement
district, and with each assessment unit, if any, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.
2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 271.640 to 271.646,
inclusive, if the governing body desires to proceed and desires any
modification, by motion or resolution it shall direct the engineer to
prepare and present to the governing body:
(a) A revised and detailed estimate of the total cost, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of
acquiring or improving each proposed project and of each of the
incidental costs. The revised estimate does not constitute a
limitation for any purpose.
(b) Full and detailed plans and specifications for each proposed
project designed to permit and encourage competition among the
bidders, if any project is to be acquired by construction contract.
(c) A revised map and assessment plat showing respectively the
location of each project and the tracts to be assessed therefor, not
including any area or project not before the governing body at a
provisional order hearing.
3. That resolution, a separate resolution, or the ordinance
creating the improvement district may combine or divide the
proposed project or projects into suitable construction units for the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 8 –
purpose of letting separate and independent contracts, regardless of
the extent of any project constituting an assessment unit and
regardless of whether a portion or none of the cost of any project is
to be defrayed other than by the levy of special assessments. Costs
of unrelated projects must be segregated for assessment purposes as
provided in this chapter.
Sec. 6. NRS 271.377 is hereby amended to read as follows:
271.377 1. [On] For a neighborhood improvement district
described in subsection 1 or 2 of NRS 271.147, on or before
June 30 of each year after the governing body acquires or improves
[a] the neighborhood improvement project, the governing body shall
prepare or cause to be prepared an estimate of the expenditures
required in the ensuing fiscal year and a proposed amendment to the
assessment roll assessing an amount not greater than the estimated
cost against the benefited property. The amendment to the
assessment must be computed according to frontage or another
uniform and quantifiable basis.
2. The governing body shall consider the amendment to the
assessment roll at a public meeting of the governing body. Notice
must be given by mail or, upon written request and to the extent
practicable, by electronic mail to the owner of each tract to be
assessed at least 21 days before the date of the meeting of the
governing body. The notice must set forth the amount of the
assessment roll for the ensuing fiscal year.
3. The agenda for a public meeting of the governing body to
consider an amendment to the assessment roll must list the
amendment as a separate action item. The governing body shall not
approve an amendment to the assessment roll as a group of agenda
items in a single motion.
4. After the meeting, the governing body shall confirm the
assessments, as specified in the amendment to the assessment roll,
by resolution and mail notice of the assessments to the owner of
each tract being assessed. The notice must set forth the date on
which the assessment is due and instructions for paying the
assessment.
5. An improvement district created for a neighborhood
improvement project is not entitled to any distribution from the local
government tax distribution account.
Sec. 7. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
