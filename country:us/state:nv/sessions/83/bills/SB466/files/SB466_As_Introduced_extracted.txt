Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments,
2 cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some
4 instances, the local boards of health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-
5 44 of this bill transfer the authority for the permitting and regulation of food
6 establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events from the Division
-
*SB466*
– 2 –
7 to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health. Section 9
8 defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
9 Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of
10 this bill repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments.
11 Section 74 of this bill provides that any permit issued by the Division or health
12 authority pursuant to the repealed provisions of law shall remain effective until the
13 expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this bill provides that any regulation adopted
14 by a local board of health which was previously required to be approved by the
15 State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the Department. Sections 45-
16 50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to internal references to
17 reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
18 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
19 regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS
20 439.200) Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt
21 regulations consistent with law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
22 food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410) Section 14 of this bill transfers the
23 authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
24 food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department. Sections 61 and
25 62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health relating
26 to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
27 regulations adopted by the Department.
28 Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an
29 amount determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county
30 by the Division, including services relating to food establishments. Existing law
31 authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive an exemption
32 from this assessment from the Interim Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905)
33 Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an assessment for the costs of
34 any services provided in the county by the Department relating to food
35 establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and
36 receive an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 51 of this bill
37 authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or
38 special session. Section 76 of this bill provides that any county which has already
39 received such an exemption shall be deemed to have received an exemption from
40 the assessment required by section 15.
41 Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food
42 establishment and who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared
43 or served for immediate consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or
44 product made using hemp to manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food
45 that contains an approved hemp component at the food establishment. (NRS
46 446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may only purchase or use hemp or a
47 commodity or product made using hemp that the United States Food and Drug
48 Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for use as
49 an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.

IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR)
MAY 15, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the authority of the
State Department of Agriculture relating to food and
water. (BDR 51-1121)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; transferring the authority to
regulate and permit food establishments from the Division
of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of
Health and Human Services to the State Department of
Agriculture; transferring the authority of the State Board
of Health to adopt, amend and enforce regulations to
provide for the sanitary protection of water and food
supplies to the State Department of Agriculture; repealing
various provisions governing food establishments;
requiring, with certain exceptions, a county to pay an
assessment to the Department for services relating to food
establishments; revising provisions relating to the
purchase or use of hemp or commodities or products
made using hemp by certain persons who operate a food
establishment; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments,
2 cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some
4 instances, the local boards of health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-
5 44 of this bill transfer the authority for the permitting and regulation of food
6 establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events from the Division
-
*SB466*

– 2 –
7 to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health. Section 9
8 defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
9 Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of
10 this bill repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments.
11 Section 74 of this bill provides that any permit issued by the Division or health
12 authority pursuant to the repealed provisions of law shall remain effective until the
13 expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this bill provides that any regulation adopted
14 by a local board of health which was previously required to be approved by the
15 State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the Department. Sections 45-
16 50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to internal references to
17 reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
18 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
19 regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS
20 439.200) Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt
21 regulations consistent with law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
22 food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410) Section 14 of this bill transfers the
23 authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
24 food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department. Sections 61 and
25 62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health relating
26 to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
27 regulations adopted by the Department.
28 Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an
29 amount determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county
30 by the Division, including services relating to food establishments. Existing law
31 authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive an exemption
32 from this assessment from the Interim Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905)
33 Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an assessment for the costs of
34 any services provided in the county by the Department relating to food
35 establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and
36 receive an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 51 of this bill
37 authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or
38 special session. Section 76 of this bill provides that any county which has already
39 received such an exemption shall be deemed to have received an exemption from
40 the assessment required by section 15.
41 Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food
42 establishment and who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared
43 or served for immediate consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or
44 product made using hemp to manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food
45 that contains an approved hemp component at the food establishment. (NRS
46 446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may only purchase or use hemp or a
47 commodity or product made using hemp that the United States Food and Drug
48 Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for use as
49 an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.
