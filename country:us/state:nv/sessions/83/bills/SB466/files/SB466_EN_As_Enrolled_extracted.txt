Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments,
cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and
Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some
instances, the local boards of health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-
44 of this bill transfer the authority for the permitting and regulation of food
establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events from the Division
to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health. Section 9
defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of
this bill repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments.

Section 2:
Section 74 of this bill provides that any permit issued by the Division or health
authority pursuant to the repealed provisions of law shall remain effective until the
expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this bill provides that any regulation adopted
by a local board of health which was previously required to be approved by the
State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the Department. Sections 45-
50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to internal references to
reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS

Section 3:
439.200) Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt
regulations consistent with law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410) Section 14 of this bill transfers the
authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department. Sections 61 and
62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health relating
to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
regulations adopted by the Department.

Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an
amount determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county
by the Division, including services relating to food establishments. Existing law
authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive an exemption
from this assessment from the Interim Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905)

Section 4:
Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an assessment for the costs of
any services provided in the county by the Department relating to food
establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and
receive an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 15 also
authorizes the Department to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out the
provisions of the section which, if adopted, must ensure the financial solvency of
the Department in providing such services. Section 51 of this bill authorizes the
Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or special session.

Section 5:
Section 75.5 of this bill requires the State Department of Agriculture to review the
budget of the Department, any fee charged to a food establishment by the Division
and the assessments paid to the Division for the costs of services provided to a
county by the Division relating to food establishments to determine the amount of
the assessments that are necessary to ensure the financial solvency of the
Department in providing such services and, based on the results of the review, the
Department may increase the assessments required by section 15. Section 76 of
this bill provides that any county which has already received such an exemption
shall be deemed to have received an exemption from the assessment required by

Section 6:
section 15.
Existing law exempts a cottage food operation from certain requirements
governing food establishments. Existing law limits the definition of “cottage food
operation” to a natural person whose gross sales of certain food items are not more
than $35,000 per year. (NRS 446.866) Section 22 of this bill increases this limit on
gross sales to $100,000 and requires the State Department of Agriculture to adjust
this amount on an annual basis based on the percentage increase in the Consumer
Price Index (All Items).
Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
conditions, including that any poultry and meat from a rabbit that is served at such
an event is raised and prepared on the farm and is butchered and processed on the
farm in accordance with certain requirements relating to the inspection of meat and
poultry. (NRS 446.868) Section 23 of this bill provides that a farm may also serve
at a farm-to-fork event: (1) meat from livestock under the same circumstances; and
(2) poultry, meat from livestock and meat from a rabbit if the poultry or meat is
obtained from a facility that meets certain requirements of state law relating to the
inspection of meat and poultry or from a facility under a federal inspection
program.
Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food
establishment and who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared
or served for immediate consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or
product made using hemp to manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food
that contains an approved hemp component at the food establishment. (NRS

Section 7:
446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may only purchase or use hemp or a
commodity or product made using hemp that the United States Food and Drug
Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for use as
an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.

Senate Bill No. 466–Committee on Finance
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; transferring the authority to
regulate and permit food establishments from the Division of
Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health
and Human Services to the State Department of Agriculture;
transferring the authority of the State Board of Health to
adopt, amend and enforce regulations to provide for the
sanitary protection of water and food supplies to the State
Department of Agriculture; repealing various provisions
governing food establishments; requiring, with certain
exceptions, a county to pay an assessment to the Department
for services relating to food establishments; revising
provisions relating to cottage food operations; revising
provisions relating to farm-to-fork events; revising provisions
relating to the purchase or use of hemp or commodities or
products made using hemp by certain persons who operate a
food establishment; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments,
cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and
Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some
instances, the local boards of health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-
44 of this bill transfer the authority for the permitting and regulation of food
establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events from the Division
to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health. Section 9
defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of
this bill repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments.
Section 74 of this bill provides that any permit issued by the Division or health
authority pursuant to the repealed provisions of law shall remain effective until the
expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this bill provides that any regulation adopted
by a local board of health which was previously required to be approved by the
State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the Department. Sections 45-
50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to internal references to
reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS
439.200) Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt
regulations consistent with law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410) Section 14 of this bill transfers the
authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department. Sections 61 and
62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health relating
to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
regulations adopted by the Department.

Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an
amount determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county
by the Division, including services relating to food establishments. Existing law
authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive an exemption
from this assessment from the Interim Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905)
Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an assessment for the costs of
any services provided in the county by the Department relating to food
establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and
receive an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 15 also
authorizes the Department to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out the
provisions of the section which, if adopted, must ensure the financial solvency of
the Department in providing such services. Section 51 of this bill authorizes the
Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or special session.
Section 75.5 of this bill requires the State Department of Agriculture to review the
budget of the Department, any fee charged to a food establishment by the Division
and the assessments paid to the Division for the costs of services provided to a
county by the Division relating to food establishments to determine the amount of
the assessments that are necessary to ensure the financial solvency of the
Department in providing such services and, based on the results of the review, the
Department may increase the assessments required by section 15. Section 76 of
this bill provides that any county which has already received such an exemption
shall be deemed to have received an exemption from the assessment required by
section 15.
Existing law exempts a cottage food operation from certain requirements
governing food establishments. Existing law limits the definition of “cottage food
operation” to a natural person whose gross sales of certain food items are not more
than $35,000 per year. (NRS 446.866) Section 22 of this bill increases this limit on
gross sales to $100,000 and requires the State Department of Agriculture to adjust
this amount on an annual basis based on the percentage increase in the Consumer
Price Index (All Items).
Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
conditions, including that any poultry and meat from a rabbit that is served at such
an event is raised and prepared on the farm and is butchered and processed on the
farm in accordance with certain requirements relating to the inspection of meat and
poultry. (NRS 446.868) Section 23 of this bill provides that a farm may also serve
at a farm-to-fork event: (1) meat from livestock under the same circumstances; and
(2) poultry, meat from livestock and meat from a rabbit if the poultry or meat is
obtained from a facility that meets certain requirements of state law relating to the
inspection of meat and poultry or from a facility under a federal inspection
program.
Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food
establishment and who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared
or served for immediate consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or
product made using hemp to manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food
that contains an approved hemp component at the food establishment. (NRS
446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may only purchase or use hemp or a
commodity or product made using hemp that the United States Food and Drug
Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for use as
an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.
