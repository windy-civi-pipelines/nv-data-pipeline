AN ACT relating to public safety; transferring the authority to regulate and permit
food establishments from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health
of the Department of Health and Human Services to the State
Department of Agriculture; transferring the authority of the State
Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce regulations to provide for

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments, cottage
2 food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
3 the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some instances, the local boards of
4 health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-44 of this bill transfer the authority for
5 the permitting and regulation of food establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork
6 events from the Division to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health.
7 Section 9 defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
8 Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of this bill
9 repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments. Section 74 of this bill
10 provides that any permit issued by the Division or health authority pursuant to the repealed
11 provisions of law shall remain effective until the expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this
12 bill provides that any regulation adopted by a local board of health which was previously
Senate Amendment No. 892 to Senate Bill No. 466 Page 4
13 required to be approved by the State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the
14 Department. Sections 45-50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to
15 internal references to reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
16 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
17 regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS 439.200)
18 Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt regulations consistent with
19 law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410)
20 Section 14 of this bill transfers the authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary
21 protection of water and food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department.
22 Sections 61 and 62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health
23 relating to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
24 regulations adopted by the Department.
25 Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an amount
26 determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county by the Division,
27 including services relating to food establishments. Existing law authorizes a county to request
28 to carry out these services and receive an exemption from this assessment from the Interim
29 Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905) Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an
30 assessment for the costs of any services provided in the county by the Department relating to
31 food establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive
32 an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 51 of this bill authorizes the
33 Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or special session. Section
34 75.5 of this bill requires the State Department of Agriculture to review the assessments
35 paid to the Division for the costs of services provided to a county by the Division relating
36 to food establishments to determine the amount that is necessary to ensure the financial
37 solvency of the Department in providing such services and, based on the results of the
38 review, to increase the assessments required by section 15. Section 76 of this bill provides
39 that any county which has already received such an exemption shall be deemed to have
40 received an exemption from the assessment required by section 15.
41 Existing law exempts a cottage food operation from certain requirements governing
42 food establishments. Existing law limits the definition of “cottage food operation” to a
43 natural person whose gross sales of certain food items are not more than $35,000 per
44 year. (NRS 446.866) Section 22 of this bill increases this limit on gross sales to $100,000
45 and requires the State Department of Agriculture to adjust this amount on an annual
46 basis based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items).
47 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food establishments
48 for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain conditions, including that
49 any poultry and meat from a rabbit that is served at such an event is raised and
50 prepared on the farm and is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance with
51 certain requirements relating to the inspection of meat and poultry. (NRS 446.868)
52 Section 23 of this bill provides that a farm may also serve at a farm-to-fork event: (1)
53 meat from livestock under the same circumstances; and (2) poultry, meat from livestock
54 and meat from a rabbit if the poultry or meat is obtained from a facility that meets
55 certain requirements of state law relating to the inspection of meat and poultry or from
56 a facility under a federal inspection program.
57 Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food establishment and
58 who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared or served for immediate
59 consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp to
60 manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food that contains an approved hemp
61 component at the food establishment. (NRS 446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may
62 only purchase or use hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp that the United States
63 Food and Drug Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for
64 use as an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.

17 ordinance sets forth specific prohibited content for such an advertisement.
18 14. If a cannabis establishment engages in advertising for which it is required
19 to determine the percentage of persons who are less than 21 years of age and who
20 may reasonably be expected to view or hear the advertisement, the cannabis
21 establishment shall maintain documentation for not less than 5 years after the date
22 on which the advertisement is first broadcasted, published or otherwise displayed
23 that demonstrates the manner in which the cannabis establishment determined the
24 reasonably expected age of the audience for that advertisement.
25 15. To the extent that they are inconsistent or otherwise conflict with the
26 regulations adopted by the Board pursuant to NRS 678D.480, the requirements of
27 this section pertaining to cannabis products do not apply to ready-to-consume
28 cannabis products prepared and sold by a cannabis consumption lounge.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; transferring the authority to regulate and permit
food establishments from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health
of the Department of Health and Human Services to the State
Department of Agriculture; transferring the authority of the State
Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce regulations to provide for
the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to the State
Department of Agriculture; repealing various provisions governing
food establishments; requiring, with certain exceptions, a county to pay
an assessment to the Department for services relating to food
establishments; revising provisions relating to cottage food
operations; revising provisions relating to farm-to-fork events;
revising provisions relating to the purchase or use of hemp or
commodities or products made using hemp by certain persons who
operate a food establishment; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments, cottage
2 food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
3 the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some instances, the local boards of
4 health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-44 of this bill transfer the authority for
5 the permitting and regulation of food establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork
6 events from the Division to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health.
7 Section 9 defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
8 Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of this bill
9 repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments. Section 74 of this bill
10 provides that any permit issued by the Division or health authority pursuant to the repealed
11 provisions of law shall remain effective until the expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this
12 bill provides that any regulation adopted by a local board of health which was previously

Senate Amendment No. 892 to Senate Bill No. 466 Page 4
13 required to be approved by the State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the
14 Department. Sections 45-50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to
15 internal references to reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
16 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
17 regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS 439.200)
18 Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt regulations consistent with
19 law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410)
20 Section 14 of this bill transfers the authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary
21 protection of water and food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department.
22 Sections 61 and 62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health
23 relating to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
24 regulations adopted by the Department.
25 Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an amount
26 determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county by the Division,
27 including services relating to food establishments. Existing law authorizes a county to request
28 to carry out these services and receive an exemption from this assessment from the Interim
29 Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905) Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an
30 assessment for the costs of any services provided in the county by the Department relating to
31 food establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive
32 an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 51 of this bill authorizes the
33 Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or special session. Section
34 75.5 of this bill requires the State Department of Agriculture to review the assessments
35 paid to the Division for the costs of services provided to a county by the Division relating
36 to food establishments to determine the amount that is necessary to ensure the financial
37 solvency of the Department in providing such services and, based on the results of the
38 review, to increase the assessments required by section 15. Section 76 of this bill provides
39 that any county which has already received such an exemption shall be deemed to have
40 received an exemption from the assessment required by section 15.
41 Existing law exempts a cottage food operation from certain requirements governing
42 food establishments. Existing law limits the definition of “cottage food operation” to a
43 natural person whose gross sales of certain food items are not more than $35,000 per
44 year. (NRS 446.866) Section 22 of this bill increases this limit on gross sales to $100,000
45 and requires the State Department of Agriculture to adjust this amount on an annual
46 basis based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items).
47 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food establishments
48 for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain conditions, including that
49 any poultry and meat from a rabbit that is served at such an event is raised and
50 prepared on the farm and is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance with
51 certain requirements relating to the inspection of meat and poultry. (NRS 446.868)
52 Section 23 of this bill provides that a farm may also serve at a farm-to-fork event: (1)
53 meat from livestock under the same circumstances; and (2) poultry, meat from livestock
54 and meat from a rabbit if the poultry or meat is obtained from a facility that meets
55 certain requirements of state law relating to the inspection of meat and poultry or from
56 a facility under a federal inspection program.
57 Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food establishment and
58 who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared or served for immediate
59 consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp to
60 manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food that contains an approved hemp
61 component at the food establishment. (NRS 446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may
62 only purchase or use hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp that the United States
63 Food and Drug Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for
64 use as an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.
