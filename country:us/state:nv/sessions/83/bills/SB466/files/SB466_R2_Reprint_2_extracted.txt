Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments,
2 cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some
4 instances, the local boards of health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-
5 44 of this bill transfer the authority for the permitting and regulation of food
6 establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events from the Division
7 to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health. Section 9
8 defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
9 Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of
10 this bill repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments.
11 Section 74 of this bill provides that any permit issued by the Division or health
12 authority pursuant to the repealed provisions of law shall remain effective until the
13 expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this bill provides that any regulation adopted
14 by a local board of health which was previously required to be approved by the
15 State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the Department. Sections 45-
16 50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to internal references to
17 reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
18 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
19 regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS
20 439.200) Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt
21 regulations consistent with law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
22 food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410) Section 14 of this bill transfers the
23 authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
24 food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department. Sections 61 and
25 62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health relating
26 to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
27 regulations adopted by the Department.
28 Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an
29 amount determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county
30 by the Division, including services relating to food establishments. Existing law
31 authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive an exemption
32 from this assessment from the Interim Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905)
33 Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an assessment for the costs of
34 any services provided in the county by the Department relating to food
35 establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and
36 receive an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 15 also
37 authorizes the Department to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out the
38 provisions of the section which, if adopted, must ensure the financial solvency of
39 the Department in providing such services. Section 51 of this bill authorizes the
40 Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or special session.
41 Section 75.5 of this bill requires the State Department of Agriculture to review the
42 budget of the Department, any fee charged to a food establishment by the Division
43 and the assessments paid to the Division for the costs of services provided to a
44 county by the Division relating to food establishments to determine the amount of
45 the assessments that are necessary to ensure the financial solvency of the
46 Department in providing such services and, based on the results of the review, the
47 Department may increase the assessments required by section 15. Section 76 of
48 this bill provides that any county which has already received such an exemption
49 shall be deemed to have received an exemption from the assessment required by
50 section 15.
51 Existing law exempts a cottage food operation from certain requirements
52 governing food establishments. Existing law limits the definition of “cottage food
53 operation” to a natural person whose gross sales of certain food items are not more
54 than $35,000 per year. (NRS 446.866) Section 22 of this bill increases this limit on
-
*SB466_R2*
– 3 –
55 gross sales to $100,000 and requires the State Department of Agriculture to adjust
56 this amount on an annual basis based on the percentage increase in the Consumer
57 Price Index (All Items).
58 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
59 establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
60 conditions, including that any poultry and meat from a rabbit that is served at such
61 an event is raised and prepared on the farm and is butchered and processed on the
62 farm in accordance with certain requirements relating to the inspection of meat and
63 poultry. (NRS 446.868) Section 23 of this bill provides that a farm may also serve
64 at a farm-to-fork event: (1) meat from livestock under the same circumstances; and
65 (2) poultry, meat from livestock and meat from a rabbit if the poultry or meat is
66 obtained from a facility that meets certain requirements of state law relating to the
67 inspection of meat and poultry or from a facility under a federal inspection
68 program.
69 Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food
70 establishment and who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared
71 or served for immediate consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or
72 product made using hemp to manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food
73 that contains an approved hemp component at the food establishment. (NRS
74 446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may only purchase or use hemp or a
75 commodity or product made using hemp that the United States Food and Drug
76 Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for use as
77 an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments,
2 cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services and, in some
4 instances, the local boards of health. (Chapter 446 of NRS) Sections 2-13 and 16-
5 44 of this bill transfer the authority for the permitting and regulation of food
6 establishments, cottage food operations and farm-to-fork events from the Division
7 to the State Department of Agriculture and the local boards of health. Section 9
8 defines the term “food safety authority” to mean the officers and agents of the
9 Department or the officers and agents of the local boards of health. Section 77 of
10 this bill repeals the existing provisions of law governing food establishments.
11 Section 74 of this bill provides that any permit issued by the Division or health
12 authority pursuant to the repealed provisions of law shall remain effective until the
13 expiration of the permit. Section 75 of this bill provides that any regulation adopted
14 by a local board of health which was previously required to be approved by the
15 State Board of Health shall be deemed approved by the Department. Sections 45-
16 50, 52-60 and 63-70 of this bill make conforming changes to internal references to
17 reflect the transfer of authority to the Department.
18 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt, amend and enforce
19 regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and food supplies. (NRS
20 439.200) Existing law further authorizes a district board of health to adopt
21 regulations consistent with law to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
22 food supplies. (NRS 439.366, 439.410) Section 14 of this bill transfers the
23 authority to adopt regulations to provide for the sanitary protection of water and
24 food supplies from the State Board of Health to the Department. Sections 61 and
25 62 of this bill require any regulations adopted by a district board of health relating
26 to the sanitary protection of water and food supplies to be consistent with any
27 regulations adopted by the Department.
28 Existing law requires each county to pay an assessment to the Division in an
29 amount determined by the Division for the costs of services provided in that county
30 by the Division, including services relating to food establishments. Existing law
31 authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and receive an exemption
32 from this assessment from the Interim Finance Committee. (NRS 439.4905)
33 Section 15 of this bill requires each county to pay an assessment for the costs of
34 any services provided in the county by the Department relating to food
35 establishments and authorizes a county to request to carry out these services and
36 receive an exemption from the Interim Finance Committee. Section 15 also
37 authorizes the Department to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out the
38 provisions of the section which, if adopted, must ensure the financial solvency of
39 the Department in providing such services. Section 51 of this bill authorizes the
40 Interim Finance Committee to perform this duty during a regular or special session.
41 Section 75.5 of this bill requires the State Department of Agriculture to review the
42 budget of the Department, any fee charged to a food establishment by the Division
43 and the assessments paid to the Division for the costs of services provided to a
44 county by the Division relating to food establishments to determine the amount of
45 the assessments that are necessary to ensure the financial solvency of the
46 Department in providing such services and, based on the results of the review, the
47 Department may increase the assessments required by section 15. Section 76 of
48 this bill provides that any county which has already received such an exemption
49 shall be deemed to have received an exemption from the assessment required by
50 section 15.
51 Existing law exempts a cottage food operation from certain requirements
52 governing food establishments. Existing law limits the definition of “cottage food
53 operation” to a natural person whose gross sales of certain food items are not more
54 than $35,000 per year. (NRS 446.866) Section 22 of this bill increases this limit on
-

– 3 –
55 gross sales to $100,000 and requires the State Department of Agriculture to adjust
56 this amount on an annual basis based on the percentage increase in the Consumer
57 Price Index (All Items).
58 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
59 establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
60 conditions, including that any poultry and meat from a rabbit that is served at such
61 an event is raised and prepared on the farm and is butchered and processed on the
62 farm in accordance with certain requirements relating to the inspection of meat and
63 poultry. (NRS 446.868) Section 23 of this bill provides that a farm may also serve
64 at a farm-to-fork event: (1) meat from livestock under the same circumstances; and
65 (2) poultry, meat from livestock and meat from a rabbit if the poultry or meat is
66 obtained from a facility that meets certain requirements of state law relating to the
67 inspection of meat and poultry or from a facility under a federal inspection
68 program.
69 Existing law authorizes a person who holds a permit to operate a food
70 establishment and who operates a food establishment at which food is not prepared
71 or served for immediate consumption to purchase and use hemp or a commodity or
72 product made using hemp to manufacture or prepare and sell, offer or display food
73 that contains an approved hemp component at the food establishment. (NRS
74 446.844) Section 18 provides that a person may only purchase or use hemp or a
75 commodity or product made using hemp that the United States Food and Drug
76 Administration has determined to be safe or generally recognized as safe for use as
77 an ingredient in food intended for human consumption.
