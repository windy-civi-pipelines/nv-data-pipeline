EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the administrators of
certain senior living facilities to ensure that such a senior
living facility is equipped with a functional ventilation
system; establishing requirements governing the detection
of carbon dioxide at such a senior living facility;
establishing requirements for the assessment of and any
repair, upgrade or installation to heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning systems at such senior living facilities;
requiring certain personnel to complete and review an
assessment report on such a ventilation system; requiring
the administrators of certain senior living facilities to
prepare a report on work performed on such a ventilation
system; providing that such a report is a public record;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements for certain medical facilities that
2 provide care to persons who are aged or infirm, including, without limitation, a
3 facility for intermediate care, facility for skilled nursing, a residential facility for
4 groups and a home for individual residential care. (Chapter 449 of NRS) This bill
5 establishes requirements for the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems of
6 a senior living facility.
7 Section 7 of this bill defines “senior living facility” as any facility that receives
8 any federal funding from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care program
9 and which provides living assistance and related care to a resident of the facility
10 who is an aged or infirm person, including, without limitation, a facility for
11 intermediate care, facility for skilled nursing, a residential facility for groups and a
-

– 2 –
12 home for individual residential care. Sections 3-8.7 of this bill define other terms
13 related to ventilation systems in senior living facilities.
14 Section 9 of this bill sets forth a legislative declaration relating to ventilation
15 systems in senior living facilities. Section 9.2 of this bill limits the applicability of
16 the provisions of this bill to senior living facilities located in a county whose
17 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). Section 9.5
18 of this bill requires the State Board of Health to review each new edition of certain
19 standards incorporated into this bill to determine their suitability for this State.
20 Section 10 of this bill requires, to the extent money is available, the
21 administrator of a senior living facility to ensure that the senior living facility is
22 equipped with a functional ventilation system and to have periodic assessments of
23 the existing system conducted by qualified adjusting personnel or qualified testing
24 personnel. Section 10 also authorizes a facility that is certified as an assisted living
25 facility to use certain federal money received to upgrade and maintain the
26 ventilation system of that facility.
27 Section 14 of this bill prescribes requirements governing carbon dioxide
28 detectors at a senior living facility. Section 14 also requires the administrator of a
29 senior living facility to cause an adjustment to the ventilation if the concentration of
30 carbon dioxide exceeds a certain amount.
31 Section 14.5 of this bill sets forth the requirements for qualified testing
32 personnel to assess the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system of a senior
33 living facility. Section 14.5 also requires qualified testing personnel to prepare a
34 heating, ventilation and air-conditioning assessment report, including certain
35 information relating to the assessments conducted pursuant to that section.
36 Section 18 of this bill: (1) requires a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
37 assessment report to be reviewed by a mechanical engineer; and (2) imposes certain
38 duties on the mechanical engineer to facilitate improvements determined necessary
39 based on the report.
40 Section 19 of this bill requires a senior living facility to take certain corrective
41 actions in response to a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning assessment report
42 and review by a mechanical engineer. Section 20 of this bill imposes certain
43 requirements governing the workforce used to perform such corrective actions.
44 Section 21 of this bill requires the administrator of a senior living facility to
45 prepare a report on the work performed pursuant to a heating, ventilation and air-
46 conditioning assessment report and review by a mechanical engineer and to submit
47 the report to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of
48 Health and Human Services.
49 Section 22 of this bill provides that a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
50 assessment report and a report created by an administrator of a senior living facility
51 pursuant to section 21 are public records and available for public inspection.
52 Sections 22.5 and 23 of this bill provide for the expiration of the provisions of this
53 bill where there is no longer sufficient federal money available to facilitate
54 compliance with its provisions.
