3 the various polling places in the county and city, respectively; and (2) the mail
4 ballot central counting board in such numbers determined to be required by the

11 certain pupils as trainees for the position of election board officer; and (2)

13 officers generally. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 1, 2 and 5 of this bill
