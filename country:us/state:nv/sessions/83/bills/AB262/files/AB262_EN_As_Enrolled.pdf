Assembly Bill No. 262–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; authorizing officers and trainees
appointed for certain elections to choose to work as
volunteers who receive no compensation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the county clerk of each county and the city clerk of each
city to appoint and notify registered voters to act as election board officers for: (1)
the various polling places in the county and city, respectively; and (2) the mail
ballot central counting board in such numbers determined to be required by the
volume of mail ballots required to be sent to each active registered voter in the
county or city, respectively. (NRS 293.217, 293.269929, 293C.220, 293C.26329)
Existing law further requires the compensation of voting board officers, counting
board officers, specially appointed deputy sheriffs, election board officers and other
employees to be fixed by county or city ordinance, resolution or order. (NRS
293.460) Existing law further authorizes a county or city clerk to: (1) appoint
certain pupils as trainees for the position of election board officer; and (2)
compensate such trainees for service at the same rate fixed for election board
officers generally. (NRS 293.2175, 293C.222) Sections 1, 2 and 5 of this bill
authorize a trainee, voting board officer, counting board officer or election board
officer to choose to work as a volunteer who receives no compensation.
Sections 6-8 of this bill amend the Las Vegas City Charter, the Airport
Authority Act for Battle Mountain and the Airport Authority Act for Carson City to
similarly provide that an officer appointed for certain special elections may choose
to work as a volunteer who receives no compensation. (Las Vegas City Charter §
5.130; Airport Authority Act for Battle Mountain § 21; Airport Authority Act for
Carson City § 15)
