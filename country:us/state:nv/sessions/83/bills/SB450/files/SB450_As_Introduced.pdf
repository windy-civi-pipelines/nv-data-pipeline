AN ACT relating to courts; revising provisions relating to bailiffs
and deputy marshals in certain courts; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution establishes a State Government consisting of the
2 Legislative, Executive and Judicial Departments. (Nev. Const. Art. 4, 5, 6)
3 However, the Nevada Constitution does not similarly establish local governments
4 and instead requires the Legislative Department to establish counties and townships
5 and provide by law for cities and towns. (Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 25, Art. 8, § 8)
6 Accordingly, although the Nevada Constitution contemplated the necessity of such
7 local governments, it left the creation and regulation of such bodies to the
8 Legislative Department.
9 The framers of the Nevada Constitution created a system of checks and
10 balances such that “the powers of the Government of the State of Nevada shall be
11 divided into three separate departments, the Legislative, the Executive and the
12 Judicial; and no persons charged with the exercise of powers properly belonging to
13 one of these departments shall exercise any functions, appertaining to either of the
14 others, except in the cases expressly directed or permitted in this constitution.”
15 (Nev. Const. Art. 3, §1) Based on the constitutional separation of powers, the
16 judiciary has inherent authority to manage and control its employees, including
17 their selection, appointment, promotion, discipline and termination, and if the other
18 branches of government take any legislative or executive actions that directly
19 interfere with the judiciary’s personnel decisions, such interference violates the
20 separation of powers doctrine because it unconstitutionally infringes on the
21 judiciary’s inherent authority to manage and control its employees. (City of Sparks
22 v. Sparks Mun. Court, 129 Nev. 348, 362-66 (2013))
23 However, the Nevada Supreme Court recently ruled that “local government
24 employees are distinguishable from employees of a state government department
25 for separation-of-powers purposes, and local executive department employees are
26 not within the state executive department.” (Nevada Policy Research Institute, Inc.
27 v. Miller, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 69, 558 P.3d 319, 329 (2024) (holding among other

28 things that the separation of powers doctrine did not bar certain county employees
29 whose duties were executive in nature from simultaneously serving in the
30 Legislative Department) To reach that conclusion, the Nevada Supreme Court
31 considered the separation of powers provision of the California Constitution, upon
32 which Nevada relied in drafting its own nearly identical constitutional provision.
33 (Id. (citing County of Mariposa v. Merced Irrigation Dist., 32 Cal.2d 467, 196 P.2d
34 920, 926 (1948)) (“It is settled that the separation of powers provision of the
35 [California] constitution, art. 3, § 1, does not apply to local governments as
36 distinguished from departments of the state government.”) The Nevada Supreme
37 Court adopted the position of the California Supreme Court on this issue, citing that
38 “[t]he court distinguished these state governmental powers from those established
39 for local governments subsequently created by legislative enactment and held that
40 the separation of powers governing the state did not apply to local governments.”
41 (Miller citing People ex rel. Att’y Gen. v. Provines, 34 Cal 520, 533-34) (1864))
42 Finally, the Nevada Supreme Court turned to other state high courts that have ruled
43 similarly. (Miller citing Tendler v. Thompson, 352 S.E.2d 388, 388 (Ga. 1987)
44 (“The doctrine of separation of powers applies only to the state and not to
45 municipalities or to county governments.”)
46 Under existing law, in each county whose population is 700,000 or more
47 (currently only Clark County), the judge of each district court and the justice of the
48 peace of each justice court, or the board of county commissioners under certain
49 circumstances, may appoint a deputy marshal for the court instead of a bailiff, and
50 the deputy marshal serves at the pleasure of the judge or justice making the
51 appointment. (NRS 3.310, 4.353; State ex rel. Vogel v. Grierson, No. 62225 (Nev.
52 Mar. 21, 2014) (explaining that deputy marshals “are more like employees than
53 public officers because each ‘deputy marshal serves at the pleasure of the judge he
54 or she serves.’ ”) Although existing law provides that deputy marshals serve at the
55 pleasure of the judicial officer, deputy marshals are peace officers who are
56 authorized to perform various duties that are executive in nature. (NRS 3.310,
57 4.353, 617.135)
58 This bill revises existing law relating to bailiffs and deputy marshals under
59 certain circumstances. Specifically, this bill: (1) provides that bailiffs and deputy
60 marshals in a county whose population is 700,000 or more are local government
61 employees of the county; (2) establishes provisions governing the assignment of
62 such bailiffs and deputy marshals for the court, in lieu of such persons being
63 appointed by the judge or justice of the peace; (3) removes the requirement for
64 deputy marshals to comply with any duties prescribed by the judicial officer; (4)
65 authorizes a bailiff or deputy marshal to provide service of process; and (5)
66 removes the requirement for bailiffs and deputy marshals to give a bond.
