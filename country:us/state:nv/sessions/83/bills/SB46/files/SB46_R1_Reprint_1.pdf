Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make investigations
2 and initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission if
3 the Board is satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found
4 suitable or found preliminarily suitable or which previously obtained approval for
5 an activity for which Commission approval was required or permitted should be
6 limited, conditioned, suspended, revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 1 of this
7 bill: (1) retains the jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission after a person who
8 is licensed, registered, found suitable or preliminarily found suitable is no longer
9 engaged in the activity or position for which Board or Commission approval was
10 required; (2) provides that the surrender or attempted surrender of a license,
11 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability is not
12 effective until accepted by the Board; and (3) requires the Commission to adopt
13 regulations governing such jurisdiction and the surrender or attempted surrender of
14 a license, registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability.
15 Existing law defines the term “hearing examiner” to include any person
16 authorized by the Board or the Commission to conduct investigative hearings.
17 (NRS 463.0163) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “hearing
18 examiner” to specify that such an examiner includes a person authorized by the
19 Chair of the Board or Commission. Sections 3 and 8 of this bill make similar
20 changes to provide that a hearing examiner is a person authorized by the Chair of
21 the Board. Existing law authorizes investigative hearings to be conducted by one or
22 more members of the Board with the concurrence of a majority of the Board. (NRS
23 463.110) Section 3 removes the necessity for the concurrence of a majority of the
24 Board.
25 Existing law authorizes the Board and Commission to require a finding of
26 suitability or the licensing of certain persons who own or perform certain acts
27 related to gaming. (NRS 463.162) Section 4 of this bill adds persons who conduct a
28 tournament or contest on behalf of or in conjunction with a gaming licensee to the
29 list of persons for which the Board and Commission may require a finding of
30 suitability or licensing.
31 Existing law provides that a voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does
32 not become effective until accepted in the manner prescribed by regulations
33 adopted by the Commission. (NRS 463.270) Section 5 of this bill makes a
34 conforming change to reference the regulations adopted by the Commission in
35 accordance with section 1.
36 Existing law establishes fines of not less than $25,000 and not more than
37 $250,000 for each separate violation by certain nonrestricted licensees to report and
38 maintain records of all transactions involving cash. Additionally, existing law
39 establishes fines of not more than $100,000 for certain violations which are the
40 subject of an initial complaint and not more than $250,000 for each separate
41 violation which is the subject of any subsequent complaint. (NRS 463.125,
42 463.310) Section 6 of this bill removes the separate fines for failure to maintain
43 records involving cash, and increases all fines to not more than $500,000 for each
44 separate violation which is the subject of an initial complaint and $1,000,000 for
45 each separate violation which is the subject of a subsequent complaint.
46 Existing law establishes a process for the judicial review of certain decisions by
47 the Commission, including the requirement that the Commission prepare and file
48 the record on review. (NRS 463.316, 463.3664, 463A.190) Sections 7, 8.3 and 8.7
49 of this bill: (1) require the Board or the Commission, as applicable, to transmit,
50 instead of file, the record on review to the reviewing court; and (2) provide that
51 failure of the petitioner to pay the costs and fees prescribed by the Board or the
52 Commission, as applicable, is grounds for dismissal of the petition filed with the
53 court.

54 Existing law allows a claim by a patron of a licensee for payment of a gaming
55 debt which is not evidenced by a credit instrument and which is for less than $500
56 to be resolved by a hearing examiner designated by the Board. (NRS 463.361)
57 Section 8 of this bill: (1) raises the threshold for the resolution of such a claim to
58 $1,000; and (2) provides for the designation of a hearing officer by the Chair of the
59 Board instead of the Board.
60 Existing law requires the registration or licensing of a person conducting
61 certain tournaments or contests in association with a gaming licensee. (NRS
62 463.169) Section 9 of this bill repeals that requirement, and section 4 instead
63 authorizes the Board and Commission to require a person conducting such
64 tournaments to acquire a finding of suitability or a license.
