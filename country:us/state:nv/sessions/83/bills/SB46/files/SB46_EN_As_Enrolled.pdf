Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make investigations
and initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission if
the Board is satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found
suitable or found preliminarily suitable or which previously obtained approval for
an activity for which Commission approval was required or permitted should be
limited, conditioned, suspended, revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 1 of this
bill: (1) retains the jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission after a person who
is licensed, registered, found suitable or preliminarily found suitable is no longer
engaged in the activity or position for which Board or Commission approval was
required; (2) provides that the surrender or attempted surrender of a license,
registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability is not
effective until accepted by the Board; and (3) requires the Commission to adopt
regulations governing such jurisdiction and the surrender or attempted surrender of
a license, registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability.
Existing law defines the term “hearing examiner” to include any person
authorized by the Board or the Commission to conduct investigative hearings.
(NRS 463.0163) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “hearing
examiner” to specify that such an examiner includes a person authorized by the
Chair of the Board or Commission. Sections 3 and 8 of this bill make similar
changes to provide that a hearing examiner is a person authorized by the Chair of
-

– 2 –
the Board. Existing law authorizes investigative hearings to be conducted by one or
more members of the Board with the concurrence of a majority of the Board. (NRS
463.110) Section 3 removes the necessity for the concurrence of a majority of the
Board.
Existing law authorizes the Board and Commission to require a finding of
suitability or the licensing of certain persons who own or perform certain acts
related to gaming. (NRS 463.162) Section 4 of this bill adds persons who conduct a
tournament or contest on behalf of or in conjunction with a gaming licensee to the
list of persons for which the Board and Commission may require a finding of
suitability or licensing.
Existing law provides that a voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does
not become effective until accepted in the manner prescribed by regulations
adopted by the Commission. (NRS 463.270) Section 5 of this bill makes a
conforming change to reference the regulations adopted by the Commission in
accordance with section 1.
Existing law establishes fines of not less than $25,000 and not more than
$250,000 for each separate violation by certain nonrestricted licensees to report and
maintain records of all transactions involving cash. Additionally, existing law
establishes fines of not more than $100,000 for certain violations which are the
subject of an initial complaint and not more than $250,000 for each separate
violation which is the subject of any subsequent complaint. (NRS 463.125,
463.310) Section 6 of this bill removes the separate fines for failure to maintain
records involving cash, and increases all fines to not more than $500,000 for each
separate violation which is the subject of an initial complaint and $1,000,000 for
each separate violation which is the subject of a subsequent complaint.
Existing law establishes a process for the judicial review of certain decisions by
the Commission, including the requirement that the Commission prepare and file
the record on review. (NRS 463.316, 463.3664, 463A.190) Sections 7, 8.3 and 8.7
of this bill: (1) require the Board or the Commission, as applicable, to transmit,
instead of file, the record on review to the reviewing court; and (2) provide that
failure of the petitioner to pay the costs and fees prescribed by the Board or the
Commission, as applicable, is grounds for dismissal of the petition filed with the
court.
Existing law allows a claim by a patron of a licensee for payment of a gaming
debt which is not evidenced by a credit instrument and which is for less than $500
to be resolved by a hearing examiner designated by the Board. (NRS 463.361)
Section 8 of this bill: (1) raises the threshold for the resolution of such a claim to
$1,000; and (2) provides for the designation of a hearing officer by the Chair of the
Board instead of the Board.
Existing law requires the registration or licensing of a person conducting
certain tournaments or contests in association with a gaming licensee. (NRS
463.169) Section 9 of this bill repeals that requirement, and section 4 instead
authorizes the Board and Commission to require a person conducting such
tournaments to acquire a finding of suitability or a license.

NRS 463.650.
(e) Who is found suitable by the Commission to act as an
independent agent.
 Receipts or rentals or charges for real property, personal property

adjustments in charges, rentals or fees on account of changes in
taxes or assessments, escalations in the cost-of-living index,
expansions or improvement of facilities, or changes in services
supplied. Receipts of rentals or charges based on percentage

with that person without the prior approval of the Commission. Any
other agreement between the licensee and that person must be
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 6 –
terminated upon receipt of notice of the action by the Commission.
Any agreement between a licensee and a person described in
subsection 5 shall be deemed to include a provision for its
termination without liability on the part of the licensee upon a
finding by the Commission that the person is unsuitable. Failure
expressly to include that condition in the agreement is not a defense
in any action brought pursuant to this section to terminate the
agreement. If the application is not presented to the Board within 30
days after demand, the Commission may pursue any remedy or
combination of remedies provided in this chapter.
Sec. 5. NRS 463.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
463.270 1. Subject to the power of the Commission to deny,

at the times respectively provided shall pay in addition to such
license fees or taxes a penalty of not less than $50 or 25 percent of
the amount due, whichever is the greater, but not more than $1,000

surrender of the license.
