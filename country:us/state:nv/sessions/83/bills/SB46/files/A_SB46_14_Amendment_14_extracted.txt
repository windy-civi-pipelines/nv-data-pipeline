Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make investigations and
2 initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission if the Board is
3 satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found suitable or found
4 preliminarily suitable or which previously obtained approval for an activity for which
5 Commission approval was required or permitted should be limited, conditioned, suspended,
6 revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 1 of this bill : (1) retains the jurisdiction of the
7 Board and the Commission after a person who is licensed, registered, found suitable or
8 preliminarily found suitable is no longer engaged in the activity or position for which Board
9 or Commission approval was required [. Section 1 also] ; (2) provides that the surrender or
Senate Amendment No. 14 to Senate Bill No. 46 Page 4
10 attempted surrender of a license, registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of
11 suitability is not effective until accepted by the Board [in the manner prescribed by the Chair
12 of the Board .] ; and (3) requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing such
13 jurisdiction and the surrender or attempted surrender of a license, registration, finding
14 of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability.
15 Existing law defines the term “hearing examiner” to include any person authorized by the
16 Board or the Commission to conduct investigative hearings. (NRS 463.0163) Section 2 of this
17 bill revises the definition of the term “hearing examiner” to specify that such an examiner
18 includes a person authorized by the Chair of the Board or Commission. Sections 3 and 8 of
19 this bill make similar changes to provide that a hearing examiner is a person authorized by the
20 Chair of the Board. Existing law authorizes investigative hearings to be conducted by one or
21 more members of the Board with the concurrence of a majority of the Board. (NRS 463.110)
22 Section 3 removes the necessity for the concurrence of a majority of the Board.
23 Existing law authorizes the Board and Commission to require a finding of suitability or
24 the licensing of certain persons who own or perform certain acts related to gaming. (NRS
25 463.162) Section 4 of this bill adds persons who conduct a tournament or contest on behalf of
26 or in conjunction with a gaming licensee to the list of persons for which the Board and
27 Commission may require a finding of suitability or licensing.
28 Existing law provides that a voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not
29 become effective until accepted in the manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the
30 Commission. (NRS 463.270) Section 5 of this bill [instead provides that such a voluntary
31 surrender does not become effective until accepted by the Board in the manner prescribed by
32 the Chair of the Board.] makes a conforming change to reference the regulations adopted
33 by the Commission in accordance with section 1.
34 Existing law establishes fines of not less than $25,000 and not more than $250,000 for
35 each separate violation by certain nonrestricted licensees to report and maintain records of all
36 transactions involving cash. Additionally, existing law establishes fines of not more than
37 $100,000 for certain violations which are the subject of an initial complaint and not more than
38 $250,000 for each separate violation which is the subject of any subsequent complaint. (NRS
39 463.125, 463.310) Section 6 of this bill removes the separate fines for failure to maintain
40 records involving cash, and increases all fines to not more than $500,000 for each separate
41 violation which is the subject of an initial complaint and $1,000,000 for each separate
42 violation which is the subject of a subsequent complaint.
43 Existing law establishes a process for the judicial review of certain decisions by the
44 Commission, including the requirement that the Commission [must] prepare and file the
45 record on review. (NRS 463.316 [) Section] , 463.3664, 463A.190) Sections 7 , 8.3 and 8.7 of
46 this bill: (1) [requires] require the Board or the Commission , as applicable, to transmit,
47 instead of file, the record on review to the reviewing court; and (2) [provides] provide that
48 failure of the petitioner to pay the costs and fees prescribed by the Board or the Commission ,
49 as applicable, is grounds for dismissal of the petition filed with the court.
50 Existing law allows a claim by a patron of a licensee for payment of a gaming debt which
51 is not evidenced by a credit instrument and which is for less than $500 to be resolved by a
52 hearing examiner designated by the Board. (NRS 463.361) Section 8 of this bill: (1) raises the
53 threshold for the resolution of such a claim to $1,000; and (2) provides for the designation of a
54 hearing officer by the Chair of the Board instead of the Board.
55 Existing law requires the registration or licensing of a person conducting certain
56 tournaments or contests in association with a gaming licensee. (NRS 463.169) Section 9 of
57 this bill repeals that requirement, and section 4 instead authorizes the Board and Commission
58 to require a person conducting such tournaments to acquire a finding of suitability or a
59 license.

6 subsection 5 shall be deemed to include a provision for its termination without
7 liability on the part of the licensee upon a finding by the Commission that the

12 provided in this chapter.

41 penalties which would have been due upon application for renewal.
42 7. If any licensee or other person fails to renew his or her license as provided
43 in this section, the Commission may order the immediate closure of all his or her
44 gaming activity until the license is renewed by the payment of the necessary fees,
45 taxes, interest and any penalties. Except for a license for which fees are based on
46 the gross revenue of the licensee, failure to renew a license within 30 days after the
47 date required by this chapter shall be deemed a surrender of the license.
48 8. The voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not become
49 effective until accepted [by the Board] in the manner provided in the regulations of
50 the Commission [. established by the Chair of the Board.] adopted in accordance
51 with section 1 of this act. The surrender of a license does not relieve the former
52 licensee of any penalties, fines, fees, taxes or interest due.

_______________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing gaming. (BDR 41-298)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to gaming; retaining the jurisdiction of the Nevada Gaming
Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission under certain
circumstances; requiring the Commission to adopt regulations
governing such jurisdiction and the surrender or attempted
surrender of a license, registration, finding of suitability or
preliminary finding of suitability; revising the definition of “hearing
examiner”; revising certain provisions governing investigative hearings
and judicial review related to the licensing and control of gaming;
authorizing the Board and Commission to require a finding of
suitability or the licensing of any person who conducts a tournament or
contest on behalf of or in conjunction with a gaming licensee; revising
provisions governing the voluntary surrender of a gaming license;
revising the fines for certain violations relating to the licensing and
control of gaming; revising provisions governing the judicial review of
certain decisions by the Board and the Commission; revising
provisions relating to the resolution of certain claims by patrons
regarding gaming debts; repealing provisions governing the
registration or licensing of persons conducting certain tournaments or
contests in association with a gaming licensee; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make investigations and
2 initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission if the Board is
3 satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found suitable or found
4 preliminarily suitable or which previously obtained approval for an activity for which
5 Commission approval was required or permitted should be limited, conditioned, suspended,
6 revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 1 of this bill : (1) retains the jurisdiction of the
7 Board and the Commission after a person who is licensed, registered, found suitable or
8 preliminarily found suitable is no longer engaged in the activity or position for which Board
9 or Commission approval was required [. Section 1 also] ; (2) provides that the surrender or

Senate Amendment No. 14 to Senate Bill No. 46 Page 4
10 attempted surrender of a license, registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of
11 suitability is not effective until accepted by the Board [in the manner prescribed by the Chair
12 of the Board .] ; and (3) requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing such
13 jurisdiction and the surrender or attempted surrender of a license, registration, finding
14 of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability.
15 Existing law defines the term “hearing examiner” to include any person authorized by the
16 Board or the Commission to conduct investigative hearings. (NRS 463.0163) Section 2 of this
17 bill revises the definition of the term “hearing examiner” to specify that such an examiner
18 includes a person authorized by the Chair of the Board or Commission. Sections 3 and 8 of
19 this bill make similar changes to provide that a hearing examiner is a person authorized by the
20 Chair of the Board. Existing law authorizes investigative hearings to be conducted by one or
21 more members of the Board with the concurrence of a majority of the Board. (NRS 463.110)
22 Section 3 removes the necessity for the concurrence of a majority of the Board.
23 Existing law authorizes the Board and Commission to require a finding of suitability or
24 the licensing of certain persons who own or perform certain acts related to gaming. (NRS
25 463.162) Section 4 of this bill adds persons who conduct a tournament or contest on behalf of
26 or in conjunction with a gaming licensee to the list of persons for which the Board and
27 Commission may require a finding of suitability or licensing.
28 Existing law provides that a voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not
29 become effective until accepted in the manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the
30 Commission. (NRS 463.270) Section 5 of this bill [instead provides that such a voluntary
31 surrender does not become effective until accepted by the Board in the manner prescribed by
32 the Chair of the Board.] makes a conforming change to reference the regulations adopted
33 by the Commission in accordance with section 1.
34 Existing law establishes fines of not less than $25,000 and not more than $250,000 for
35 each separate violation by certain nonrestricted licensees to report and maintain records of all
36 transactions involving cash. Additionally, existing law establishes fines of not more than
37 $100,000 for certain violations which are the subject of an initial complaint and not more than
38 $250,000 for each separate violation which is the subject of any subsequent complaint. (NRS
39 463.125, 463.310) Section 6 of this bill removes the separate fines for failure to maintain
40 records involving cash, and increases all fines to not more than $500,000 for each separate
41 violation which is the subject of an initial complaint and $1,000,000 for each separate
42 violation which is the subject of a subsequent complaint.
43 Existing law establishes a process for the judicial review of certain decisions by the
44 Commission, including the requirement that the Commission [must] prepare and file the
45 record on review. (NRS 463.316 [) Section] , 463.3664, 463A.190) Sections 7 , 8.3 and 8.7 of
46 this bill: (1) [requires] require the Board or the Commission , as applicable, to transmit,
47 instead of file, the record on review to the reviewing court; and (2) [provides] provide that
48 failure of the petitioner to pay the costs and fees prescribed by the Board or the Commission ,
49 as applicable, is grounds for dismissal of the petition filed with the court.
50 Existing law allows a claim by a patron of a licensee for payment of a gaming debt which
51 is not evidenced by a credit instrument and which is for less than $500 to be resolved by a
52 hearing examiner designated by the Board. (NRS 463.361) Section 8 of this bill: (1) raises the
53 threshold for the resolution of such a claim to $1,000; and (2) provides for the designation of a
54 hearing officer by the Chair of the Board instead of the Board.
55 Existing law requires the registration or licensing of a person conducting certain
56 tournaments or contests in association with a gaming licensee. (NRS 463.169) Section 9 of
57 this bill repeals that requirement, and section 4 instead authorizes the Board and Commission
58 to require a person conducting such tournaments to acquire a finding of suitability or a
59 license.

Senate Amendment No. 14 to Senate Bill No. 46 Page 6
1 (b) Lend, let, lease or otherwise deliver or furnish, except by a bona fide sale or
2 capital lease, any slot machine under guise of any agreement whereby any
3 consideration is paid or is payable for the right to possess or use that slot machine,

28 index, expansions or improvement of facilities, or changes in services supplied.

1 6. If the Commission finds a person described in subsection 5 unsuitable, a
2 licensee shall not enter into any contract or agreement with that person without the
3 prior approval of the Commission. Any other agreement between the licensee and
4 that person must be terminated upon receipt of notice of the action by the
5 Commission. Any agreement between a licensee and a person described in
6 subsection 5 shall be deemed to include a provision for its termination without
7 liability on the part of the licensee upon a finding by the Commission that the
8 person is unsuitable. Failure expressly to include that condition in the agreement is
9 not a defense in any action brought pursuant to this section to terminate the
10 agreement. If the application is not presented to the Board within 30 days after
11 demand, the Commission may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies
12 provided in this chapter.
13 Sec. 5. NRS 463.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 463.270 1. Subject to the power of the Commission to deny, revoke,

17 renewal and payment of state license fees and taxes as required by law and the
18 regulations of the Commission.
19 2. All state gaming licenses are subject to renewal on the first day of each
20 January and all quarterly state gaming licenses on the first day of each calendar
21 quarter thereafter.
22 3. Application for renewal must be filed with the Commission, and all state
23 license fees and taxes required by law, including, without limitation, NRS
24 368A.200, 463.370, 463.373 to 463.3855, inclusive, 463.660, 464.015 and 464.040,
25 must be paid to the Board on or before the dates respectively provided by law for
26 each fee or tax.
27 4. Application for renewal of licenses for slot machines only must be made by
28 the operators of the locations where such machines are situated.
29 5. Any person failing to pay any state license fees or taxes due at the times
30 respectively provided shall pay in addition to such license fees or taxes a penalty of
31 not less than $50 or 25 percent of the amount due, whichever is the greater, but not
32 more than $1,000 if the fees or taxes are less than 10 days late and in no case in
33 excess of $5,000. The penalty must be collected as are other charges, license fees
34 and penalties under this chapter.
35 6. Any person who operates, carries on or exposes for play any gambling
36 game, gaming device or slot machine or who manufactures, sells or distributes any
37 gaming device, equipment, material or machine used in gaming after the person’s
38 license becomes subject to renewal, and thereafter fails to apply for renewal as
39 provided in this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition to the penalties
40 provided by law, is liable to the State of Nevada for all license fees, taxes and
41 penalties which would have been due upon application for renewal.
42 7. If any licensee or other person fails to renew his or her license as provided
43 in this section, the Commission may order the immediate closure of all his or her
44 gaming activity until the license is renewed by the payment of the necessary fees,
45 taxes, interest and any penalties. Except for a license for which fees are based on
46 the gross revenue of the licensee, failure to renew a license within 30 days after the
47 date required by this chapter shall be deemed a surrender of the license.
48 8. The voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not become
49 effective until accepted [by the Board] in the manner provided in the regulations of
50 the Commission [. established by the Chair of the Board.] adopted in accordance
51 with section 1 of this act. The surrender of a license does not relieve the former
52 licensee of any penalties, fines, fees, taxes or interest due.

Senate Amendment No. 14 to Senate Bill No. 46 Page 8

18 preliminarily suitable pursuant to this chapter or chapter 464 of NRS or which
19 previously obtained approval for any act or transaction for which Commission
20 approval was required or permitted under the provisions of this chapter or chapter
21 464 of NRS should be fined,
22  the Board shall initiate a hearing before the Commission by filing a complaint
23 with the Commission in accordance with NRS 463.312 and transmit therewith a
24 summary of evidence in its possession bearing on the matter and the transcript of
