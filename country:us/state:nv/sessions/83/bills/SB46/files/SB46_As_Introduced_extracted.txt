Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make investigations
2 and initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission if
3 the Board is satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found
-
*SB46*
– 2 –
4 suitable or found preliminarily suitable or which previously obtained approval for
5 an activity for which Commission approval was required or permitted should be
6 limited, conditioned, suspended, revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 1 of this
7 bill retains the jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission after a person who is
8 licensed, registered, found suitable or preliminarily found suitable is no longer
9 engaged in the activity or position for which Commission approval was required.
10 Section 1 also provides that the surrender or attempted surrender of a license,
11 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability is not
12 effective until accepted by the Board in the manner prescribed by the Chair of the
13 Board.
14 Existing law defines the term “hearing examiner” to include any person
15 authorized by the Board or the Commission to conduct investigative hearings.
16 (NRS 463.0163) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “hearing
17 examiner” to specify that such an examiner includes a person authorized by the
18 Chair of the Board or Commission. Sections 3 and 8 of this bill make similar
19 changes to provide that a hearing examiner is a person authorized by the Chair of
20 the Board. Existing law authorizes investigative hearings to be conducted by one or
21 more members of the Board with the concurrence of a majority of the Board. (NRS
22 463.110) Section 3 removes the necessity for the concurrence of a majority of the
23 Board.
24 Existing law authorizes the Board and Commission to require a finding of
25 suitability or the licensing of certain persons who own or perform certain acts
26 related to gaming. (NRS 463.162) Section 4 of this bill adds persons who conduct a
27 tournament or contest on behalf of or in conjunction with a gaming licensee to the
28 list of persons for which the Board and Commission may require a finding of
29 suitability or licensing.
30 Existing law provides that a voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does
31 not become effective until accepted in the manner prescribed by regulations
32 adopted by the Commission. (NRS 463.270) Section 5 of this bill instead provides
33 that such a voluntary surrender does not become effective until accepted by the
34 Board in the manner prescribed by the Chair of the Board.
35 Existing law establishes fines of not less than $25,000 and not more than
36 $250,000 for each separate violation by certain nonrestricted licensees to report and
37 maintain records of all transactions involving cash. Additionally, existing law
38 establishes fines of not more than $100,000 for certain violations which are the
39 subject of an initial complaint and not more than $250,000 for each separate
40 violation which is the subject of any subsequent complaint. (NRS 463.125,
41 463.310) Section 6 of this bill removes the separate fines for failure to maintain
42 records involving cash, and increases all fines to not more than $500,000 for each
43 separate violation which is the subject of an initial complaint and $1,000,000 for
44 each separate violation which is the subject of a subsequent complaint.
45 Existing law establishes a process for the judicial review of decisions by the
46 Commission, including the requirement that the Commission must prepare and file
47 the record on review. (NRS 463.316) Section 7 of this bill: (1) requires the
48 Commission to transmit, instead of file, the record on review to the reviewing
49 court; and (2) provides that failure of the petitioner to pay the costs and fees
50 prescribed by the Commission is grounds for dismissal of the petition filed with the
51 court.
52 Existing law allows a claim by a patron of a licensee for payment of a gaming
53 debt which is not evidenced by a credit instrument and which is for less than $500
54 to be resolved by a hearing examiner designated by the Board. (NRS 463.361)
55 Section 8 of this bill: (1) raises the threshold for the resolution of such a claim to
56 $1,000; and (2) provides for the designation of a hearing officer by the Chair of the
57 Board instead of the Board.

58 Existing law requires the registration or licensing of a person conducting
59 certain tournaments or contests in association with a gaming licensee. (NRS
60 463.169) Section 9 of this bill repeals that requirement, and section 4 instead
61 authorizes the Board and Commission to require a person conducting such
62 tournaments to acquire a finding of suitability or license.

10 bona fide sale or capital lease, any slot machine under guise of any
11 agreement whereby any consideration is paid or is payable for the

11 suitability or the licensing of any person who:
12 (a) Owns any interest in the premises of a licensed establishment
13 or owns any interest in real property used by a licensed

31 other agreement between the licensee and that person must be
32 terminated upon receipt of notice of the action by the Commission.
33 Any agreement between a licensee and a person described in
34 subsection 5 shall be deemed to include a provision for its
35 termination without liability on the part of the licensee upon a
36 finding by the Commission that the person is unsuitable. Failure
37 expressly to include that condition in the agreement is not a defense
38 in any action brought pursuant to this section to terminate the
39 agreement. If the application is not presented to the Board within 30
40 days after demand, the Commission may pursue any remedy or
41 combination of remedies provided in this chapter.

28 as provided in this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in

30 Nevada for all license fees, taxes and penalties which would have
31 been due upon application for renewal.
32 7. If any licensee or other person fails to renew his or her
33 license as provided in this section, the Commission may order the
34 immediate closure of all his or her gaming activity until the license
35 is renewed by the payment of the necessary fees, taxes, interest and
36 any penalties. Except for a license for which fees are based on the
37 gross revenue of the licensee, failure to renew a license within 30
38 days after the date required by this chapter shall be deemed a
39 surrender of the license.
40 8. The voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not
41 become effective until accepted by the Board in the manner
42 [provided in the regulations of the Commission.] established by the
43 Chair of the Board. The surrender of a license does not relieve the
44 former licensee of any penalties, fines, fees, taxes or interest due.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Nevada Gaming Control Board to make investigations
2 and initiate a hearing by filing a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission if
3 the Board is satisfied that a person or entity which is licensed, registered, found
-
*SB46*

– 2 –
4 suitable or found preliminarily suitable or which previously obtained approval for
5 an activity for which Commission approval was required or permitted should be
6 limited, conditioned, suspended, revoked or fined. (NRS 463.310) Section 1 of this
7 bill retains the jurisdiction of the Board and the Commission after a person who is
8 licensed, registered, found suitable or preliminarily found suitable is no longer
9 engaged in the activity or position for which Commission approval was required.
10 Section 1 also provides that the surrender or attempted surrender of a license,
11 registration, finding of suitability or preliminary finding of suitability is not
12 effective until accepted by the Board in the manner prescribed by the Chair of the
13 Board.
14 Existing law defines the term “hearing examiner” to include any person
15 authorized by the Board or the Commission to conduct investigative hearings.
16 (NRS 463.0163) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “hearing
17 examiner” to specify that such an examiner includes a person authorized by the
18 Chair of the Board or Commission. Sections 3 and 8 of this bill make similar
19 changes to provide that a hearing examiner is a person authorized by the Chair of
20 the Board. Existing law authorizes investigative hearings to be conducted by one or
21 more members of the Board with the concurrence of a majority of the Board. (NRS
22 463.110) Section 3 removes the necessity for the concurrence of a majority of the
23 Board.
24 Existing law authorizes the Board and Commission to require a finding of
25 suitability or the licensing of certain persons who own or perform certain acts
26 related to gaming. (NRS 463.162) Section 4 of this bill adds persons who conduct a
27 tournament or contest on behalf of or in conjunction with a gaming licensee to the
28 list of persons for which the Board and Commission may require a finding of
29 suitability or licensing.
30 Existing law provides that a voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does
31 not become effective until accepted in the manner prescribed by regulations
32 adopted by the Commission. (NRS 463.270) Section 5 of this bill instead provides
33 that such a voluntary surrender does not become effective until accepted by the
34 Board in the manner prescribed by the Chair of the Board.
35 Existing law establishes fines of not less than $25,000 and not more than
36 $250,000 for each separate violation by certain nonrestricted licensees to report and
37 maintain records of all transactions involving cash. Additionally, existing law
38 establishes fines of not more than $100,000 for certain violations which are the
39 subject of an initial complaint and not more than $250,000 for each separate
40 violation which is the subject of any subsequent complaint. (NRS 463.125,
41 463.310) Section 6 of this bill removes the separate fines for failure to maintain
42 records involving cash, and increases all fines to not more than $500,000 for each
43 separate violation which is the subject of an initial complaint and $1,000,000 for
44 each separate violation which is the subject of a subsequent complaint.
45 Existing law establishes a process for the judicial review of decisions by the
46 Commission, including the requirement that the Commission must prepare and file
47 the record on review. (NRS 463.316) Section 7 of this bill: (1) requires the
48 Commission to transmit, instead of file, the record on review to the reviewing
49 court; and (2) provides that failure of the petitioner to pay the costs and fees
50 prescribed by the Commission is grounds for dismissal of the petition filed with the
51 court.
52 Existing law allows a claim by a patron of a licensee for payment of a gaming
53 debt which is not evidenced by a credit instrument and which is for less than $500
54 to be resolved by a hearing examiner designated by the Board. (NRS 463.361)
55 Section 8 of this bill: (1) raises the threshold for the resolution of such a claim to
56 $1,000; and (2) provides for the designation of a hearing officer by the Chair of the
57 Board instead of the Board.
-
*SB46*

– 3 –
58 Existing law requires the registration or licensing of a person conducting
59 certain tournaments or contests in association with a gaming licensee. (NRS
60 463.169) Section 9 of this bill repeals that requirement, and section 4 instead
61 authorizes the Board and Commission to require a person conducting such
62 tournaments to acquire a finding of suitability or license.

– 4 –
1 Sec. 4. NRS 463.162 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 463.162 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 and
3 3 and NRS 463.1725, it is unlawful for any person to:
4 (a) Lend, let, lease or otherwise deliver or furnish any
5 equipment of any gambling game, including any slot machine, for
6 any interest, percentage or share of the money or property played,
7 under guise of any agreement whatever, without having first
8 procured a state gaming license.
9 (b) Lend, let, lease or otherwise deliver or furnish, except by a
10 bona fide sale or capital lease, any slot machine under guise of any
11 agreement whereby any consideration is paid or is payable for the
12 right to possess or use that slot machine, whether the consideration
13 is measured by a percentage of the revenue derived from the
14 machine or by a fixed fee or otherwise, without having first
15 procured a state gaming license for the slot machine.
16 (c) Furnish services or property, real or personal, on the basis of
17 a contract, lease or license, pursuant to which that person receives
18 payments based on earnings or profits from any gambling game,
19 including any slot machine, without having first procured a state
20 gaming license.
21 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any person:
22 (a) Whose payments are a fixed sum determined in advance on a
23 bona fide basis for the furnishing of services or property other than a
24 slot machine.
25 (b) Who furnishes services or property under a bona fide rental

41 taxes or assessments, escalations in the cost-of-living index,
42 expansions or improvement of facilities, or changes in services
43 supplied. Receipts of rentals or charges based on percentage
44 between a corporate licensee or a licensee who is a limited

5 requirements of subsection 1.
6 4. The Board may require any person exempted by the
7 provisions of subsection 2 or paragraph (b) of subsection 1 to
8 provide such information as it may require to perform its
9 investigative duties.
10 5. The Board and the Commission may require a finding of
11 suitability or the licensing of any person who:
12 (a) Owns any interest in the premises of a licensed establishment
13 or owns any interest in real property used by a licensed

31 other agreement between the licensee and that person must be
32 terminated upon receipt of notice of the action by the Commission.
33 Any agreement between a licensee and a person described in
34 subsection 5 shall be deemed to include a provision for its
35 termination without liability on the part of the licensee upon a
36 finding by the Commission that the person is unsuitable. Failure
37 expressly to include that condition in the agreement is not a defense
38 in any action brought pursuant to this section to terminate the
39 agreement. If the application is not presented to the Board within 30
40 days after demand, the Commission may pursue any remedy or
41 combination of remedies provided in this chapter.

5 day of each January and all quarterly state gaming licenses on the
6 first day of each calendar quarter thereafter.
7 3. Application for renewal must be filed with the Commission,
8 and all state license fees and taxes required by law, including,
9 without limitation, NRS 368A.200, 463.370, 463.373 to 463.3855,

11 on or before the dates respectively provided by law for each fee or
12 tax.

18 license fees or taxes a penalty of not less than $50 or 25 percent of

21 of $5,000. The penalty must be collected as are other charges,

23 6. Any person who operates, carries on or exposes for play any
24 gambling game, gaming device or slot machine or who
25 manufactures, sells or distributes any gaming device, equipment,
26 material or machine used in gaming after the person’s license
27 becomes subject to renewal, and thereafter fails to apply for renewal
28 as provided in this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, in
29 addition to the penalties provided by law, is liable to the State of
30 Nevada for all license fees, taxes and penalties which would have
31 been due upon application for renewal.
32 7. If any licensee or other person fails to renew his or her
33 license as provided in this section, the Commission may order the
34 immediate closure of all his or her gaming activity until the license
35 is renewed by the payment of the necessary fees, taxes, interest and
36 any penalties. Except for a license for which fees are based on the
37 gross revenue of the licensee, failure to renew a license within 30
38 days after the date required by this chapter shall be deemed a
39 surrender of the license.
40 8. The voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee does not
41 become effective until accepted by the Board in the manner
42 [provided in the regulations of the Commission.] established by the
43 Chair of the Board. The surrender of a license does not relieve the
44 former licensee of any penalties, fines, fees, taxes or interest due.
