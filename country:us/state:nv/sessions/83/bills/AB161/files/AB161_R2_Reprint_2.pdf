EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to hospice care; requiring a program of hospice
care to obtain informed consent to treatment and provide
certain notice to patients or their representatives;
providing that patients of a program for hospice care have
a right to certain care; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether
2 the program is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the
3 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
4 Services; and (2) imposes certain requirements governing the operation of a
5 program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030, 449.196) Existing law requires a
6 program of hospice care to provide certain care, and section 17 of this bill provides
7 that a patient of a program of hospice care has a right to such care. (NRS 449.196)
8 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill require a program of hospice care to inform a patient
9 of that right. Section 15 of this bill removes provisions authorizing a facility for
10 hospice care to provide certain care that the facility is required by existing law to
11 provide. Section 14 of this bill requires a program of hospice care to obtain and
12 document the informed, written consent of a patient or his or her representative for
13 all treatment and all decisions regarding the care of the patient. Section 14
14 additionally requires a program of hospice care to: (1) notify a patient or his or her
15 representative if the program has initiated filing claims for benefits on behalf of the
16 patient; (2) provide a written notice containing the contact information for the
17 program and the hours during which the program can be contacted; (3) notify a
18 patient or his or her representative not less than 7 days before the program
19 terminates the care of the patient or ceases operations; and (4) provide a written
