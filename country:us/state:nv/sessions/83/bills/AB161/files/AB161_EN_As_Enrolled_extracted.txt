CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to hospice care; requiring a program of hospice
care to obtain informed consent to treatment and provide
certain notice to patients or their representatives; providing
that patients of a program for hospice care have a right to
certain care; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether
the program is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the
Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services; and (2) imposes certain requirements governing the operation of a
program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030, 449.196) Existing law requires a
program of hospice care to provide certain care, and section 17 of this bill provides
that a patient of a program of hospice care has a right to such care. (NRS 449.196)

Section 2:
Sections 17 and 18 of this bill require a program of hospice care to inform a patient
of that right. Section 15 of this bill removes provisions authorizing a facility for
hospice care to provide certain care that the facility is required by existing law to
provide. Section 14 of this bill requires a program of hospice care to obtain and
document the informed, written consent of a patient or his or her representative for
all treatment and all decisions regarding the care of the patient. Section 14
additionally requires a program of hospice care to: (1) notify a patient or his or her
representative if the program has initiated filing claims for benefits on behalf of the
patient; (2) provide a written notice containing the contact information for the
program and the hours during which the program can be contacted; (3) notify a
patient or his or her representative not less than 7 days before the program
terminates the care of the patient or ceases operations; and (4) provide a written
notice to the patient or his or her representative upon admission outlining the right
of the patient to file a complaint against the program with the Division.
