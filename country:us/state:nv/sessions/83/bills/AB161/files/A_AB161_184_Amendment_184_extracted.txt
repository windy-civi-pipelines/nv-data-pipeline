Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether the program
2 is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services; and (2) imposes certain
4 requirements governing the operation of a program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030,
5 449.196) [Section 3 of this bill requires a program of hospice care to: (1) accept payment
6 through Medicare; and (2) be accredited by a national accrediting agency. Section 3 also
7 prohibits a program of hospice care from accepting new patients if any person who holds an
8 ownership interest in the program of at least 5 percent is under investigation for or has been
9 found to have committed a violation of federal, state or local law related to payment for health
10 care. Finally, section 3 prohibits a program of hospice care from transferring the billing
11 privileges of the program under Medicare within 60 months after: (1) being authorized to
12 accept payment through Medicare; or (2) a change in the ownership of an interest of 50
13 percent or greater in the program. Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide for the enhanced
14 oversight of a program of hospice care during the first 2 years after initial licensure.
15 Existing law requires a program of hospice care to have a medical director who is a
16 licensed physician. (NRS 449.196) Sections 8 and 14 of this bill prescribe additional required
17 qualifications of the medical director, and section 5 of this bill prescribes the duties of the
18 medical director. Section 14] Existing law requires a program of hospice care to provide
19 certain care, and section 17 of this bill provides that a patient of a program of hospice care has
20 a right to such care. (NRS 449.196) Sections 17 and 18 of this bill require a program of
21 hospice care to inform a patient of that right. Section 15 of this bill removes provisions
Assembly Amendment No. 184 to Assembly Bill No. 161 Page 4
22 authorizing a facility for hospice care to provide certain care that the facility is required by
23 [section 14] existing law to provide. Section 14 [also] of this bill requires [: (1) the
24 employees of a program of hospice care to receive certain training; and (2)] a program of
25 hospice care to obtain and document the informed, written consent of a patient or his or her
26 representative for all treatment and all decisions regarding the care of the patient. Section 14
27 [establishes certain other requirements governing the operation of] additionally requires a
28 program of hospice care [, including a requirement that the program designate an
29 interdisciplinary team to develop, review and revise a plan of care for each patient. Sections 2,

31 consistently for provisions of law regulating hospice care.
32 Section 11 requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations: (1) requiring a
33 program of hospice care to establish an independent review board to assess compliance with
34 relevant legal requirements and ethical standards; and (2) prohibiting persons with financial
35 conflicts of interest from determining or assisting in the determination of whether a person is
36 eligible to receive hospice care. Section 6 of this bill requires the Division to publish an
37 annual report concerning the ownership and licensure of each program of hospice care and the
38 results of inspections of such programs. Sections 9-13 and 16 of this bill make conforming
39 changes to establish the applicability of sections 3-6 and provide for the enforcement of
40 sections 3-6.] to: (1) notify a patient or his or her representative if the program has
41 initiated filing claims for benefits on behalf of the patient; (2) provide a written notice
42 containing the contact information for the program and the hours during which the
43 program can be contacted; (3) notify a patient or his or her representative not less than 7
44 days before the program terminates the care of the patient or ceases operations; and (4)
45 provide a written notice to the patient or his or her representative upon admission
46 outlining the right of the patient to file a complaint against the program with the
47 Division.

AN ACT relating to hospice care; requiring a program of hospice care to [accept

accepting new patients or transferring billing privileges under
Medicare in certain circumstances; providing for the enhanced
oversight of a program of hospice care during the first 2 years after

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether the program
2 is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services; and (2) imposes certain
4 requirements governing the operation of a program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030,
5 449.196) [Section 3 of this bill requires a program of hospice care to: (1) accept payment
6 through Medicare; and (2) be accredited by a national accrediting agency. Section 3 also
7 prohibits a program of hospice care from accepting new patients if any person who holds an
8 ownership interest in the program of at least 5 percent is under investigation for or has been
9 found to have committed a violation of federal, state or local law related to payment for health
10 care. Finally, section 3 prohibits a program of hospice care from transferring the billing
11 privileges of the program under Medicare within 60 months after: (1) being authorized to
12 accept payment through Medicare; or (2) a change in the ownership of an interest of 50
13 percent or greater in the program. Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide for the enhanced
14 oversight of a program of hospice care during the first 2 years after initial licensure.
15 Existing law requires a program of hospice care to have a medical director who is a
16 licensed physician. (NRS 449.196) Sections 8 and 14 of this bill prescribe additional required
17 qualifications of the medical director, and section 5 of this bill prescribes the duties of the
18 medical director. Section 14] Existing law requires a program of hospice care to provide
19 certain care, and section 17 of this bill provides that a patient of a program of hospice care has
20 a right to such care. (NRS 449.196) Sections 17 and 18 of this bill require a program of
21 hospice care to inform a patient of that right. Section 15 of this bill removes provisions

Assembly Amendment No. 184 to Assembly Bill No. 161 Page 4
22 authorizing a facility for hospice care to provide certain care that the facility is required by
23 [section 14] existing law to provide. Section 14 [also] of this bill requires [: (1) the
24 employees of a program of hospice care to receive certain training; and (2)] a program of
25 hospice care to obtain and document the informed, written consent of a patient or his or her
26 representative for all treatment and all decisions regarding the care of the patient. Section 14
27 [establishes certain other requirements governing the operation of] additionally requires a
28 program of hospice care [, including a requirement that the program designate an
29 interdisciplinary team to develop, review and revise a plan of care for each patient. Sections 2,
30 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes so that “interdisciplinary team” is defined
31 consistently for provisions of law regulating hospice care.
32 Section 11 requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations: (1) requiring a
33 program of hospice care to establish an independent review board to assess compliance with
34 relevant legal requirements and ethical standards; and (2) prohibiting persons with financial
35 conflicts of interest from determining or assisting in the determination of whether a person is
36 eligible to receive hospice care. Section 6 of this bill requires the Division to publish an
37 annual report concerning the ownership and licensure of each program of hospice care and the
38 results of inspections of such programs. Sections 9-13 and 16 of this bill make conforming
39 changes to establish the applicability of sections 3-6 and provide for the enforcement of
40 sections 3-6.] to: (1) notify a patient or his or her representative if the program has
41 initiated filing claims for benefits on behalf of the patient; (2) provide a written notice
42 containing the contact information for the program and the hours during which the
43 program can be contacted; (3) notify a patient or his or her representative not less than 7
44 days before the program terminates the care of the patient or ceases operations; and (4)
45 provide a written notice to the patient or his or her representative upon admission
46 outlining the right of the patient to file a complaint against the program with the
47 Division.
