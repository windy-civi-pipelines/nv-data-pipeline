EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to hospice care; requiring a program of hospice
care to accept payment through Medicare; prohibiting a
program of hospice care from accepting new patients or
transferring billing privileges under Medicare in certain
circumstances; providing for the enhanced oversight of a
program of hospice care during the first 2 years after
initial licensure; imposing requirements governing the
staffing and operation of a program of hospice care;
requiring the publication of an annual report of certain
information concerning programs of hospice care; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether
2 the program is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the
3 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
4 Services; and (2) imposes certain requirements governing the operation of a
5 program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030, 449.196) Section 3 of this bill
6 requires a program of hospice care to: (1) accept payment through Medicare; and
7 (2) be accredited by a national accrediting agency. Section 3 also prohibits a
8 program of hospice care from accepting new patients if any person who holds an
9 ownership interest in the program of at least 5 percent is under investigation for or
10 has been found to have committed a violation of federal, state or local law related
11 to payment for health care. Finally, section 3 prohibits a program of hospice care
12 from transferring the billing privileges of the program under Medicare within 60
13 months after: (1) being authorized to accept payment through Medicare; or (2) a
14 change in the ownership of an interest of 50 percent or greater in the program.
15 Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide for the enhanced oversight of a program of
16 hospice care during the first 2 years after initial licensure.

17 Existing law requires a program of hospice care to have a medical director who
18 is a licensed physician. (NRS 449.196) Sections 8 and 14 of this bill prescribe
19 additional required qualifications of the medical director, and section 5 of this bill
20 prescribes the duties of the medical director. Section 14 requires a program of
21 hospice care to provide certain care, and section 17 of this bill provides that a
22 patient of a program of hospice care has a right to such care. Sections 17 and 18 of
23 this bill require a program of hospice care to inform a patient of that right. Section
24 15 of this bill removes provisions authorizing a facility for hospice care to provide
25 certain care that the facility is required by section 14 to provide. Section 14 also
26 requires: (1) the employees of a program of hospice care to receive certain training;
27 and (2) a program of hospice care to obtain and document the informed, written
28 consent of a patient or his or her representative for all treatment and all decisions
29 regarding the care of the patient. Section 14 establishes certain other requirements
30 governing the operation of a program of hospice care, including a requirement that
31 the program designate an interdisciplinary team to develop, review and revise a
32 plan of care for each patient. Sections 2, 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming
33 changes so that “interdisciplinary team” is defined consistently for provisions of
34 law regulating hospice care.
35 Section 11 requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations: (1)
36 requiring a program of hospice care to establish an independent review board to
37 assess compliance with relevant legal requirements and ethical standards; and (2)
38 prohibiting persons with financial conflicts of interest from determining or assisting
39 in the determination of whether a person is eligible to receive hospice care. Section
40 6 of this bill requires the Division to publish an annual report concerning the
41 ownership and licensure of each program of hospice care and the results of
42 inspections of such programs. Sections 9-13 and 16 of this bill make conforming
43 changes to establish the applicability of sections 3-6 and provide for the
44 enforcement of sections 3-6.

A.B. 161
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 161–ASSEMBLYMEMBER EDGEWORTH
PREFILED JANUARY 30, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Makes revisions relating to hospice care.
(BDR 40-656)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to hospice care; requiring a program of hospice
care to accept payment through Medicare; prohibiting a
program of hospice care from accepting new patients or
transferring billing privileges under Medicare in certain
circumstances; providing for the enhanced oversight of a
program of hospice care during the first 2 years after
initial licensure; imposing requirements governing the
staffing and operation of a program of hospice care;
requiring the publication of an annual report of certain
information concerning programs of hospice care; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether
2 the program is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the
3 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
4 Services; and (2) imposes certain requirements governing the operation of a
5 program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030, 449.196) Section 3 of this bill
6 requires a program of hospice care to: (1) accept payment through Medicare; and
7 (2) be accredited by a national accrediting agency. Section 3 also prohibits a
8 program of hospice care from accepting new patients if any person who holds an
9 ownership interest in the program of at least 5 percent is under investigation for or
10 has been found to have committed a violation of federal, state or local law related
11 to payment for health care. Finally, section 3 prohibits a program of hospice care
12 from transferring the billing privileges of the program under Medicare within 60
13 months after: (1) being authorized to accept payment through Medicare; or (2) a
14 change in the ownership of an interest of 50 percent or greater in the program.
15 Sections 4 and 11 of this bill provide for the enhanced oversight of a program of
16 hospice care during the first 2 years after initial licensure.

*AB161*

– 2 –
17 Existing law requires a program of hospice care to have a medical director who
18 is a licensed physician. (NRS 449.196) Sections 8 and 14 of this bill prescribe
19 additional required qualifications of the medical director, and section 5 of this bill
20 prescribes the duties of the medical director. Section 14 requires a program of
21 hospice care to provide certain care, and section 17 of this bill provides that a
22 patient of a program of hospice care has a right to such care. Sections 17 and 18 of
23 this bill require a program of hospice care to inform a patient of that right. Section
24 15 of this bill removes provisions authorizing a facility for hospice care to provide
25 certain care that the facility is required by section 14 to provide. Section 14 also
26 requires: (1) the employees of a program of hospice care to receive certain training;
27 and (2) a program of hospice care to obtain and document the informed, written
28 consent of a patient or his or her representative for all treatment and all decisions
29 regarding the care of the patient. Section 14 establishes certain other requirements
30 governing the operation of a program of hospice care, including a requirement that
31 the program designate an interdisciplinary team to develop, review and revise a
32 plan of care for each patient. Sections 2, 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming
33 changes so that “interdisciplinary team” is defined consistently for provisions of
34 law regulating hospice care.
35 Section 11 requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations: (1)
36 requiring a program of hospice care to establish an independent review board to
37 assess compliance with relevant legal requirements and ethical standards; and (2)
38 prohibiting persons with financial conflicts of interest from determining or assisting
39 in the determination of whether a person is eligible to receive hospice care. Section
40 6 of this bill requires the Division to publish an annual report concerning the
41 ownership and licensure of each program of hospice care and the results of
42 inspections of such programs. Sections 9-13 and 16 of this bill make conforming
43 changes to establish the applicability of sections 3-6 and provide for the
44 enforcement of sections 3-6.
