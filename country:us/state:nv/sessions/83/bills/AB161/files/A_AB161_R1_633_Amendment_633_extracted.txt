EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to hospice care; requiring a program of hospice care to obtain
informed consent to treatment and provide certain notice to patients or
their representatives; providing that patients of a program for hospice
care have a right to certain care; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires any program of hospice care, regardless of whether the program
2 is provided by a facility for hospice care, to be licensed by the Division of Public and
3 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services; and (2) imposes certain
4 requirements governing the operation of a program of hospice care. (NRS 449.029, 449.030,
5 449.196) Existing law requires a program of hospice care to provide certain care, and section
6 17 of this bill provides that a patient of a program of hospice care has a right to such care.
7 (NRS 449.196) Sections 17 and 18 of this bill require a program of hospice care to inform a
8 patient of that right. Section 15 of this bill removes provisions authorizing a facility for
9 hospice care to provide certain care that the facility is required by existing law to provide.
10 Section 14 of this bill requires a program of hospice care to obtain and document the
11 informed, written consent of a patient or his or her representative for all treatment and all
12 decisions regarding the care of the patient. Section 14 additionally requires a program of
13 hospice care to: (1) notify a patient or his or her representative if the program has initiated
14 filing claims for benefits on behalf of the patient; (2) provide a written notice containing the
15 contact information for the program and the hours during which the program can be contacted;
16 (3) notify a patient or his or her representative not less than 7 days before the program
17 terminates the care of the patient or ceases operations; and (4) provide a written notice to the
18 patient or his or her representative upon admission outlining the right of the patient to file a
19 complaint against the program with the Division.
