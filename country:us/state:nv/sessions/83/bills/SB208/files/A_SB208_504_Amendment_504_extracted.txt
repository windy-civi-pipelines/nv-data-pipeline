SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing certain surcharges imposed by a
county. (BDR 20-677)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
[CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 2, 4)
(Not Requested by Affected Local Government)]
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the use of revenue collected by a county
from certain telephone surcharges; revising provisions governing the
fund into which such revenue is deposited; [eliminating the
authorization for a county to impose a surcharge for purposes of
purchasing or maintaining certain recording devices;] and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing federal law, the Federal Communications Commission is required to
2 regulate the use of money collected from surcharges imposed for emergency 911 service to
3 prevent diversion of those fees or charges. (47 U.S.C. § 615a-1) Existing federal regulations
4 limit the use of revenue from such fees or charges imposed by authorized taxing jurisdictions
5 to: (1) the support and implementation of emergency 911 service; and (2) the operational
6 expenses of a call center that receives and manages emergency calls, commonly known as a
7 public safety answering point. Existing federal regulations provide certain examples of
8 acceptable uses of such revenue which include, without limitation, the purchase, maintenance
9 or upgrade of buildings or facilities that contain public safety answering points. (47 C.F.R §
10 9.23)
11 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to impose a surcharge for the
12 enhancement of the telephone system for reporting an emergency or for the purchase and
13 maintenance of portable event recording devices and vehicular event recording devices if the
14 board adopts and reviews, at least annually, a 5-year master plan for the enhancement of the
15 telephone system or the purchase and maintenance of such recording devices. (NRS
16 244A.7643) If a county imposes such a surcharge, existing law requires that the revenue
17 collected from the surcharge be deposited in a special revenue fund and used only for
18 specified purposes. Existing law prescribes an order of priority for spending the money in the
19 fund for the specified purposes. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes the
20 revenue collected from the surcharge to also be used for paying any costs associated with the
21 construction , maintenance or [upgrade] operation of the portion of a facility that contains a
22 telephone system for reporting an emergency [;] and will be physically occupied by and
23 functionally dedicated to the operation of such a telephone system; and (2) prescribes the
Senate Amendment No. 504 to Senate Bill No. 208 Page 4
24 order of priority for spending the revenue collected from the surcharge for that additional
25 purpose.
26 Under existing law, if the uncommitted balance of such a special revenue fund exceeds a
27 specified monetary threshold at the end of any fiscal year, the board of county commissioners
28 is required to reduce the amount of the surcharge imposed during the next fiscal year by the
29 amount necessary to ensure that the unencumbered balance in the fund at the end of the next
30 fiscal year does not exceed the specified threshold. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 increases to
31 $15,000,000 this monetary threshold for such a special revenue fund of a county whose
32 population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County).
33 [Section 2 of this bill eliminates the authorization for a county to impose a surcharge for
34 purposes of purchasing and maintaining portable event recording devices and vehicular event
35 recording devices effective October 1, 2029. As a result of the elimination of this authority,
36 sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill remove references to these recording devices effective October
37 1, 2029. Section 6 of this bill requires a county that has an ordinance imposing a surcharge for
38 purposes of purchasing and maintaining those recording devices in effect during the period
39 between October 1, 2025, and September 30, 2029, to submit an annual report during that
40 period to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislative
41 Commission describing its activities related to the identification of an alternate source of
42 funding for purchasing and maintaining those recording devices after October 1, 2029.]
43 Section 3 also increases to $7,500,000 the monetary threshold for such a special revenue
44 fund of a county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently
45 only Washoe County).

Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing certain surcharges imposed by a
county. (BDR 20-677)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
[CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 2, 4)
(Not Requested by Affected Local Government)]
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the use of revenue collected by a county
from certain telephone surcharges; revising provisions governing the
fund into which such revenue is deposited; [eliminating the
authorization for a county to impose a surcharge for purposes of
purchasing or maintaining certain recording devices;] and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing federal law, the Federal Communications Commission is required to
2 regulate the use of money collected from surcharges imposed for emergency 911 service to
3 prevent diversion of those fees or charges. (47 U.S.C. § 615a-1) Existing federal regulations
4 limit the use of revenue from such fees or charges imposed by authorized taxing jurisdictions
5 to: (1) the support and implementation of emergency 911 service; and (2) the operational
6 expenses of a call center that receives and manages emergency calls, commonly known as a
7 public safety answering point. Existing federal regulations provide certain examples of
8 acceptable uses of such revenue which include, without limitation, the purchase, maintenance
9 or upgrade of buildings or facilities that contain public safety answering points. (47 C.F.R §
10 9.23)
11 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to impose a surcharge for the
12 enhancement of the telephone system for reporting an emergency or for the purchase and
13 maintenance of portable event recording devices and vehicular event recording devices if the
14 board adopts and reviews, at least annually, a 5-year master plan for the enhancement of the
15 telephone system or the purchase and maintenance of such recording devices. (NRS
16 244A.7643) If a county imposes such a surcharge, existing law requires that the revenue
17 collected from the surcharge be deposited in a special revenue fund and used only for
18 specified purposes. Existing law prescribes an order of priority for spending the money in the
19 fund for the specified purposes. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes the
20 revenue collected from the surcharge to also be used for paying any costs associated with the
21 construction , maintenance or [upgrade] operation of the portion of a facility that contains a
22 telephone system for reporting an emergency [;] and will be physically occupied by and
23 functionally dedicated to the operation of such a telephone system; and (2) prescribes the

Senate Amendment No. 504 to Senate Bill No. 208 Page 4
24 order of priority for spending the revenue collected from the surcharge for that additional
25 purpose.
26 Under existing law, if the uncommitted balance of such a special revenue fund exceeds a
27 specified monetary threshold at the end of any fiscal year, the board of county commissioners
28 is required to reduce the amount of the surcharge imposed during the next fiscal year by the
29 amount necessary to ensure that the unencumbered balance in the fund at the end of the next
30 fiscal year does not exceed the specified threshold. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 increases to
31 $15,000,000 this monetary threshold for such a special revenue fund of a county whose
32 population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County).
33 [Section 2 of this bill eliminates the authorization for a county to impose a surcharge for
34 purposes of purchasing and maintaining portable event recording devices and vehicular event
35 recording devices effective October 1, 2029. As a result of the elimination of this authority,
36 sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill remove references to these recording devices effective October
37 1, 2029. Section 6 of this bill requires a county that has an ordinance imposing a surcharge for
38 purposes of purchasing and maintaining those recording devices in effect during the period
39 between October 1, 2025, and September 30, 2029, to submit an annual report during that
40 period to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislative
41 Commission describing its activities related to the identification of an alternate source of
42 funding for purchasing and maintaining those recording devices after October 1, 2029.]
43 Section 3 also increases to $7,500,000 the monetary threshold for such a special revenue
44 fund of a county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently
45 only Washoe County).

28 provides mobile telephone service to a customer in such a county shall collect the
29 surcharge from its customers each month. Except as otherwise provided in NRS
