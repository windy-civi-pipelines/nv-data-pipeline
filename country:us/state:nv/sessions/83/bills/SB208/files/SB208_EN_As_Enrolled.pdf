Senate Bill No. 208–Senators Steinbeck,
Stone; and Doñate
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the use of revenue collected
by a county from certain telephone surcharges; revising
provisions governing the fund into which such revenue is
deposited; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing federal law, the Federal Communications Commission is
required to regulate the use of money collected from surcharges imposed for
emergency 911 service to prevent diversion of those fees or charges. (47 U.S.C. §
615a-1) Existing federal regulations limit the use of revenue from such fees or
charges imposed by authorized taxing jurisdictions to: (1) the support and
implementation of emergency 911 service; and (2) the operational expenses of a
call center that receives and manages emergency calls, commonly known as a
public safety answering point. Existing federal regulations provide certain
examples of acceptable uses of such revenue which include, without limitation, the
purchase, maintenance or upgrade of buildings or facilities that contain public
safety answering points. (47 C.F.R § 9.23)
Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to impose a surcharge
for the enhancement of the telephone system for reporting an emergency or for the
purchase and maintenance of portable event recording devices and vehicular event
recording devices if the board adopts and reviews, at least annually, a 5-year master
plan for the enhancement of the telephone system or the purchase and maintenance
of such recording devices. (NRS 244A.7643) If a county imposes such a surcharge,
existing law requires that the revenue collected from the surcharge be deposited in a
special revenue fund and used only for specified purposes. Existing law prescribes
an order of priority for spending the money in the fund for the specified purposes.
(NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes the revenue collected from
the surcharge to also be used for paying any costs associated with the construction,
maintenance or operation of the portion of a facility that contains a telephone
system for reporting an emergency and will be physically occupied by and
functionally dedicated to the operation of such a telephone system; and (2)
prescribes the order of priority for spending the revenue collected from the
surcharge for that additional purpose.
Under existing law, if the uncommitted balance of such a special revenue fund
exceeds a specified monetary threshold at the end of any fiscal year, the board of
county commissioners is required to reduce the amount of the surcharge imposed
during the next fiscal year by the amount necessary to ensure that the
unencumbered balance in the fund at the end of the next fiscal year does not exceed
the specified threshold. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 increases to $15,000,000 this
monetary threshold for such a special revenue fund of a county whose population is
700,000 or more (currently Clark County).
Section 3 also increases to $7,500,000 the monetary threshold for such a
special revenue fund of a county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than
700,000 (currently only Washoe County).

board of county commissioners of that county shall establish by
ordinance an advisory committee to develop a plan to enhance the
telephone system for reporting an emergency in that county and to
oversee any money allocated for that purpose. The advisory
committee must:
(a) Consist of not less than five members who:
(1) Are residents of the county;
(2) Possess knowledge concerning telephone systems for
reporting emergencies; and
(3) Are not elected public officers.
(b) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (3) of paragraph
(a), include the chief law enforcement officer or his or her designee

2. If a surcharge is imposed pursuant to NRS 244A.7643 in a
county whose population is less than 100,000, the board of county

(1) Are residents of the county;
(2) Possess knowledge concerning telephone systems for
reporting emergencies; and

this paragraph, “incumbent local exchange carrier” has the meaning
ascribed to it in 47 U.S.C. § 251(h)(1), as that section existed on
October 1, 1999, and includes a local exchange carrier that is treated
as an incumbent local exchange carrier pursuant to that section.
