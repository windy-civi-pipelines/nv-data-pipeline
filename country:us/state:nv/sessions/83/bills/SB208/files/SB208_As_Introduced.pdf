~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the use of revenue collected
by a county from certain telephone surcharges; revising
provisions governing the fund into which such revenue is
deposited; eliminating the authorization for a county to
impose a surcharge for purposes of purchasing or
maintaining certain recording devices; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing federal law, the Federal Communications Commission is
2 required to regulate the use of money collected from surcharges imposed for
3 emergency 911 service to prevent diversion of those fees or charges. (47 U.S.C. §
4 615a-1) Existing federal regulations limit the use of revenue from such fees or
5 charges imposed by authorized taxing jurisdictions to: (1) the support and
6 implementation of emergency 911 service; and (2) the operational expenses of a
7 call center that receives and manages emergency calls, commonly known as a
8 public safety answering point. Existing federal regulations provide certain
9 examples of acceptable uses of such revenue which include, without limitation, the
10 purchase, maintenance or upgrade of buildings or facilities that contain public
11 safety answering points. (47 C.F.R § 9.23)
12 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to impose a surcharge
13 for the enhancement of the telephone system for reporting an emergency or for the
14 purchase and maintenance of portable event recording devices and vehicular event
15 recording devices if the board adopts and reviews, at least annually, a 5-year master
16 plan for the enhancement of the telephone system or the purchase and maintenance
17 of such recording devices. (NRS 244A.7643) If a county imposes such a surcharge,
18 existing law requires that the revenue collected from the surcharge be deposited in a
19 special revenue fund and used only for specified purposes. Existing law prescribes
-
*SB208*

– 2 –
20 an order of priority for spending the money in the fund for the specified purposes.
21 (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes the revenue collected from
22 the surcharge to also be used for paying any costs associated with the construction
23 or upgrade of a facility that contains a telephone system for reporting an
24 emergency; and (2) prescribes the order of priority for spending the revenue
25 collected from the surcharge for that additional purpose.
26 Under existing law, if the uncommitted balance of such a special revenue fund
27 exceeds a specified monetary threshold at the end of any fiscal year, the board of
28 county commissioners is required to reduce the amount of the surcharge imposed
29 during the next fiscal year by the amount necessary to ensure that the
30 unencumbered balance in the fund at the end of the next fiscal year does not exceed
31 the specified threshold. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 increases to $15,000,000 this
32 monetary threshold for such a special revenue fund of a county whose population is
33 700,000 or more (currently Clark County).
34 Section 2 of this bill eliminates the authorization for a county to impose a
35 surcharge for purposes of purchasing and maintaining portable event recording
36 devices and vehicular event recording devices effective October 1, 2029. As a
37 result of the elimination of this authority, sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill remove
38 references to these recording devices effective October 1, 2029. Section 6 of this
39 bill requires a county that has an ordinance imposing a surcharge for purposes of
40 purchasing and maintaining those recording devices in effect during the period
41 between October 1, 2025, and September 30, 2029, to submit an annual report
42 during that period to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
43 transmission to the Legislative Commission describing its activities related to the
44 identification of an alternate source of funding for purchasing and maintaining
45 those recording devices after October 1, 2029.
