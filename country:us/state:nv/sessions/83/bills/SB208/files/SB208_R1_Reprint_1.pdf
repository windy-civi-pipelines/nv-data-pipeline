EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to counties; revising the use of revenue collected
by a county from certain telephone surcharges; revising
provisions governing the fund into which such revenue is
deposited; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing federal law, the Federal Communications Commission is
2 required to regulate the use of money collected from surcharges imposed for
3 emergency 911 service to prevent diversion of those fees or charges. (47 U.S.C. §
4 615a-1) Existing federal regulations limit the use of revenue from such fees or
5 charges imposed by authorized taxing jurisdictions to: (1) the support and
6 implementation of emergency 911 service; and (2) the operational expenses of a
7 call center that receives and manages emergency calls, commonly known as a
8 public safety answering point. Existing federal regulations provide certain
9 examples of acceptable uses of such revenue which include, without limitation, the
10 purchase, maintenance or upgrade of buildings or facilities that contain public
11 safety answering points. (47 C.F.R § 9.23)
12 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to impose a surcharge
13 for the enhancement of the telephone system for reporting an emergency or for the
14 purchase and maintenance of portable event recording devices and vehicular event
15 recording devices if the board adopts and reviews, at least annually, a 5-year master
16 plan for the enhancement of the telephone system or the purchase and maintenance
17 of such recording devices. (NRS 244A.7643) If a county imposes such a surcharge,
18 existing law requires that the revenue collected from the surcharge be deposited in a
19 special revenue fund and used only for specified purposes. Existing law prescribes
20 an order of priority for spending the money in the fund for the specified purposes.
21 (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes the revenue collected from
22 the surcharge to also be used for paying any costs associated with the construction,
23 maintenance or operation of the portion of a facility that contains a telephone
-

– 2 –
24 system for reporting an emergency and will be physically occupied by and
25 functionally dedicated to the operation of such a telephone system; and (2)
26 prescribes the order of priority for spending the revenue collected from the
27 surcharge for that additional purpose.
28 Under existing law, if the uncommitted balance of such a special revenue fund
29 exceeds a specified monetary threshold at the end of any fiscal year, the board of
30 county commissioners is required to reduce the amount of the surcharge imposed
31 during the next fiscal year by the amount necessary to ensure that the
32 unencumbered balance in the fund at the end of the next fiscal year does not exceed
33 the specified threshold. (NRS 244A.7645) Section 3 increases to $15,000,000 this
34 monetary threshold for such a special revenue fund of a county whose population is
35 700,000 or more (currently Clark County).
36 Section 3 also increases to $7,500,000 the monetary threshold for such a
37 special revenue fund of a county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than
38 700,000 (currently only Washoe County).
