AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association from retaliating against a school
or person for certain activities; prohibiting athletic recruitment;
revising provisions governing certain hearings and appeals conducted
by the Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility of
pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice in a sanctioned
sport or other interscholastic activity or event; revising requirements
relating to the adoption of regulations by the Association; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls, supervises
2 and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic events in public
3 schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and participation of certain pupils in
4 interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law
5 requires the Association to adopt rules and regulations in the same manner provided for state
6 agencies by the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS, NRS
7 385B.060) Existing regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and aligning the
8 schools within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part, require the Board of
9 Control of the Association to determine the classification and alignment of each school by
10 majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC 385B.250) Section 4.5 of this bill: (1)
11 clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of any policy, practice, rule or regulation
12 concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or school districts be accomplished by rule or
13 regulation in conformity with the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any
14 change to the classification or alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class,
15 region or league be accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the
16 Association from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who advocates for
17 or against a policy in certain circumstances.
Senate Amendment No. 615 to Assembly Bill No. 184 First Reprint Page 4
18 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the Association to
19 investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a complaint alleging a
20 violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for such a violation, including
21 providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of athletic recruitment is ineligible to
22 participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make
23 conforming changes to clarify that certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not
24 apply to a pupil who enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
25 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is presumed
26 ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the pupil transfers for
27 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to become immediately eligible to
28 participate in certain circumstances. (NAC 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a
29 pupil who is the child of a military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate
30 Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, which is an interstate compact
31 that establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families between
32 schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other
33 interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130,
34 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides [that, regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a
35 pupil is immediately eligible] a separate, one-time grant of eligibility that enables a pupil
36 to immediately participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic
37 activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers , regardless of his or her zone of
38 attendance, if he or she: (1) transfers to a school that uses a lottery system to determine which
39 pupils may enroll; or (2) transfers before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a
40 conforming change to prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures
41 or requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association pursuant to
42 section 7.
43 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain reasons and
44 seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport or interscholastic
45 activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the Association. Section 4 additionally:
46 (1) prescribes certain requirements governing the supporting documentation for such a
47 request; and (2) requires the Association to provide for procedures for reviewing such a
48 request.
49 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or order
50 made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a decision to a
51 hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the Association. Existing law
52 additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for filing such an appeal. (NRS
53 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time period within which such a hearing
54 must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or school to appeal a decision or order made by the
55 hearing officer to the school district within which the pupil is enrolled or the school is located
56 and (3) authorizes the Association to grant an appeal without appointing a hearing officer in
57 certain circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides that, in addition to a decision of the
58 Association or a designee of the Association that is authorized to make final decisions on
59 disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of a school district or its designee on an
60 appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be stayed by a court pending final judgment on the
61 matter.
62 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and regulations as
63 necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill before July 1, 2026.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association from retaliating against a school
or person for certain activities; prohibiting athletic recruitment;
revising provisions governing certain hearings and appeals conducted
by the Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility of
pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice in a sanctioned
sport or other interscholastic activity or event; revising requirements
relating to the adoption of regulations by the Association; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls, supervises
2 and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic events in public
3 schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and participation of certain pupils in
4 interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law
5 requires the Association to adopt rules and regulations in the same manner provided for state
6 agencies by the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS, NRS
7 385B.060) Existing regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and aligning the
8 schools within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part, require the Board of
9 Control of the Association to determine the classification and alignment of each school by
10 majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC 385B.250) Section 4.5 of this bill: (1)
11 clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of any policy, practice, rule or regulation
12 concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or school districts be accomplished by rule or
13 regulation in conformity with the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any
14 change to the classification or alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class,
15 region or league be accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the
16 Association from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who advocates for
17 or against a policy in certain circumstances.

Senate Amendment No. 615 to Assembly Bill No. 184 First Reprint Page 4
18 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the Association to
19 investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a complaint alleging a
20 violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for such a violation, including
21 providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of athletic recruitment is ineligible to
22 participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make
23 conforming changes to clarify that certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not
24 apply to a pupil who enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
25 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is presumed
26 ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the pupil transfers for
27 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to become immediately eligible to
28 participate in certain circumstances. (NAC 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a
29 pupil who is the child of a military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate
30 Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children, which is an interstate compact
31 that establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families between
32 schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other
33 interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130,
34 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides [that, regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a
35 pupil is immediately eligible] a separate, one-time grant of eligibility that enables a pupil
36 to immediately participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic
37 activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers , regardless of his or her zone of
38 attendance, if he or she: (1) transfers to a school that uses a lottery system to determine which
39 pupils may enroll; or (2) transfers before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a
40 conforming change to prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures
41 or requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association pursuant to
42 section 7.
43 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain reasons and
44 seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport or interscholastic
45 activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the Association. Section 4 additionally:
46 (1) prescribes certain requirements governing the supporting documentation for such a
47 request; and (2) requires the Association to provide for procedures for reviewing such a
48 request.
49 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or order
50 made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a decision to a
51 hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the Association. Existing law
52 additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for filing such an appeal. (NRS
53 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time period within which such a hearing
54 must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or school to appeal a decision or order made by the
55 hearing officer to the school district within which the pupil is enrolled or the school is located
56 and (3) authorizes the Association to grant an appeal without appointing a hearing officer in
57 certain circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides that, in addition to a decision of the
58 Association or a designee of the Association that is authorized to make final decisions on
59 disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of a school district or its designee on an
60 appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be stayed by a court pending final judgment on the
61 matter.
62 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and regulations as
63 necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill before July 1, 2026.

3 ineligibility based on transferring schools, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
4 Association approves the request pursuant to this section and the pupil is
5 otherwise eligible to participate and practice in the sanctioned sport or other
6 interscholastic activity or event. If the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
