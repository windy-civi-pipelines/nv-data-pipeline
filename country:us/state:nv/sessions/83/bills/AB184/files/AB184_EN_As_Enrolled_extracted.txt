CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association from retaliating
against a school or person for certain activities; prohibiting
athletic recruitment; revising provisions governing certain
hearings and appeals conducted by the Association; revising
provisions governing the eligibility of pupils who transfer
schools to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport or
other interscholastic activity or event; revising requirements
relating to the adoption of regulations by the Association;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls,
supervises and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic
events in public schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and
participation of certain pupils in interscholastic activities and events. (NRS
385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law requires the Association to adopt
rules and regulations in the same manner provided for state agencies by the Nevada
Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS, NRS 385B.060) Existing
regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and aligning the schools
within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part, require the Board of
Control of the Association to determine the classification and alignment of each
school by majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC 385B.250)

Section 2:
Section 4.5 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of any
policy, practice, rule or regulation concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or
school districts be accomplished by rule or regulation in conformity with the
Nevada Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any change to the
classification or alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class,
region or league be accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the
Association from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who
advocates for or against a policy in certain circumstances.

Section 3:
Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the
Association to investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a
complaint alleging a violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for
such a violation, including providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of
athletic recruitment is ineligible to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at
the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that
certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not apply to a pupil who
enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is
presumed ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the
pupil transfers for 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
become immediately eligible to participate in certain circumstances. (NAC
385B.716) However, existing law provides that a pupil who is the child of a
military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate Compact on
Educational Opportunity for Military Children, which is an interstate compact that
establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families
between schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any
sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the
pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130, 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides a
separate, one-time grant of eligibility that enables a pupil to immediately participate
and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the
school to which the pupil transfers, regardless of his or her zone of attendance, if he
or she: (1) transfers to a school that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils
may enroll; or (2) transfers before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill
makes a conforming change to prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules,
policies, procedures or requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed
by the Association pursuant to section 7.

Section 4:
Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain
reasons and seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport
or interscholastic activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the
Association. Section 4 additionally: (1) prescribes certain requirements governing
the supporting documentation for such a request; and (2) requires the Association to
provide for procedures for reviewing such a request.
Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or
order made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a
decision to a hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the
Association. Existing law additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for
filing such an appeal. (NRS 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time
period within which such a hearing must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or
school to appeal a decision or order made by the hearing officer to the school
district within which the pupil is enrolled or the school is located and (3) authorizes
the Association to grant an appeal without appointing a hearing officer in certain
circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides that, in addition to a decision of the
Association or a designee of the Association that is authorized to make final
decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of a school district or
its designee on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be stayed by a court
pending final judgment on the matter.

Section 5:
Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and
regulations as necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill
before July 1, 2026.

Assembly Bill No. 184–Assemblymembers Anderson; Dalia,
DeLong, D’Silva, Koenig, O’Neill and Torres-Fossett
Joint Sponsors: Senators Flores, Taylor;
Buck, Krasner and Neal
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association from retaliating
against a school or person for certain activities; prohibiting
athletic recruitment; revising provisions governing certain
hearings and appeals conducted by the Association; revising
provisions governing the eligibility of pupils who transfer
schools to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport or
other interscholastic activity or event; revising requirements
relating to the adoption of regulations by the Association;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls,
supervises and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic
events in public schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and
participation of certain pupils in interscholastic activities and events. (NRS
385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law requires the Association to adopt
rules and regulations in the same manner provided for state agencies by the Nevada
Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS, NRS 385B.060) Existing
regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and aligning the schools
within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part, require the Board of
Control of the Association to determine the classification and alignment of each
school by majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC 385B.250)
Section 4.5 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of any
policy, practice, rule or regulation concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or
school districts be accomplished by rule or regulation in conformity with the
Nevada Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any change to the
classification or alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class,
region or league be accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the
Association from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who
advocates for or against a policy in certain circumstances.
Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the
Association to investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a
complaint alleging a violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for
such a violation, including providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of
athletic recruitment is ineligible to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at
the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that
certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not apply to a pupil who
enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is
presumed ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the
pupil transfers for 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
become immediately eligible to participate in certain circumstances. (NAC
385B.716) However, existing law provides that a pupil who is the child of a
military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate Compact on
Educational Opportunity for Military Children, which is an interstate compact that
establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families
between schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any
sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the
pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130, 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides a
separate, one-time grant of eligibility that enables a pupil to immediately participate
and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the
school to which the pupil transfers, regardless of his or her zone of attendance, if he
or she: (1) transfers to a school that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils
may enroll; or (2) transfers before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill
makes a conforming change to prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules,
policies, procedures or requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed
by the Association pursuant to section 7.
Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain
reasons and seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport
or interscholastic activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the
Association. Section 4 additionally: (1) prescribes certain requirements governing
the supporting documentation for such a request; and (2) requires the Association to
provide for procedures for reviewing such a request.
Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or
order made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a
decision to a hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the
Association. Existing law additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for
filing such an appeal. (NRS 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time
period within which such a hearing must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or
school to appeal a decision or order made by the hearing officer to the school
district within which the pupil is enrolled or the school is located and (3) authorizes
the Association to grant an appeal without appointing a hearing officer in certain
circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides that, in addition to a decision of the
Association or a designee of the Association that is authorized to make final
decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of a school district or
its designee on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be stayed by a court
pending final judgment on the matter.
Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and
regulations as necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill
before July 1, 2026.

section is ineligible to participate and practice in a sanctioned

Interscholastic Activities Association shall hold a hearing on the
complaint in accordance with procedures established by
regulation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association.
4. If, after conducting a hearing pursuant to subsection 3, the
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association determines that a

probation and any coach or member of his or her staff who was
involved in the athletic recruitment must be suspended for not less
than:

which the violation relates, if the suspension is imposed during the
season; and
(2) The entirety of the next full season of the sport to which

calendar years.
5. As used in this section:
(a) “Athletic recruitment” means any effort to persuade,
pressure, urge or entice a pupil to enroll in or transfer to a school
for athletic purposes, including, without limitation:
(1) Communicating through social media, mail, brochures
or other media directed towards the pupil that compares schools or
athletic programs or teams or describes the athletic assets of the
school with which the sender is affiliated; and
(2) Initiating or engaging in persuasive interviews or
communications with the pupil.
(b) “Social media” means any electronic service or account or
electronic content, including, without limitation, videos,

Internet website profiles.
Sec. 4. 1. A pupil who transfers from a school to another
school is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any
sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the
school to which the pupil transfers if the pupil, or a parent or legal
guardian of the pupil, submits to the Nevada Interscholastic
Activities Association a request for a waiver of any period of
ineligibility based on transferring schools, the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association approves the request
pursuant to this section and the pupil is otherwise eligible to
participate and practice in the sanctioned sport or other
interscholastic activity or event. If the Nevada Interscholastic
Activities Association does not take action on a request submitted
pursuant to this section within 30 days after the request is
submitted, the request shall be deemed approved.
2. The Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association shall
approve a request submitted pursuant to subsection 1 if the pupil,
or the parent or legal guardian of the pupil, establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the pupil transferred to the
school because:
(a) Of the order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction
that directly or indirectly results in the pupil transferring schools,
including, without limitation, any order issued pursuant to chapter
432B of NRS.
