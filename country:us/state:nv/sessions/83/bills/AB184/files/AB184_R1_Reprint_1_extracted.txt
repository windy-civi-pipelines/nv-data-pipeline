EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association from
retaliating against a school or person for certain activities;
prohibiting athletic recruitment; revising provisions
governing certain hearings and appeals conducted by the
Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility
of pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice
in a sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
event; revising requirements relating to the adoption of
regulations by the Association; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls,
2 supervises and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic
3 events in public schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and
4 participation of certain pupils in interscholastic activities and events. (NRS
5 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law requires the Association to adopt
6 rules and regulations in the same manner provided for state agencies by the Nevada
7 Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS, NRS 385B.060) Existing
8 regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and aligning the schools
9 within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part, require the Board of
10 Control of the Association to determine the classification and alignment of each
11 school by majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC 385B.250)
12 Section 4.5 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of any
-
*AB184_R1*
– 2 –
13 policy, practice, rule or regulation concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or
14 school districts be accomplished by rule or regulation in conformity with the
15 Nevada Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any change to the
16 classification or alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class,
17 region or league be accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the
18 Association from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who
19 advocates for or against a policy in certain circumstances.
20 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the
21 Association to investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a
22 complaint alleging a violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for
23 such a violation, including providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of
24 athletic recruitment is ineligible to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at
25 the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that
26 certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not apply to a pupil who
27 enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
28 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is
29 presumed ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the
30 pupil transfers for 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to
31 become immediately eligible to participate in certain circumstances. (NAC
32 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a pupil who is the child of a
33 military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate Compact on
34 Educational Opportunity for military children, which is an interstate compact that
35 establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families
36 between schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any
37 sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the
38 pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130, 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides that,
39 regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a pupil is immediately eligible to
40 participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
41 event at the school to which the pupil transfers if he or she: (1) transfers to a school
42 that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils may enroll; or (2) transfers
43 before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change to
44 prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures or
45 requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association
46 pursuant to section 7.
47 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain
48 reasons and seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport
49 or interscholastic activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the
50 Association. Section 4 additionally: (1) prescribes certain requirements governing
51 the supporting documentation for such a request; and (2) requires the Association to
52 provide for procedures for reviewing such a request.
53 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or
54 order made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a
55 decision to a hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the
56 Association. Existing law additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for
57 filing such an appeal. (NRS 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time
58 period within which such a hearing must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or
59 school to appeal a decision or order made by the hearing officer to the school
60 district within which the pupil is enrolled or the school is located and (3) authorizes
61 the Association to grant an appeal without appointing a hearing officer in certain
62 circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides that, in addition to a decision of the
63 Association or a designee of the Association that is authorized to make final
64 decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of a school district or
65 its designee on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be stayed by a court
66 pending final judgment on the matter.

67 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and
68 regulations as necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill
69 before July 1, 2026.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to interscholastic
activities. (BDR 34-186)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association from
retaliating against a school or person for certain activities;
prohibiting athletic recruitment; revising provisions
governing certain hearings and appeals conducted by the
Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility
of pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice
in a sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
event; revising requirements relating to the adoption of
regulations by the Association; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls,
2 supervises and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic
3 events in public schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and
4 participation of certain pupils in interscholastic activities and events. (NRS
5 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law requires the Association to adopt
6 rules and regulations in the same manner provided for state agencies by the Nevada
7 Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS, NRS 385B.060) Existing
8 regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and aligning the schools
9 within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part, require the Board of
10 Control of the Association to determine the classification and alignment of each
11 school by majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC 385B.250)
12 Section 4.5 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of any
-
*AB184_R1*

– 2 –
13 policy, practice, rule or regulation concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or
14 school districts be accomplished by rule or regulation in conformity with the
15 Nevada Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any change to the
16 classification or alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class,
17 region or league be accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the
18 Association from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who
19 advocates for or against a policy in certain circumstances.
20 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the
21 Association to investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a
22 complaint alleging a violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for
23 such a violation, including providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of
24 athletic recruitment is ineligible to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at
25 the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that
26 certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not apply to a pupil who
27 enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
28 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is
29 presumed ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the
30 pupil transfers for 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to
31 become immediately eligible to participate in certain circumstances. (NAC
32 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a pupil who is the child of a
33 military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate Compact on
34 Educational Opportunity for military children, which is an interstate compact that
35 establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families
36 between schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any
37 sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the
38 pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130, 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides that,
39 regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a pupil is immediately eligible to
40 participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
41 event at the school to which the pupil transfers if he or she: (1) transfers to a school
42 that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils may enroll; or (2) transfers
43 before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change to
44 prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures or
45 requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association
46 pursuant to section 7.
47 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain
48 reasons and seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport
49 or interscholastic activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the
50 Association. Section 4 additionally: (1) prescribes certain requirements governing
51 the supporting documentation for such a request; and (2) requires the Association to
52 provide for procedures for reviewing such a request.
53 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or
54 order made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a
55 decision to a hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the
56 Association. Existing law additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for
57 filing such an appeal. (NRS 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time
58 period within which such a hearing must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or
59 school to appeal a decision or order made by the hearing officer to the school
60 district within which the pupil is enrolled or the school is located and (3) authorizes
61 the Association to grant an appeal without appointing a hearing officer in certain
62 circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides that, in addition to a decision of the
63 Association or a designee of the Association that is authorized to make final
64 decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of a school district or
65 its designee on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be stayed by a court
66 pending final judgment on the matter.

67 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and
68 regulations as necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill
69 before July 1, 2026.

29 regulation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association.

26 sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the
27 school to which the pupil transfers if the pupil, or a parent or legal
28 guardian of the pupil, submits to the Nevada Interscholastic
29 Activities Association a request for a waiver of any period of
30 ineligibility based on transferring schools, the Nevada
31 Interscholastic Activities Association approves the request
32 pursuant to this section and the pupil is otherwise eligible to
33 participate and practice in the sanctioned sport or other
34 interscholastic activity or event. If the Nevada Interscholastic

36 pursuant to this section within 30 days after the request is
37 submitted, the request shall be deemed approved.
38 2. The Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association shall
39 approve a request submitted pursuant to subsection 1 if the pupil,
