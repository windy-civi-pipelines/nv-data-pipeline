EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the
Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association from
retaliating against a school or person for certain activities;
prohibiting athletic recruitment; revising provisions
governing certain hearings and appeals conducted by the
Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility
of pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice
in a sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
event; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls,
2 supervises and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic
3 events in public schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and
4 participation of certain pupils in interscholastic activities and events. (NRS
5 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Section 2 of this bill prohibits the Association
6 from taking certain adverse action against a school or person who advocates for or
7 against a policy in certain circumstances. Sections 7 and 9 of this bill prohibit the
8 Association and any school district or school from considering or authorizing the
9 consideration of the zone of attendance in which a pupil resides in determining
10 whether the pupil is eligible to participate in an interscholastic activity or event.
11 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the
12 Association to investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a
13 complaint alleging a violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for
14 such a violation, including providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of
15 athletic recruitment is ineligible to participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at
16 the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that
17 certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not apply to a pupil who
18 enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.

19 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is
20 presumed ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the
21 pupil transfers for 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to
22 become immediately eligible to participate in certain circumstances. (NAC
23 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a pupil who is the child of a
24 military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate Compact on
25 Educational Opportunity for military children, which is an interstate compact that
26 establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families
27 between schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any
28 sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the
29 pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130, 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides that,
30 regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a pupil is immediately eligible to
31 participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
32 event at the school to which the pupil transfers if he or she: (1) transfers to a school
33 that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils may enroll; or (2) transfers
34 before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change to
35 prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures or
36 requirements that are more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association
37 pursuant to section 7.
38 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain
39 reasons and seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport
40 or interscholastic activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the
41 Association. Section 4 additionally: (1) prescribes certain requirements governing
42 the supporting documentation for such a request; and (2) requires the Association to
43 provide for procedures for reviewing such a request.
44 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or
45 order made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a
46 decision to a hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the
47 Association. Existing law additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for
48 filing such an appeal. (NRS 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time
49 period within which such a hearing must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or
50 school to appeal a decision or order made by the hearing officer to the State Board
51 of Education; and (3) authorizes the Association to grant an appeal without
52 appointing a hearing officer in certain circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides
53 that, in addition to a decision of the Association or a designee of the Association
54 that is authorized to make final decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a
55 decision of the State Board on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must not be
56 stayed by a court pending final judgment on the matter.
57 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and
58 regulations as necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill
59 before June 30, 2026.
