AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association from retaliating against a school
or person for certain activities; prohibiting athletic recruitment;
revising provisions governing certain hearings and appeals conducted
by the Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility of
pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice in a sanctioned
sport or other interscholastic activity or event; revising requirements
relating to the adoption of regulations by the Association; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls, supervises
2 and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic events in public
3 schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and participation of certain pupils in
4 interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law
5 requires the Association to adopt rules and regulations in the same manner provided for
6 state agencies by the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS,
7 NRS 385B.060) Existing regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and
8 aligning the schools within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part,
9 require the Board of Control of the Association to determine the classification and
10 alignment of each school by majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC
11 385B.250) Section 4.5 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of
12 any policy, practice, rule or regulation concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or
13 school districts be accomplished by rule or regulation in conformity with the Nevada
14 Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any change to the classification or
15 alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class, region or league be
16 accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the Association from taking
17 certain adverse action against a school or person who advocates for or against a policy in
18 certain circumstances. [Sections 7 and 9 of this bill prohibit the Association and any school
19 district or school from considering or authorizing the consideration of the zone of attendance
Assembly Amendment No. 162 to Assembly Bill No. 184 Page 4
20 in which a pupil resides in determining whether the pupil is eligible to participate in an
21 interscholastic activity or event.]
22 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the Association to
23 investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a complaint alleging a
24 violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for such a violation, including
25 providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of athletic recruitment is ineligible to
26 participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make
27 conforming changes to clarify that certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not
28 apply to a pupil who enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
29 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is presumed
30 ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the pupil transfers for
31 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to become immediately eligible to
32 participate in certain circumstances. (NAC 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a
33 pupil who is the child of a military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate
34 Compact on Educational Opportunity for military children, which is an interstate compact that
35 establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families between
36 schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other
37 interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130,
38 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides that, regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a
39 pupil is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other
40 interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers if he or she: (1)
41 transfers to a school that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils may enroll; or (2)
42 transfers before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change to
43 prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures or requirements that are
44 more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association pursuant to section 7.
45 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain reasons and
46 seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport or interscholastic
47 activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the Association. Section 4 additionally:
48 (1) prescribes certain requirements governing the supporting documentation for such a
49 request; and (2) requires the Association to provide for procedures for reviewing such a
50 request.
51 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or order
52 made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a decision to a
53 hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the Association. Existing law
54 additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for filing such an appeal. (NRS
55 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time period within which such a hearing
56 must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or school to appeal a decision or order made by the
57 hearing officer to the [State Board of Education;] school district within which the pupil is
58 enrolled or the school is located and (3) authorizes the Association to grant an appeal
59 without appointing a hearing officer in certain circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides
60 that, in addition to a decision of the Association or a designee of the Association that is
61 authorized to make final decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of [the
62 State Board] a school district or its designee on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must
63 not be stayed by a court pending final judgment on the matter.
64 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and regulations as
65 necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill before [June 30,] July 1,
66 2026.

20 4. [For the purposes of subsection 3 and any hearing held pursuant thereto,

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; prohibiting the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association from retaliating against a school
or person for certain activities; prohibiting athletic recruitment;
revising provisions governing certain hearings and appeals conducted
by the Association; revising provisions governing the eligibility of
pupils who transfer schools to participate and practice in a sanctioned
sport or other interscholastic activity or event; revising requirements
relating to the adoption of regulations by the Association; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association controls, supervises
2 and regulates all interscholastic athletic events and other interscholastic events in public
3 schools and governs, among other matters, the eligibility and participation of certain pupils in
4 interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.050, 385B.060, 385B.130) Existing law
5 requires the Association to adopt rules and regulations in the same manner provided for
6 state agencies by the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233B of NRS,
7 NRS 385B.060) Existing regulations establish certain procedures for classifying and
8 aligning the schools within the Association into leagues or regions, which, in part,
9 require the Board of Control of the Association to determine the classification and
10 alignment of each school by majority vote after conducting a public hearing. (NAC
11 385B.250) Section 4.5 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the adoption, repeal or amendment of
12 any policy, practice, rule or regulation concerning or affecting pupils, public schools or
13 school districts be accomplished by rule or regulation in conformity with the Nevada
14 Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) requires any change to the classification or
15 alignment of a school or the creation of a new conference, class, region or league be
16 accomplished by regulation. Section 2 of this bill prohibits the Association from taking
17 certain adverse action against a school or person who advocates for or against a policy in
18 certain circumstances. [Sections 7 and 9 of this bill prohibit the Association and any school
19 district or school from considering or authorizing the consideration of the zone of attendance

Assembly Amendment No. 162 to Assembly Bill No. 184 Page 4
20 in which a pupil resides in determining whether the pupil is eligible to participate in an
21 interscholastic activity or event.]
22 Section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits athletic recruitment; (2) requires the Association to
23 investigate and, under certain circumstances, hold a hearing on a complaint alleging a
24 violation of that prohibition; and (3) sets forth the penalties for such a violation, including
25 providing that a pupil who enrolls in a school because of athletic recruitment is ineligible to
26 participate and practice in a sanctioned sport at the school. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make
27 conforming changes to clarify that certain automatic eligibility for a sanctioned sport does not
28 apply to a pupil who enrolled in or transferred to a school because of athletic recruitment.
29 Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to another school is presumed
30 ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the school to which the pupil transfers for
31 180 school days and a pupil may rebut that presumption to become immediately eligible to
32 participate in certain circumstances. (NAC 385B.716) However, existing law provides that a
33 pupil who is the child of a military family and transferred schools pursuant to the Interstate
34 Compact on Educational Opportunity for military children, which is an interstate compact that
35 establishes a framework to facilitate the transfer of children in military families between
36 schools, is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other
37 interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers. (NRS 385B.130,
38 388F.010) Section 7 additionally provides that, regardless of his or her zone of attendance, a
39 pupil is immediately eligible to participate and practice in any sanctioned sport or other
40 interscholastic activity or event at the school to which the pupil transfers if he or she: (1)
41 transfers to a school that uses a lottery system to determine which pupils may enroll; or (2)
42 transfers before enrolling in grade 10. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change to
43 prohibit schools from adopting regulations, rules, policies, procedures or requirements that are
44 more restrictive than those prescribed by the Association pursuant to section 7.
45 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a pupil who transfers schools for certain reasons and
46 seeks to be immediately eligible to participate in any sanctioned sport or interscholastic
47 activity or event to submit a request for a waiver to the Association. Section 4 additionally:
48 (1) prescribes certain requirements governing the supporting documentation for such a
49 request; and (2) requires the Association to provide for procedures for reviewing such a
50 request.
51 Existing law authorizes a pupil or school that is aggrieved by a final decision or order
52 made pursuant to a regulation adopted by the Association to appeal such a decision to a
53 hearing officer appointed by the Executive Director of the Association. Existing law
54 additionally sets forth certain procedural requirements for filing such an appeal. (NRS
55 385B.100) Section 6 of this bill: (1) sets forth the time period within which such a hearing
56 must be conducted; (2) authorizes a pupil or school to appeal a decision or order made by the
57 hearing officer to the [State Board of Education;] school district within which the pupil is
58 enrolled or the school is located and (3) authorizes the Association to grant an appeal
59 without appointing a hearing officer in certain circumstances. Section 5 of this bill provides
60 that, in addition to a decision of the Association or a designee of the Association that is
61 authorized to make final decisions on disputes on behalf of the Association, a decision of [the
62 State Board] a school district or its designee on an appeal filed pursuant to section 6 must
63 not be stayed by a court pending final judgment on the matter.
64 Section 10 of this bill requires the Association to amend its rules and regulations as
65 necessary to conform with the provisions of sections 1-9 of this bill before [June 30,] July 1,
66 2026.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

16 investigation, that the complaint is not meritless, the Nevada Interscholastic
17 Activities Association shall hold a hearing on the complaint in accordance with
18 procedures established by regulation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
19 Association.
20 4. [For the purposes of subsection 3 and any hearing held pursuant thereto,
21 any evidence that a pupil has moved to a residence owned, leased or provided by
22 or otherwise associated with a person or organization associated with a school is
23 prima facie evidence that the school has engaged in athletic recruitment.
24 5.] If, after conducting a hearing pursuant to subsection 3, the Nevada
25 Interscholastic Activities Association determines that a school has engaged in
26 athletic recruitment, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association shall
27 impose the following penalties:
28 (a) For the first violation, the school must be placed on probation and any
29 coach or member of his or her staff who was involved in the athletic recruitment
30 must be suspended for not less than 10 games;
31 (b) For the second violation, any coach or member of his or her staff who
32 was involved in the athletic recruitment must be suspended for not less than 1

34 (c) For the third violation, any coach or member of his or her staff who was
35 involved in the athletic recruitment must be dismissed from his or her position on

37 calendar years.
38 [6.] 5. As used in this section:

2 pupil, or a parent or legal guardian of the pupil, submits to the Nevada
3 Interscholastic Activities Association a request for a waiver of any period of
4 ineligibility based on transferring schools, the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
5 Association approves the request pursuant to this section and the pupil is
6 otherwise eligible to participate and practice in the sanctioned sport or other
7 interscholastic activity or event. If the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
8 Association does not take action on a request submitted pursuant to this section
9 within 30 days after the request is submitted, the request shall be deemed
10 approved.
11 2. The Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association shall approve a request
12 submitted pursuant to subsection 1 if the pupil, or the parent or legal guardian of
13 the pupil, establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the pupil
14 transferred to the school because:
15 (a) Of the order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction that directly or
16 indirectly results in the pupil transferring schools, including, without limitation,
17 any order issued pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS.
18 (b) The pupil was a victim of assault or bullying at the school in which he or
