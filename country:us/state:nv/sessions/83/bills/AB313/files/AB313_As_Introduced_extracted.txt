AN ACT relating to taxation; creating an exemption from the
governmental services taxes on a vehicle registered by a
person who is a volunteer firefighter; revising provisions
relating to certain exemptions from governmental services
taxes on vehicle registrations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the imposition of a governmental services tax for the
2 privilege of operating any vehicle upon the public highways of this State, which is
3 included in the fees to register a vehicle. (NRS 371.030, 371.040) Existing law
4 imposes the tax based on the valuation of a vehicle, which is generally determined
5 on the basis of 35 percent of the manufacturer’s suggested retail price in Nevada.
6 (NRS 371.050) Existing law provides for exemptions from the governmental
7 services tax to a surviving spouse, a person who is blind and a veteran, not to
8 exceed the determined valuations of $1,000, $3,000 and $2,000, respectively. (NRS
9 371.101, 371.102, 371.103) Section 1 of this bill creates such an exemption for a
10 person who is a volunteer firefighter, not to exceed a determined valuation of
11 $8,750. Section 1 further provides that: (1) the exemption cannot be claimed in
12 more than one county; (2) the claimant is required to file an affidavit with the
13 Department of Motor Vehicles in the county where the exemption is claimed
14 attesting that he or she is a resident of the county and a current volunteer firefighter;
15 (3) the claimant is required to provide certain verification that he or she is a
16 volunteer firefighter; (4) the exemption ends the fiscal year beginning after the
17 claimant ceases to be a volunteer firefighter; and (5) the exemption must be
18 adjusted each fiscal year based on the Consumer Price Index (All Items).
19 Existing law further provides that: (1) the governmental services tax
20 exemptions given to a surviving spouse, a person who is blind and a veteran are
21 required to be claimed annually at any time on or before the date the tax is due; and
22 (2) a claimant is required to immediately notify the Department when he or she no
23 longer qualifies for such an exemption or face a penalty. (NRS 371.105, 371.106)

24 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make these provisions applicable to a governmental
25 services tax exemption given to person who is a volunteer firefighter.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 371 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Vehicles registered by a person who is a volunteer
4 firefighter, not to exceed the amount of $8,750 determined
5 valuation, are exempt from taxation, but the exemption must not
6 be allowed to anyone but bona fide residents of this State, and
7 must be filed in but one county in this State on account of that
8 person.
9 2. The person claiming the exemption must file with the
10 Department in the county where the exemption is claimed an
11 affidavit declaring his or her residency, that he or she currently
12 serves as a volunteer firefighter and that the exemption has been
13 claimed in no other county in this State for that year. The affidavit
14 must be made before the county assessor or a notary public. After
15 the filing of the original affidavit, the county assessor shall, except
16 as otherwise provided in this subsection, mail a form for renewal
17 of the exemption to the person each year following a year in which
18 the exemption was allowed for that person. The form must be
19 designed to facilitate its return by mail by the person claiming the
20 exemption. If so requested by the person claiming the exemption,
21 the county assessor may provide the form to the person by
22 electronic means in lieu of by mail.
23 3. Upon first claiming the exemption, the claimant shall
24 furnish to the Department:
25 (a) An identification card which indicates that the claimant
26 currently serves as a volunteer firefighter; or
27 (b) A letter from the chief officer of a volunteer or
28 combination fire department certifying the claimant as a volunteer
29 firefighter.
30 4. A person is not entitled to the exemption provided by this
31 section in any fiscal year beginning after the person ceases to be a
32 volunteer firefighter.
33 5. Beginning with the Fiscal Year 2027-2028, the monetary
34 amount in subsection 1 must be adjusted for each fiscal year by
35 adding to each amount the product of the amount multiplied by
36 the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items)
37 from December 2025 to the December preceding the fiscal year for
38 which the adjustment is calculated.

1 6. As used in this section, “volunteer firefighter” means a
2 person who serves actively in an unpaid capacity in a volunteer or
3 combination fire department within this State as a firefighter for
4 the benefit or safety of the public.
5 Sec. 2. NRS 371.105 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 371.105 Claims pursuant to NRS 371.101, 371.102, 371.103 or
7 371.104 or section 1 of this act for tax exemption on the
8 governmental services tax and designations of any amount to be
9 credited to the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Southern
10 Nevada or the Gift Account for the Veterans Home in Northern
11 Nevada pursuant to NRS 371.1035 must be filed annually at any
12 time on or before the date when payment of the tax is due. All
13 exemptions provided for in this section must not be in an amount
14 which gives the taxpayer a total exemption greater than that to
15 which the taxpayer is entitled during any fiscal year.
16 Sec. 3. NRS 371.106 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 371.106 1. Whenever any vehicle ceases to be exempt from
18 taxation under NRS 371.101, 371.102, 371.103 or 371.104 or
19 section 1 of this act because the owner no longer meets the
20 requirements for the exemption provided in those sections, its owner
21 shall immediately notify the Department of the fact.
22 2. If a person fails to notify the Department as required by
23 subsection 1 and as a result of such failure is allowed a tax
24 exemption to which he or she is not entitled, there shall be added to
25 and collected with the tax otherwise due a penalty equal to double
26 the amount of the tax. If the person’s failure is fraudulent and results
27 in his or her receiving a tax exemption to which he or she is not
28 entitled, the person is also guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
