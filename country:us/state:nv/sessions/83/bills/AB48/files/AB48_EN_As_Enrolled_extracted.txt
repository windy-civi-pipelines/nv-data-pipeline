Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; requiring a school administrator or
his or her designee to conduct an initial screening and
assessment of a report of discrimination based on race,
bullying or cyber-bullying to determine whether to take
certain actions; authorizing the board of trustees of a school
district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of
discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to
another school if his or her parent or guardian requests such
an assignment; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) prohibits discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-
bullying on the premises of a school, at an activity sponsored by a school or on any
school bus; and (2) establishes various provisions governing the protocol for
addressing violations of such prohibitions. (NRS 388.135-388.137) Under existing
law, after such a violation is reported to an administrator or his or her designee, the
administrator or his or her designee is required to begin an investigation into the
reported violation. If the findings of such an investigation show that a violation
occurred, existing law requires the administrator or his or her designee to make
recommendations concerning disciplinary action or other measures to be imposed
against the pupil who was the perpetrator of the violation. Additionally, existing
law requires the board of trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a
victim of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school
in the district if his or her parent or guardian requests the assignment. (NRS

Section 2:
388.1351) Existing law additionally authorizes an administrator to recommend
disciplinary action against a person who submits a report of discrimination based
on race, bullying or cyber-bullying that the administrator determines is false and
made with malice, intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional or
knowing violation of the law. (NRS 388.137)
This bill requires the administrator or his or her designee upon receipt of a
report of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to, in accordance
with any procedures prescribed by the Department of Education for such purposes,
immediately screen and assess the report to determine whether based on the facts
included in the report such discrimination likely occurred. If the administrator or
designee determines that such discrimination has occurred, the administrator or
designee shall take the actions and begin the investigation required in existing law.
If the administrator or designee determines that the facts included in the report do
not suggest that such discrimination has likely occurred, the administrator or
designee shall, unless such a person determines that a report is false and submitted
in violation of the law, adhere to any policies prescribed by the Department for
handling such a report. This bill additionally: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of
a school district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of discrimination based on
race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school in the district at the request of his
or her parent or guardian; and (2) prohibits the victim and perpetrator from being
assigned to the same school if both pupils are assigned to a new school as a result
of the violation.
