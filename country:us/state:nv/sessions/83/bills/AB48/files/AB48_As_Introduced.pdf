EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the board of trustees of a
school district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of
discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying
to another school if his or her parent or guardian requests
such an assignment; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits discrimination based on race, bullying and cyber-
2 bullying on the premises of a school, at an activity sponsored by a school or on any
3 school bus; and (2) establishes various provisions governing the protocol for
4 addressing violations of such prohibitions. (NRS 388.135-388.137) Under existing
5 law, after such a violation is reported to an administrator or his or her designee, the
6 administrator or his or her designee is required to begin an investigation into the
7 reported violation. If the findings of such an investigation show that a violation
8 occurred, existing law requires the administrator or his or her designee to make
9 recommendations concerning disciplinary action or other measures to be imposed
10 against the pupil who was the perpetrator of the violation. Additionally, existing
11 law requires the board of trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a
12 victim of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school
13 in the district if his or her parent or guardian requests the assignment.
14 (NRS 388.1351)
15 This bill: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to assign a
16 pupil who is a perpetrator of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-
17 bullying to another school in the district at the request of his or her parent or
18 guardian; and (2) prohibits the victim and perpetrator from being assigned to the
19 same school if both pupils are assigned to a new school as a result of the violation.

6 that a violation of NRS 388.135 has occurred shall report the
7 violation to the administrator or his or her designee as soon as
8 practicable, but not later than a time during the same day on which

11 violation.
12 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, upon
13 receiving a report required by subsection 1, the administrator or

15 discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying and ensure
16 the safety and well-being of the reported victim or victims of the
17 discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying and shall
18 begin an investigation into the report. If the administrator or
19 designee does not have access to the reported victim of the alleged
20 violation of NRS 388.135, the administrator or designee may wait
21 until the next school day when he or she has such access to take the
22 action required by this subsection.

29 cyber-bullying, as applicable, either as a reported aggressor or a
30 reported victim of the discrimination based on race, bullying or
31 cyber-bullying. The notification must be provided:
