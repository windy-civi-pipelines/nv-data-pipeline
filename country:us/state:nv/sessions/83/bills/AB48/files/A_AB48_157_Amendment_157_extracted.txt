EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring a school administrator or his or her
designee to conduct an initial screening and assessment of a report
of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to
determine whether to take certain actions; authorizing the board of
trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of
discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another
school if his or her parent or guardian requests such an assignment; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits discrimination based on race, bullying [and] or cyber-bullying
2 on the premises of a school, at an activity sponsored by a school or on any school bus; and (2)
3 establishes various provisions governing the protocol for addressing violations of such
4 prohibitions. (NRS 388.135-388.137) Under existing law, after such a violation is reported to
5 an administrator or his or her designee, the administrator or his or her designee is required to
6 begin an investigation into the reported violation. If the findings of such an investigation show
7 that a violation occurred, existing law requires the administrator or his or her designee to
8 make recommendations concerning disciplinary action or other measures to be imposed
9 against the pupil who was the perpetrator of the violation. Additionally, existing law requires
10 the board of trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a victim of discrimination
11 based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school in the district if his or her parent or
12 guardian requests the assignment. (NRS 388.1351) Existing law additionally authorizes an
13 administrator to recommend disciplinary action against a person who submits a report
14 of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying that the administrator
15 determines is false and made with malice, intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or
16 intentional or knowing violation of the law. (NRS 388.137)
17 This bill requires the administrator or his or her designee upon receipt of a report of
18 discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to, in accordance with any
19 procedures prescribed by the Department of Education for such purposes, immediately
20 screen and assess the report to determine whether based on the facts included in the
21 report such discrimination likely occurred. If the administrator or designee determines
22 that such discrimination has occurred, the administrator or designee shall take the
23 actions and begin the investigation required in existing law. If the administrator or
24 designee determines that the facts included in the report do not suggest that such
Assembly Amendment No. 157 to Assembly Bill No. 48 Page 4
25 discrimination has likely occurred, the administrator or designee shall, unless such a
26 person determines that a report is false and submitted in violation of the law, adhere to
27 any policies prescribed by the Department for handling such a report. This bill [:]
28 additionally: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a
29 perpetrator of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school in the
30 district at the request of his or her parent or guardian; and (2) prohibits the victim and
31 perpetrator from being assigned to the same school if both pupils are assigned to a new school
32 as a result of the violation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

5 report the violation to the administrator or his or her designee as soon as
6 practicable, but not later than a time during the same day on which the teacher,

8 information regarding the occurrence of a violation.
9 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, upon receiving a report
10 required by subsection 1, the administrator or designee shall immediately , in
11 accordance with any relevant procedures prescribed by the Department for such
12 purposes, screen and assess the report to determine whether the facts included in
13 the report suggest that a violation of NRS 388.135 has likely occurred. If the
14 administrator or designee determines that:
15 (a) A violation of NRS 388.135 has likely occurred, the administrator or
16 designee shall take any necessary action to stop the discrimination based on race,
17 bullying or cyber-bullying and ensure the safety and well-being of the reported

19 and shall begin an investigation into the report. If the administrator or designee
20 does not have access to the reported victim of the alleged violation of NRS
21 388.135, the administrator or designee may wait until the next school day when he
22 or she has such access to take the action required by this subsection.
23 (b) The facts included in the report do not suggest that a violation of NRS
24 388.135 has likely occurred, the administrator or designee shall adhere to any

9 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an investigation required
10 by this section must be completed, to the greatest extent practicable, within 5
11 school days after the administrator or designee receives a report required by

27 paragraph (a) of subsection 3 as part of the investigation; and
28 (b) Any action taken after the completion of the investigation to address the

37 8. Not later than 10 school days after receiving a report required by

AN ACT relating to education; requiring a school administrator or his or her
designee to conduct an initial screening and assessment of a report
of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to
determine whether to take certain actions; authorizing the board of
trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of

school if his or her parent or guardian requests such an assignment; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits discrimination based on race, bullying [and] or cyber-bullying
2 on the premises of a school, at an activity sponsored by a school or on any school bus; and (2)
3 establishes various provisions governing the protocol for addressing violations of such

6 begin an investigation into the reported violation. If the findings of such an investigation show
7 that a violation occurred, existing law requires the administrator or his or her designee to
8 make recommendations concerning disciplinary action or other measures to be imposed
9 against the pupil who was the perpetrator of the violation. Additionally, existing law requires

19 procedures prescribed by the Department of Education for such purposes, immediately
20 screen and assess the report to determine whether based on the facts included in the
21 report such discrimination likely occurred. If the administrator or designee determines
22 that such discrimination has occurred, the administrator or designee shall take the
23 actions and begin the investigation required in existing law. If the administrator or
24 designee determines that the facts included in the report do not suggest that such

25 discrimination has likely occurred, the administrator or designee shall, unless such a
26 person determines that a report is false and submitted in violation of the law, adhere to
27 any policies prescribed by the Department for handling such a report. This bill [:]
28 additionally: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a
29 perpetrator of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school in the
30 district at the request of his or her parent or guardian; and (2) prohibits the victim and
