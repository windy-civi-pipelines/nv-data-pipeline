EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring a school administrator or
his or her designee to conduct an initial screening and
assessment of a report of discrimination based on race,
bullying or cyber-bullying to determine whether to take
certain actions; authorizing the board of trustees of a
school district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of
discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying
to another school if his or her parent or guardian requests
such an assignment; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-
2 bullying on the premises of a school, at an activity sponsored by a school or on any
3 school bus; and (2) establishes various provisions governing the protocol for
4 addressing violations of such prohibitions. (NRS 388.135-388.137) Under existing
5 law, after such a violation is reported to an administrator or his or her designee, the
6 administrator or his or her designee is required to begin an investigation into the
7 reported violation. If the findings of such an investigation show that a violation
8 occurred, existing law requires the administrator or his or her designee to make
9 recommendations concerning disciplinary action or other measures to be imposed
10 against the pupil who was the perpetrator of the violation. Additionally, existing
11 law requires the board of trustees of a school district to assign a pupil who is a
12 victim of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school
13 in the district if his or her parent or guardian requests the assignment. (NRS
14 388.1351) Existing law additionally authorizes an administrator to recommend
15 disciplinary action against a person who submits a report of discrimination based
16 on race, bullying or cyber-bullying that the administrator determines is false and

– 2 –
17 made with malice, intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional or
18 knowing violation of the law. (NRS 388.137)
19 This bill requires the administrator or his or her designee upon receipt of a
20 report of discrimination based on race, bullying or cyber-bullying to, in accordance
21 with any procedures prescribed by the Department of Education for such purposes,
22 immediately screen and assess the report to determine whether based on the facts
23 included in the report such discrimination likely occurred. If the administrator or
24 designee determines that such discrimination has occurred, the administrator or
25 designee shall take the actions and begin the investigation required in existing law.
26 If the administrator or designee determines that the facts included in the report do
27 not suggest that such discrimination has likely occurred, the administrator or
28 designee shall, unless such a person determines that a report is false and submitted
29 in violation of the law, adhere to any policies prescribed by the Department for
30 handling such a report. This bill additionally: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of
31 a school district to assign a pupil who is a perpetrator of discrimination based on
32 race, bullying or cyber-bullying to another school in the district at the request of his
33 or her parent or guardian; and (2) prohibits the victim and perpetrator from being
34 assigned to the same school if both pupils are assigned to a new school as a result
35 of the violation.
