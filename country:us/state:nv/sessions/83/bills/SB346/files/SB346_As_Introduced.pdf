AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating
to guardianship; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Supported Decision-Making Act, which authorizes
2 an adult with a disability to enter into a supported decision-making agreement at
3 any time if the adult enters into the agreement voluntarily and understands the
4 nature and effect of the agreement. (Chapter 162C of NRS) Section 1 of this bill
5 defines the term “supported decision-making agreement” for the purposes of the
6 provisions of law governing guardianship of adults.
7 Existing law defines the term “incapacitated” for the purposes of the provisions
8 of law governing guardianships of adults. (NRS 159.019) Section 3 of this bill
9 expands the definition to include a person who is unable to understand the nature
10 and effect of a supported decision-making agreement.
11 Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental
12 agency, a nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the
13 appointment of a guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain
14 information; and (3) requires that the petitioner provide the court with an
15 assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person, which must be completed
16 by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill requires a petition for
17 the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information on
18 supported decision-making agreements has been provided to the proposed protected
19 person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed physician completing such an
20 assessment include a determination of whether the proposed protected person is
21 unable to understand the nature and effect of a supported decision-making
22 agreement. Section 4 provides that if the licensed physician determines that a
23 proposed protected person is able to understand the nature and effect of a supported
24 decision-making agreement, the petitioner is required to prove to the satisfaction of
-

– 2 –
25 the court that a supported decision-making agreement is not a reasonable alternative
26 to the guardianship.
27 Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report
28 containing certain information, file the report with the court and serve the report on
29 the protected person and any attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081)
30 Section 5 of this bill requires that such a report include: (1) a description of certain
31 skills and abilities of the protected person; and (2) an explanation as to why a
32 supported decision-making agreement is not a reasonable alternative to the
33 guardianship.
34 Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to
35 petition the court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing
36 law provides that for such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the
37 termination or modification of the guardianship is in the best interests of the
38 protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of this bill provides that such a
39 petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the protected person has
40 entered into a supported decision-making agreement in lieu of the guardianship.
41 Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth
42 certain specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7
43 of this bill provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about
44 alternatives to a guardianship, including, without limitation, a supported decision-
45 making agreement.
