EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating to guardianship;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the procedures and requirements relating to the appointment of a
2 guardian for a proposed protected person who is an adult. (Chapter 159 of NRS) Section 1.3
3 of this bill defines the term “less restrictive alternatives to guardianship” and section 1.7 of
4 this bill defines the term “power of attorney” for the purposes of the provisions of law
5 governing guardianship of adults.
6 Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental agency, a
7 nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the appointment of a
8 guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain information; and (3) requires that the
9 petitioner provide the court with an assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person,
10 which must be completed by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill
11 requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information
12 on less restrictive alternatives to guardianship has been provided to the proposed protected
13 person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed physician completing such an assessment
14 include a determination of whether less restrictive alternatives to guardianship are available
15 and sufficient to support the needs of the proposed protected person.
16 Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report containing certain
17 information, file the report with the court and serve the report on the protected person and any
18 attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081) Section 5 of this bill requires that such a
19 report include an explanation as to why less restrictive alternatives to guardianship in lieu of
20 the guardianship are not being considered.
21 Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to petition the
22 court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing law provides that for
23 such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the termination or modification of
24 the guardianship is in the best interests of the protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of
25 this bill provides that such a petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the
26 protected person has entered into a less restrictive alternative to a guardianship in lieu of the
27 guardianship.
28 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain procedures for a court to transfer a guardianship or
29 conservatorship order from another state to this State; (2) requires that a petition to transfer

Assembly Amendment No. 654 to Senate Bill No. 346 First Reprint Page 4
30 include certain information; (3) with certain exceptions, requires a court to issue a provisional
31 order and final order granting a petition to transfer in certain circumstances; and (4) requires a
32 court to recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from another state in certain
33 circumstances. (NRS 159.2024) Section 6.5 of this bill requires that a petition to transfer must
34 also include: (1) proof that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship were considered; and
35 (2) an explanation as to why less restrictive alternatives to guardianship are not reasonable
36 alternatives to guardianship. Section 6.5 provides that a court may deny a petition to transfer
37 if the court has previously denied a petition to transfer the guardianship or conservatorship
38 because less restrictive alternatives to guardianship for the protected person were not
39 considered, either in this State or in the state from which the petition seeks to transfer the
40 order. Section 6.5 also provides that if a court finds that less restrictive alternatives to
41 guardianship have not been considered for the protected person either in this State or in the
42 state from which the petition seeks to transfer the order, the court: (1) is not required to
43 recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state; and (2) may deny a
44 petition to transfer.
45 Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth certain
46 specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7 of this bill
47 provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about less restrictive alternatives
48 to guardianship.
