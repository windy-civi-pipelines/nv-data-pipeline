AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating to guardianship;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law establishes the Supported Decision-Making Act, which authorizes an adult
2 with a disability to enter into a supported decision-making agreement at any time if the adult
3 enters into the agreement voluntarily and understands the nature and effect of the agreement.
4 (Chapter 162C of NRS) Section 1 of this bill defines the term “supported decision-making
5 agreement” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of adults.
6 Existing law defines the term “incapacitated” for the purposes of the provisions of law
7 governing guardianships of adults. (NRS 159.019) Section 3 of this bill expands the definition
8 to include a person who is unable to understand the nature and effect of a supported decision-
9 making agreement.] Existing law sets forth the procedures and requirements relating to
10 the appointment of a guardian for a proposed protected person who is an adult.
11 (Chapter 159 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “less restrictive
12 alternatives to guardianship” and section 1.7 of this bill defines the term “power of
13 attorney” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of adults.
14 Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental agency, a
15 nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the appointment of a
16 guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain information; and (3) requires that the
17 petitioner provide the court with an assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person,
18 which must be completed by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill
19 requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information
20 on [supported decision-making agreements] less restrictive alternatives to guardianship has
21 been provided to the proposed protected person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed
22 physician completing such an assessment include a determination of whether less restrictive
23 alternatives to guardianship are available and sufficient to support the needs of the
24 proposed protected person . [is unable to understand the nature and effect of a supported
25 decision-making agreement. Section 4 provides that if the licensed physician determines that a
26 proposed protected person is able to understand the nature and effect of a supported decision-
27 making agreement, the petitioner is required to prove to the satisfaction of the court that a
28 supported decision-making agreement is not a reasonable alternative to the guardianship.]
29 Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report containing certain
30 information, file the report with the court and serve the report on the protected person and any
31 attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081) Section 5 of this bill requires that such a
32 report include [: (1) a description of certain skills and abilities of the protected person; and
Senate Amendment No. 144 to Senate Bill No. 346 Page 4
33 (2)] an explanation as to why [a supported decision-making agreement is not a reasonable
34 alternative to] less restrictive alternatives to guardianship in lieu of the guardianship [.] are
35 not being considered.
36 Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to petition the
37 court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing law provides that for
38 such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the termination or modification of
39 the guardianship is in the best interests of the protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of
40 this bill provides that such a petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the
41 protected person has entered into a [supported decision-making agreement] less restrictive
42 alternative to a guardianship in lieu of the guardianship.
43 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain procedures for a court to transfer a guardianship
44 or conservatorship order from another state to this State; (2) requires that a petition to
45 transfer include certain information; (3) with certain exceptions, requires a court to
46 issue a provisional order and final order granting a petition to transfer in certain
47 circumstances; and (4) requires a court to recognize a guardianship or conservatorship
48 order from another state in certain circumstances. (NRS 159.2024) Section 6.5 of this bill
49 requires that a petition to transfer must also include: (1) proof that less restrictive
50 alternatives to guardianship were considered; and (2) an explanation as to why less
51 restrictive alternatives to guardianship are not reasonable alternatives to guardianship.
52 Section 6.5 provides that a court may deny a petition to transfer if the court has
53 previously denied a petition to transfer the guardianship or conservatorship because less
54 restrictive alternatives to guardianship for the protected person were not considered,
55 either in this State or in the state from which the petition seeks to transfer the order.
56 Section 6.5 also provides that if a court finds that less restrictive alternatives to
57 guardianship have not been considered for the protected person either in this State or in
58 the state from which the petition seeks to transfer the order, the court: (1) is not
59 required to recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state; and
60 (2) may deny a petition to transfer.
61 Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth certain
62 specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7 of this bill
63 provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about [alternatives to a
64 guardianship, including, without limitation, a supported decision-making agreement.] less
65 restrictive alternatives to guardianship.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating to guardianship;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law establishes the Supported Decision-Making Act, which authorizes an adult
2 with a disability to enter into a supported decision-making agreement at any time if the adult
3 enters into the agreement voluntarily and understands the nature and effect of the agreement.
4 (Chapter 162C of NRS) Section 1 of this bill defines the term “supported decision-making
5 agreement” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of adults.
6 Existing law defines the term “incapacitated” for the purposes of the provisions of law
7 governing guardianships of adults. (NRS 159.019) Section 3 of this bill expands the definition
8 to include a person who is unable to understand the nature and effect of a supported decision-
9 making agreement.] Existing law sets forth the procedures and requirements relating to
10 the appointment of a guardian for a proposed protected person who is an adult.
11 (Chapter 159 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “less restrictive
12 alternatives to guardianship” and section 1.7 of this bill defines the term “power of
13 attorney” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of adults.
14 Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental agency, a
15 nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the appointment of a
16 guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain information; and (3) requires that the
17 petitioner provide the court with an assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person,
18 which must be completed by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill
19 requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information
20 on [supported decision-making agreements] less restrictive alternatives to guardianship has
21 been provided to the proposed protected person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed
22 physician completing such an assessment include a determination of whether less restrictive
23 alternatives to guardianship are available and sufficient to support the needs of the
24 proposed protected person . [is unable to understand the nature and effect of a supported
25 decision-making agreement. Section 4 provides that if the licensed physician determines that a
26 proposed protected person is able to understand the nature and effect of a supported decision-
27 making agreement, the petitioner is required to prove to the satisfaction of the court that a
28 supported decision-making agreement is not a reasonable alternative to the guardianship.]
29 Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report containing certain
30 information, file the report with the court and serve the report on the protected person and any
31 attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081) Section 5 of this bill requires that such a
32 report include [: (1) a description of certain skills and abilities of the protected person; and

Senate Amendment No. 144 to Senate Bill No. 346 Page 4
33 (2)] an explanation as to why [a supported decision-making agreement is not a reasonable
34 alternative to] less restrictive alternatives to guardianship in lieu of the guardianship [.] are
35 not being considered.
36 Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to petition the
37 court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing law provides that for
38 such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the termination or modification of
39 the guardianship is in the best interests of the protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of
40 this bill provides that such a petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the
41 protected person has entered into a [supported decision-making agreement] less restrictive
42 alternative to a guardianship in lieu of the guardianship.
43 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain procedures for a court to transfer a guardianship
44 or conservatorship order from another state to this State; (2) requires that a petition to
45 transfer include certain information; (3) with certain exceptions, requires a court to
46 issue a provisional order and final order granting a petition to transfer in certain
47 circumstances; and (4) requires a court to recognize a guardianship or conservatorship
48 order from another state in certain circumstances. (NRS 159.2024) Section 6.5 of this bill
49 requires that a petition to transfer must also include: (1) proof that less restrictive
50 alternatives to guardianship were considered; and (2) an explanation as to why less
51 restrictive alternatives to guardianship are not reasonable alternatives to guardianship.
52 Section 6.5 provides that a court may deny a petition to transfer if the court has
53 previously denied a petition to transfer the guardianship or conservatorship because less
54 restrictive alternatives to guardianship for the protected person were not considered,
55 either in this State or in the state from which the petition seeks to transfer the order.
56 Section 6.5 also provides that if a court finds that less restrictive alternatives to
57 guardianship have not been considered for the protected person either in this State or in
58 the state from which the petition seeks to transfer the order, the court: (1) is not
59 required to recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state; and
60 (2) may deny a petition to transfer.
61 Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth certain
62 specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7 of this bill
63 provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about [alternatives to a
64 guardianship, including, without limitation, a supported decision-making agreement.] less
65 restrictive alternatives to guardianship.

26 transferring the proceedings to this State.
27 4. Not later than 90 days after the issuance of a final order accepting transfer

36 6. The court may deny a petition under this section if the court determines
37 that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship were not considered either in this
38 State or in the other state. If a petition under this section is denied pursuant to

40 pursuant to NRS 159.044.
