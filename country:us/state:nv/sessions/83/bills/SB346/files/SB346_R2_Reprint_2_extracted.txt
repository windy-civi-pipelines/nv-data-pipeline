AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating
to guardianship; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the procedures and requirements relating to the
2 appointment of a guardian for a proposed protected person who is an adult.
3 (Chapter 159 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “less restrictive
4 alternatives to guardianship” and section 1.7 of this bill defines the term “power of
5 attorney” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of
6 adults.
7 Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental
8 agency, a nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the
9 appointment of a guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain
10 information; and (3) requires that the petitioner provide the court with an
11 assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person, which must be completed
12 by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill requires a petition for
13 the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information on less
14 restrictive alternatives to guardianship has been provided to the proposed protected
15 person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed physician completing such an
16 assessment include a determination of whether less restrictive alternatives to
17 guardianship are available and sufficient to support the needs of the proposed
18 protected person.
19 Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report
20 containing certain information, file the report with the court and serve the report on
-
*SB346_R2*
– 2 –
21 the protected person and any attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081)
22 Section 5 of this bill requires that such a report include an explanation as to why
23 less restrictive alternatives to guardianship in lieu of the guardianship are not being
24 considered.
25 Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to
26 petition the court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing
27 law provides that for such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the
28 termination or modification of the guardianship is in the best interests of the
29 protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of this bill provides that such a
30 petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the protected person has
31 entered into a less restrictive alternative to a guardianship in lieu of the
32 guardianship.
33 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain procedures for a court to transfer a
34 guardianship or conservatorship order from another state to this State; (2) requires
35 that a petition to transfer include certain information; (3) with certain exceptions,
36 requires a court to issue a provisional order and final order granting a petition to
37 transfer in certain circumstances; and (4) requires a court to recognize a
38 guardianship or conservatorship order from another state in certain circumstances.
39 (NRS 159.2024) Section 6.5 of this bill requires that a petition to transfer must also
40 include: (1) proof that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship were considered;
41 and (2) an explanation as to why less restrictive alternatives to guardianship are not
42 reasonable alternatives to guardianship. Section 6.5 provides that a court may deny
43 a petition to transfer if the court has previously denied a petition to transfer the
44 guardianship or conservatorship because less restrictive alternatives to guardianship
45 for the protected person were not considered, either in this State or in the state from
46 which the petition seeks to transfer the order. Section 6.5 also provides that if a
47 court finds that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship have not been
48 considered for the protected person either in this State or in the state from which the
49 petition seeks to transfer the order, the court: (1) is not required to recognize a
50 guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state; and (2) may deny a
51 petition to transfer.
52 Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth
53 certain specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7
54 of this bill provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about less
55 restrictive alternatives to guardianship.

39 6. The court may deny a petition under this section if the
40 court determines that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship
41 were not considered either in this State or in the other state. If a

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating
to guardianship; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the procedures and requirements relating to the
2 appointment of a guardian for a proposed protected person who is an adult.
3 (Chapter 159 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “less restrictive
4 alternatives to guardianship” and section 1.7 of this bill defines the term “power of
5 attorney” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of
6 adults.
7 Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental
8 agency, a nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the
9 appointment of a guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain
10 information; and (3) requires that the petitioner provide the court with an
11 assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person, which must be completed
12 by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill requires a petition for
13 the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information on less
14 restrictive alternatives to guardianship has been provided to the proposed protected
15 person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed physician completing such an
16 assessment include a determination of whether less restrictive alternatives to
17 guardianship are available and sufficient to support the needs of the proposed
18 protected person.
19 Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report
20 containing certain information, file the report with the court and serve the report on
-
*SB346_R2*

– 2 –
21 the protected person and any attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081)
22 Section 5 of this bill requires that such a report include an explanation as to why
23 less restrictive alternatives to guardianship in lieu of the guardianship are not being
24 considered.
25 Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to
26 petition the court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing
27 law provides that for such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the
28 termination or modification of the guardianship is in the best interests of the
29 protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of this bill provides that such a
30 petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the protected person has
31 entered into a less restrictive alternative to a guardianship in lieu of the
32 guardianship.
33 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain procedures for a court to transfer a
34 guardianship or conservatorship order from another state to this State; (2) requires
35 that a petition to transfer include certain information; (3) with certain exceptions,
36 requires a court to issue a provisional order and final order granting a petition to
37 transfer in certain circumstances; and (4) requires a court to recognize a
38 guardianship or conservatorship order from another state in certain circumstances.
39 (NRS 159.2024) Section 6.5 of this bill requires that a petition to transfer must also
40 include: (1) proof that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship were considered;
41 and (2) an explanation as to why less restrictive alternatives to guardianship are not
42 reasonable alternatives to guardianship. Section 6.5 provides that a court may deny
43 a petition to transfer if the court has previously denied a petition to transfer the
44 guardianship or conservatorship because less restrictive alternatives to guardianship
45 for the protected person were not considered, either in this State or in the state from
46 which the petition seeks to transfer the order. Section 6.5 also provides that if a
47 court finds that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship have not been
48 considered for the protected person either in this State or in the state from which the
49 petition seeks to transfer the order, the court: (1) is not required to recognize a
50 guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state; and (2) may deny a
51 petition to transfer.
52 Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth
53 certain specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7
54 of this bill provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about less
55 restrictive alternatives to guardianship.

1 Sec. 6.5. NRS 159.2024 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 159.2024 1. To transfer jurisdiction of a guardianship or
3 conservatorship to this State, the guardian, conservator or other
4 interested party must petition the court of this State for guardianship
5 pursuant to NRS 159.1991 to 159.2029, inclusive, to accept
6 guardianship in this State. The petition must include [a] :
7 (a) A certified copy of the other state’s provisional order of

29 accepting transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship, the court

37 less restrictive alternatives to guardianship for the protected
38 person were not considered, either in this State or the other state.
39 6. The court may deny a petition under this section if the
40 court determines that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship
41 were not considered either in this State or in the other state. If a
42 petition under this section is denied pursuant to this subsection,
43 such denial does not preclude the petitioner from filing a petition
44 pursuant to NRS 159.044.
