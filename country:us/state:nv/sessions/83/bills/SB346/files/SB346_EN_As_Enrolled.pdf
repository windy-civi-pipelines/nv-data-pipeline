Stone
Joint Sponsor: Assemblymember Hansen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to guardianship; making various changes relating
to guardianship; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth the procedures and requirements relating to the
appointment of a guardian for a proposed protected person who is an adult.
(Chapter 159 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “less restrictive
alternatives to guardianship” and section 1.7 of this bill defines the term “power of
attorney” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianship of
adults.
Existing law: (1) authorizes a proposed protected person, a governmental
agency, a nonprofit organization or an interested person to petition the court for the
appointment of a guardian; (2) requires such a petition to include certain
information; and (3) requires that the petitioner provide the court with an
assessment of the needs of the proposed protected person, which must be completed
by a licensed physician. (NRS 159.044) Section 4 of this bill requires a petition for
the appointment of a guardian to contain an attestation that information on less
restrictive alternatives to guardianship has been provided to the proposed protected
person. Section 4 also requires that a licensed physician completing such an
assessment include a determination of whether less restrictive alternatives to
guardianship are available and sufficient to support the needs of the proposed
protected person.
Existing law requires a guardian of the person to make a written report
containing certain information, file the report with the court and serve the report on
the protected person and any attorney for the protected person. (NRS 159.081)
Section 5 of this bill requires that such a report include an explanation as to why
less restrictive alternatives to guardianship in lieu of the guardianship are not being
considered.
Existing law authorizes a protected person, the guardian or another person to
petition the court for the termination or modification of a guardianship. Existing
law provides that for such a petition to be granted, the petitioner must prove that the
termination or modification of the guardianship is in the best interests of the
protected person. (NRS 159.1905) Section 6 of this bill provides that such a
petition may also be granted if the petitioner shows that the protected person has
entered into a less restrictive alternative to a guardianship in lieu of the
guardianship.
Existing law: (1) sets forth certain procedures for a court to transfer a
guardianship or conservatorship order from another state to this State; (2) requires
that a petition to transfer include certain information; (3) with certain exceptions,
requires a court to issue a provisional order and final order granting a petition to
transfer in certain circumstances; and (4) requires a court to recognize a
guardianship or conservatorship order from another state in certain circumstances.
(NRS 159.2024) Section 6.5 of this bill requires that a petition to transfer must also
include: (1) proof that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship were considered;
-

– 2 –
and (2) an explanation as to why less restrictive alternatives to guardianship are not
reasonable alternatives to guardianship. Section 6.5 provides that a court may deny
a petition to transfer if the court has previously denied a petition to transfer the
guardianship or conservatorship because less restrictive alternatives to guardianship
for the protected person were not considered, either in this State or in the state from
which the petition seeks to transfer the order. Section 6.5 also provides that if a
court finds that less restrictive alternatives to guardianship have not been
considered for the protected person either in this State or in the state from which the
petition seeks to transfer the order, the court: (1) is not required to recognize a
guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state; and (2) may deny a
petition to transfer.
Existing law establishes the Protected Persons’ Bill of Rights, which sets forth
certain specific rights of each protected person. (NRS 159.327, 159.328) Section 7
of this bill provides that a protected person has the right to be educated about less
restrictive alternatives to guardianship.
