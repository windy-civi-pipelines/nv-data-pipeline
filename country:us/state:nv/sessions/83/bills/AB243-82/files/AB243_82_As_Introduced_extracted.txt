Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
2 or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
3 business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
4 for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
5 committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
6 contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
7 applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)

8 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
9 committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
10 require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
11 management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
12 and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
13 of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
14 particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
15 unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
16 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
17 position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
18 to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
19 Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
20 Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
21 Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
22 in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
23 principles of parliamentary law, sections 4-6 of this bill codify those existing
24 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
25 committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
26 enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
27 State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
28 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
29 Legislature that may evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction of
30 the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
31 Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
32 conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
33 provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
34 Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
35 select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
36 218E.320, 218E.330)
37 Sections 8-10 of this bill clarify and revise various requirements governing the
38 Joint Interim Standing Committees. Section 8 of this bill renames the Joint Interim
39 Standing Committee on Natural Resources as the Joint Interim Standing Committee
40 on Natural Resources and Public Lands. Sections 1, 15-17, 43 and 47.5 of this bill
41 make conforming changes. Section 8 additionally requires the appointing
42 authorities to appoint the committee members for each Joint Interim Standing
43 Committee, along with the Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than August 31
44 following the adjournment of each regular session. Section 8 also clarifies the
45 length of the terms that the committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs
46 serve while qualified.
47 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Joint Interim Standing Committees to begin
48 holding their meetings on September 1 after the adjournment of each regular
49 session, instead of November 1 under existing law. Section 9 provides that if a
50 regular member cannot attend a meeting of the Committee, an alternate member
51 must be of the same political party as the regular member, and section 9 clarifies
52 that, when acting in place of a regular member, an alternate member has all the
53 powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
54 Existing law requires that any recommended legislation proposed by a Joint
55 Interim Standing Committee must be approved by a majority of the members of the
56 Senate and a majority of the members of the Assembly serving on the Committee.
57 (NRS 218E.325) Section 9 changes this requirement by providing that any
58 recommended legislation proposed by a Committee must be approved by a vote in
59 favor of such legislation by at least five members of the eight-member Committee,
60 regardless of their House.
61 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
62 Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental
-

63 purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 10 of this bill transfers such duties to the
64 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 44 of this bill
65 makes a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations
66 for legislation relating to government purchasing be submitted to the Joint Interim
67 Standing Committee on Government Affairs.
68 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
69 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
70 powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 15-17, 43
71 and 51 of this bill eliminate the Subcommittee and transfer its powers and duties to
72 the renamed Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Public
73 Lands. Section 16 of this bill requires the renamed Joint Interim Standing
74 Committee on Natural Resources and Public Lands to hold at least three meetings
75 during each legislative interim where the primary physical location of the meeting
76 is located in a different county for each such meeting other than Clark County,
77 Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 16 does not prohibit the use of
78 authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting, including when
79 necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to additional
80 physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
81 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
82 Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
83 System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
84 With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 18
85 and 19 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of each
86 Legislative Committee.
87 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
88 (NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 33-40 of this bill: (1) rename the Sunset
89 Subcommittee as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature; and (2) revise the
90 membership, organization and operations of the Sunset Committee.
91 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
92 committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
93 each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 of this bill revises the number of
94 such requests that may be made by the Sunset Committee of the Legislature.
95 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
96 Human Services to review certain regulations that are proposed or adopted by
97 certain licensing boards and that are related to health care. (NRS 439B.225)
98 Section 51 of this bill repeals the requirement that the Joint Interim Standing
99 Committee on Health and Human Services review such regulations. Sections 41
100 and 42 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate the requirement that such
101 regulations be submitted to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
102 Human Services.
103 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
104 Teacher Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force to submit an application
105 to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before January 15 of
106 an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494) Section 46 of this bill moves the due date
107 of the application from January 15 of an even-numbered year to December 1 of an
108 odd-numbered year.
109 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
110 compiled by state or local governmental agencies and then reported to certain
111 legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461, 209.4818,
112 332.215, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 29-32, 44, 45 and 47 of this bill revise those
113 reporting requirements.
114 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
115 (Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
116 and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
117 any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
-
*AB243_R2*
– 4 –
118 session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
119 gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
120 value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
121 meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
122 “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
123 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
124 statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
125 (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
126 Sections 20-27 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
127 investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 22 of this bill defines a “legislative
128 committee investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or
129 trips that the chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events
130 or trips of the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative
131 staff members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
132 matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
133 legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 24 and 26 of this bill, such
134 legislative committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be
135 reported on financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act.
136 (NRS 281.5583, 281.5585)
137 Sections 24 and 26 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
138 informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
139 the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
140 staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
141 administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
142 meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
143 legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
144 Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
145 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
146 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
147 statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
148 of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
149 informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
150 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
151 statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
152 public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
153 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

5 Sec. 15. NRS 218E.500 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 218E.500 The Legislature finds and declares that:
7 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
8 sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
9 continuing concern to this State.
10 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
11 federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
12 management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
13 within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
14 as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
15 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
16 has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
17 subjected to regulations which sometimes are unreasonable,
18 arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or the scope of the
19 authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
20 regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment,
21 and judicially tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and
22 interests of the State and its citizens.
23 4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large
24 proportion of the total area have shown an interest in matters
25 relating to public lands and those states, along with Nevada, have
26 been actively participating in cooperative efforts to acquire, evaluate
27 and share information and promote greater understanding of the
28 issues. Since Nevada can both contribute to and benefit from such
29 interstate activities, it is appropriate that [a subcommittee on matters
30 relating to public lands] the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
31 Natural Resources and Public Lands be assigned primary
32 responsibility for participating in them.
33 Sec. 16. NRS 218E.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 218E.520 1. [The Subcommittee] During each legislative
35 interim, the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
36 Resources and Public Lands must hold at least three meetings
37 where the primary physical location for the meeting is:
38 (a) Located in a different county for each such meeting; and
39 (b) Not located in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson
40 City for each such meeting,
41  except that this subsection does not prohibit any additional
42 physical locations for such a meeting from being located in Clark
43 County, Washoe County or Carson City and connected to the
44 primary physical location for the meeting through the use of any
45 authorized remote-technology system or otherwise prohibit the use
-
*AB243_R2*

22 (d) Direct the Legislative Counsel Bureau to assist in its
23 research, investigations, review and comment;
24 (e) Recommend to the Legislature as a result of its review any
25 appropriate state legislation or corrective federal legislation;
26 (f) Advise the Attorney General if it believes that any federal
27 policy, rule or regulation which it has reviewed encroaches on the
28 sovereignty respecting land or water or their use which has been
29 reserved to the State pursuant to the Constitution of the United
30 States;
31 (g) Enter into a contract for consulting services for land
32 planning and any other related activities, including, but not limited
33 to:

EXEMPT
(Reprinted with amendments adopted on June 5, 2023)
SECOND REPRINT A.B. 243
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 243–COMMITTEE ON
LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING COMMITTEE
ON LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS)
MARCH 3, 2023
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to legislative affairs.
(BDR 17-366)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to legislative affairs; making various changes
relating to legislative interim committees and presiding
officers of those committees; revising provisions relating
to Joint Interim Standing Committees; revising the
deadline to submit an application to the Joint Interim
Standing Committee on Education to serve on the Nevada
State Teacher Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task
Force; repealing the requirement that the Joint Interim
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services
review certain regulations; revising provisions relating to
legislative committee members and staff regulated by the
Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act and
Nevada Financial Disclosure Act; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
2 or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
3 business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
4 for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
5 committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
6 contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
7 applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)

*AB243_R2*

8 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
9 committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
10 require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
11 management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
12 and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
13 of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
14 particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
15 unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
16 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
17 position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
18 to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
19 Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
20 Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
21 Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
22 in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
23 principles of parliamentary law, sections 4-6 of this bill codify those existing
24 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
25 committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
26 enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
27 State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
28 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
29 Legislature that may evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction of
30 the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
31 Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
32 conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
33 provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
34 Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
35 select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
36 218E.320, 218E.330)
37 Sections 8-10 of this bill clarify and revise various requirements governing the
38 Joint Interim Standing Committees. Section 8 of this bill renames the Joint Interim
39 Standing Committee on Natural Resources as the Joint Interim Standing Committee
40 on Natural Resources and Public Lands. Sections 1, 15-17, 43 and 47.5 of this bill
41 make conforming changes. Section 8 additionally requires the appointing
42 authorities to appoint the committee members for each Joint Interim Standing
43 Committee, along with the Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than August 31
44 following the adjournment of each regular session. Section 8 also clarifies the
45 length of the terms that the committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs
46 serve while qualified.
47 Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Joint Interim Standing Committees to begin
48 holding their meetings on September 1 after the adjournment of each regular
49 session, instead of November 1 under existing law. Section 9 provides that if a
50 regular member cannot attend a meeting of the Committee, an alternate member
51 must be of the same political party as the regular member, and section 9 clarifies
52 that, when acting in place of a regular member, an alternate member has all the
53 powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
54 Existing law requires that any recommended legislation proposed by a Joint
55 Interim Standing Committee must be approved by a majority of the members of the
56 Senate and a majority of the members of the Assembly serving on the Committee.
57 (NRS 218E.325) Section 9 changes this requirement by providing that any
58 recommended legislation proposed by a Committee must be approved by a vote in
59 favor of such legislation by at least five members of the eight-member Committee,
60 regardless of their House.
61 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
62 Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental

63 purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 10 of this bill transfers such duties to the
64 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 44 of this bill
65 makes a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations
66 for legislation relating to government purchasing be submitted to the Joint Interim
67 Standing Committee on Government Affairs.
68 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
69 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
70 powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 15-17, 43
71 and 51 of this bill eliminate the Subcommittee and transfer its powers and duties to
72 the renamed Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Public
73 Lands. Section 16 of this bill requires the renamed Joint Interim Standing
74 Committee on Natural Resources and Public Lands to hold at least three meetings
75 during each legislative interim where the primary physical location of the meeting
76 is located in a different county for each such meeting other than Clark County,
77 Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 16 does not prohibit the use of
78 authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting, including when
79 necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to additional
80 physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
81 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
82 Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
83 System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
84 With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 18
85 and 19 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of each
86 Legislative Committee.
87 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
88 (NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 33-40 of this bill: (1) rename the Sunset
89 Subcommittee as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature; and (2) revise the
90 membership, organization and operations of the Sunset Committee.
91 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
92 committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
93 each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 of this bill revises the number of
94 such requests that may be made by the Sunset Committee of the Legislature.
95 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
96 Human Services to review certain regulations that are proposed or adopted by
97 certain licensing boards and that are related to health care. (NRS 439B.225)
98 Section 51 of this bill repeals the requirement that the Joint Interim Standing
99 Committee on Health and Human Services review such regulations. Sections 41
100 and 42 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate the requirement that such
101 regulations be submitted to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and
102 Human Services.
103 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
104 Teacher Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force to submit an application
105 to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before January 15 of
106 an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494) Section 46 of this bill moves the due date
107 of the application from January 15 of an even-numbered year to December 1 of an
108 odd-numbered year.
109 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
110 compiled by state or local governmental agencies and then reported to certain
111 legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461, 209.4818,
112 332.215, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 29-32, 44, 45 and 47 of this bill revise those
113 reporting requirements.
114 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
115 (Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
116 and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
117 any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
-
*AB243_R2*

– 4 –
118 session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
119 gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
120 value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
121 meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
122 “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
123 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
124 statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
125 (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
126 Sections 20-27 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
127 investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 22 of this bill defines a “legislative
128 committee investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or
129 trips that the chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events
130 or trips of the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative
131 staff members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
132 matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
133 legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 24 and 26 of this bill, such
134 legislative committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be
135 reported on financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act.
136 (NRS 281.5583, 281.5585)
137 Sections 24 and 26 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
138 informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
139 the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
140 staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
141 administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
142 meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
143 legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
144 Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
145 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
146 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
147 statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
148 of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
149 informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
150 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
151 statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
152 public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
153 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

5 Sec. 15. NRS 218E.500 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 218E.500 The Legislature finds and declares that:
7 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
8 sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
9 continuing concern to this State.
10 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
11 federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
12 management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
13 within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
14 as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
15 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
16 has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
17 subjected to regulations which sometimes are unreasonable,
18 arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or the scope of the
19 authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
20 regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment,
21 and judicially tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and
22 interests of the State and its citizens.
23 4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large
24 proportion of the total area have shown an interest in matters
25 relating to public lands and those states, along with Nevada, have
26 been actively participating in cooperative efforts to acquire, evaluate
27 and share information and promote greater understanding of the
28 issues. Since Nevada can both contribute to and benefit from such
29 interstate activities, it is appropriate that [a subcommittee on matters
30 relating to public lands] the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
31 Natural Resources and Public Lands be assigned primary
32 responsibility for participating in them.
33 Sec. 16. NRS 218E.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 218E.520 1. [The Subcommittee] During each legislative
35 interim, the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
36 Resources and Public Lands must hold at least three meetings
37 where the primary physical location for the meeting is:
38 (a) Located in a different county for each such meeting; and
39 (b) Not located in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson
40 City for each such meeting,
41  except that this subsection does not prohibit any additional
42 physical locations for such a meeting from being located in Clark
43 County, Washoe County or Carson City and connected to the
44 primary physical location for the meeting through the use of any
45 authorized remote-technology system or otherwise prohibit the use
-
*AB243_R2*

– 12 –
1 of any authorized remote-technology system for such a meeting.
2 As used in this subsection, “authorized remote-technology system”
3 has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 218A.806.
4 2. In addition to any other powers or duties, the Committee
5 may:
6 (a) Review and comment on any administrative policy, rule or
7 regulation of the:
8 (1) Secretary of the Interior which pertains to policy
