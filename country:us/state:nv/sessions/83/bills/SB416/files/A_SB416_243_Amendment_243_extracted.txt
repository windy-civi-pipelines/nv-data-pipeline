EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the Department of Motor Vehicles to
issue a 24/7 privilege to certain persons assigned to the statewide
sobriety and drug monitoring program; eliminating the authority of the
Department to issue a restricted driver’s license to such persons;
clarifying certain requirements relating to the testing of persons
assigned to the program; providing that a person assigned to the
program may be subject to increased monitoring, supervision,
treatment or testing under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law enacts the Nevada 24/7 Sobriety and Drug Monitoring Program Act, which
2 establishes a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that provides for the frequent
3 testing of persons assigned to the program to determine the presence of alcohol or a prohibited
4 substance in their system. (NRS 484C.372-484C.397) Among other requirements, existing
5 law requires a person assigned to the program to submit to testing to determine the presence of
6 alcohol in his or her system: (1) at a designated testing location at least twice each day; or (2)
7 using any other method approved under federal regulations. (NRS 484C.392) Section 4 of this
8 bill makes a technical correction to provide that the applicable definition of “testing” includes
9 other approved methods set forth in the federal definition. Section 6 of this bill likewise
10 makes a technical correction to provide that a designated law enforcement agency is not
11 required to establish testing locations if the testing method specified in the guidelines of a
12 political subdivision do not require testing at a physical location.
13 Existing law makes a person assigned to the program eligible for a restricted driver’s
14 license, which: (1) is valid while the person is a participant in the program; and (2) permits the
15 person to drive to and from a testing location, work, court appearances and certain other
16 locations. (NRS 483.490, 484C.392) Section 5 of this bill instead makes a person assigned to
17 the program eligible for a 24/7 privilege while the person is participating in and complying
18 with the requirements of the program. Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor
19 Vehicles to issue a 24/7 privilege to a person assigned to the program upon receiving certain
Senate Amendment No. 243 to Senate Bill No. 416 Page 4
20 notice from the court. A 24/7 privilege issued by the Department pursuant to section 1 permits
21 a person to drive while the person is participating in and complying with the requirements of
22 the program without the same limitations as were previously imposed under a restricted
23 driver’s license. A 24/7 privilege thereby permits a person to drive freely to any destination of
24 their choosing, provided the person continues to participate in and comply with the
25 requirements of the program. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define the term “24/7 privilege” for
26 the purpose of the Act. Sections 1, 5, 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes by
27 replacing the term “restricted driver’s license” with the term “24/7 privilege.”
28 Existing law requires a person assigned to the program to be subject to sanctions for: (1)
29 using alcohol or a prohibited substance while assigned to the program; or (2) failing or
30 refusing to undergo required testing. Under existing law, such sanctions include, without
31 limitation, incarceration. (NRS 484C.392) Section 5 expands the list of authorized sanctions
32 to include increased monitoring, supervision, treatment or testing.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.490 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.490 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, after a driver’s
3 license has been suspended or revoked and one-half of the period during which the
4 driver is not eligible for a license has expired, the Department may, unless the
5 statute authorizing the suspension or revocation prohibits the issuance of a
6 restricted license, issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
7 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
8 (a) To and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both; or
9 (b) To acquire supplies of medicine or food or receive regularly scheduled
10 medical care for himself, herself or a member of his or her immediate family.
11  Before a restricted license may be issued, the applicant must submit sufficient
12 documentary evidence to satisfy the Department that a severe hardship exists
13 because the applicant has no alternative means of transportation and that the severe
14 hardship outweighs the risk to the public if the applicant is issued a restricted
15 license.
16 2. [If the driver’s license of a person assigned to a program established
17 pursuant to NRS 484C.392 is suspended or revoked, the Department may issue a
18 restricted driver’s license to an applicant that is valid while he or she is
19 participating in and complying with the requirements of the program and that
20 permits the applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
21 (a) To and from a testing location established by a designated law enforcement
22 agency pursuant to NRS 484C.393;
23 (b) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
24 (c) To and from court appearances;
25 (d) To and from counseling; or
26 (e) To receive regularly scheduled medical care for himself or herself.
27 3.] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 62E.630, after a driver’s license has
28 been revoked or suspended pursuant to title 5 of NRS or NRS 392.148, the
29 Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
30 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
31 (a) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
32 or
33 (b) If applicable, to and from school.
Senate Amendment No. 243 to Senate Bill No. 416 Page 5
1 [4.] 3. After a driver’s license has been suspended pursuant to NRS 483.443,
2 the Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
3 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
4 (a) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
5 (b) To receive regularly scheduled medical care for himself, herself or a
6 member of his or her immediate family; or
7 (c) If applicable, as necessary to exercise a court-ordered right to visit a child.
8 [5.] 4. A driver who violates a condition of a restricted license issued pursuant
9 to subsection 1 or 2 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, if the license of the driver was
10 suspended or revoked for:
11 (a) A violation of NRS 484C.110, 484C.210 or 484C.430;
12 (b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical control of a
13 vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or
14 resulting from any other conduct prohibited by NRS 484C.110, 484C.130 or
15 484C.430; or
16 (c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same or
17 similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b),
18  the driver shall be punished in the manner provided pursuant to subsection 2 of
19 NRS 483.560.
20 [6.] 5. The periods of suspensions and revocations required pursuant to this
21 chapter and NRS 484C.210 must run consecutively, except as otherwise provided
22 in NRS 483.465 and 483.475, when the suspensions must run concurrently.
23 [7.] 6. Whenever the Department suspends or revokes a license, the period of
24 suspension, or of ineligibility for a license after the revocation, begins upon the
25 effective date of the revocation or suspension as contained in the notice thereof.
26 [8.] 7. Any person for whom a court provides an exception relating to the
27 installation of an ignition interlock device pursuant to subsection 4 of NRS
28 484C.210 or subsection 2 of NRS 484C.460 is eligible for a [restricted driver’s
29 license] 24/7 privilege under this section while the person is participating in and
30 complying with the requirements of a program established pursuant to NRS
31 484C.392.
32 [9.] 8. If the Department receives a copy of an order requiring a person to
33 install an ignition interlock device in a motor vehicle pursuant to NRS 484C.460,
34 the Department shall issue an ignition interlock privilege to the person after he or
35 she submits proof of compliance with the order. A person who is required to install
36 an ignition interlock device pursuant to NRS 484C.210 or 484C.460 shall install the
37 device not later than 14 days after the date on which the order was issued. A driver
38 who violates any condition of an ignition interlock privilege issued pursuant to this
39 subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the same manner
40 provided in subsection 2 of NRS 483.560 for driving a vehicle while a driver’s
41 license is cancelled, revoked or suspended.
42 9. Upon receiving notice that a person is eligible for a 24/7 privilege
43 pursuant to subsection 6 of NRS 484C.394, the Department shall, in accordance
44 with any regulations adopted by the Department pursuant to subsection 7 of NRS
45 484C.394, issue a 24/7 privilege to the person. A 24/7 privilege is valid while the
46 person is participating in and complying with the requirements of a program
47 established pursuant to NRS 484C.392.
48 Sec. 2. Chapter 484C of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
49 section to read as follows:

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the statewide sobriety and drug
monitoring program. (BDR 43-423)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the Department of Motor Vehicles to
issue a 24/7 privilege to certain persons assigned to the statewide
sobriety and drug monitoring program; eliminating the authority of the
Department to issue a restricted driver’s license to such persons;
clarifying certain requirements relating to the testing of persons
assigned to the program; providing that a person assigned to the
program may be subject to increased monitoring, supervision,
treatment or testing under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law enacts the Nevada 24/7 Sobriety and Drug Monitoring Program Act, which
2 establishes a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that provides for the frequent
3 testing of persons assigned to the program to determine the presence of alcohol or a prohibited
4 substance in their system. (NRS 484C.372-484C.397) Among other requirements, existing
5 law requires a person assigned to the program to submit to testing to determine the presence of
6 alcohol in his or her system: (1) at a designated testing location at least twice each day; or (2)
7 using any other method approved under federal regulations. (NRS 484C.392) Section 4 of this
8 bill makes a technical correction to provide that the applicable definition of “testing” includes
9 other approved methods set forth in the federal definition. Section 6 of this bill likewise
10 makes a technical correction to provide that a designated law enforcement agency is not
11 required to establish testing locations if the testing method specified in the guidelines of a
12 political subdivision do not require testing at a physical location.
13 Existing law makes a person assigned to the program eligible for a restricted driver’s
14 license, which: (1) is valid while the person is a participant in the program; and (2) permits the
15 person to drive to and from a testing location, work, court appearances and certain other
16 locations. (NRS 483.490, 484C.392) Section 5 of this bill instead makes a person assigned to
17 the program eligible for a 24/7 privilege while the person is participating in and complying
18 with the requirements of the program. Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor
19 Vehicles to issue a 24/7 privilege to a person assigned to the program upon receiving certain

Senate Amendment No. 243 to Senate Bill No. 416 Page 4
20 notice from the court. A 24/7 privilege issued by the Department pursuant to section 1 permits
21 a person to drive while the person is participating in and complying with the requirements of
22 the program without the same limitations as were previously imposed under a restricted
23 driver’s license. A 24/7 privilege thereby permits a person to drive freely to any destination of
24 their choosing, provided the person continues to participate in and comply with the
25 requirements of the program. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define the term “24/7 privilege” for
26 the purpose of the Act. Sections 1, 5, 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes by
27 replacing the term “restricted driver’s license” with the term “24/7 privilege.”
28 Existing law requires a person assigned to the program to be subject to sanctions for: (1)
29 using alcohol or a prohibited substance while assigned to the program; or (2) failing or
30 refusing to undergo required testing. Under existing law, such sanctions include, without
31 limitation, incarceration. (NRS 484C.392) Section 5 expands the list of authorized sanctions
32 to include increased monitoring, supervision, treatment or testing.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.490 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.490 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, after a driver’s
3 license has been suspended or revoked and one-half of the period during which the
4 driver is not eligible for a license has expired, the Department may, unless the
5 statute authorizing the suspension or revocation prohibits the issuance of a
6 restricted license, issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
7 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
8 (a) To and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both; or
9 (b) To acquire supplies of medicine or food or receive regularly scheduled
10 medical care for himself, herself or a member of his or her immediate family.
11  Before a restricted license may be issued, the applicant must submit sufficient
12 documentary evidence to satisfy the Department that a severe hardship exists
13 because the applicant has no alternative means of transportation and that the severe
14 hardship outweighs the risk to the public if the applicant is issued a restricted
15 license.
16 2. [If the driver’s license of a person assigned to a program established
17 pursuant to NRS 484C.392 is suspended or revoked, the Department may issue a
18 restricted driver’s license to an applicant that is valid while he or she is
19 participating in and complying with the requirements of the program and that
20 permits the applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
21 (a) To and from a testing location established by a designated law enforcement
22 agency pursuant to NRS 484C.393;
23 (b) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
24 (c) To and from court appearances;
25 (d) To and from counseling; or
26 (e) To receive regularly scheduled medical care for himself or herself.
27 3.] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 62E.630, after a driver’s license has
28 been revoked or suspended pursuant to title 5 of NRS or NRS 392.148, the
29 Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
30 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
31 (a) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
32 or
33 (b) If applicable, to and from school.

Senate Amendment No. 243 to Senate Bill No. 416 Page 5
1 [4.] 3. After a driver’s license has been suspended pursuant to NRS 483.443,
2 the Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting the
3 applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
4 (a) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her work, or both;
5 (b) To receive regularly scheduled medical care for himself, herself or a
6 member of his or her immediate family; or
7 (c) If applicable, as necessary to exercise a court-ordered right to visit a child.
8 [5.] 4. A driver who violates a condition of a restricted license issued pursuant
9 to subsection 1 or 2 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, if the license of the driver was
10 suspended or revoked for:
11 (a) A violation of NRS 484C.110, 484C.210 or 484C.430;
12 (b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical control of a
13 vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance or
14 resulting from any other conduct prohibited by NRS 484C.110, 484C.130 or
15 484C.430; or
16 (c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same or
17 similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b),
18  the driver shall be punished in the manner provided pursuant to subsection 2 of
19 NRS 483.560.
20 [6.] 5. The periods of suspensions and revocations required pursuant to this
21 chapter and NRS 484C.210 must run consecutively, except as otherwise provided
22 in NRS 483.465 and 483.475, when the suspensions must run concurrently.
23 [7.] 6. Whenever the Department suspends or revokes a license, the period of
24 suspension, or of ineligibility for a license after the revocation, begins upon the
25 effective date of the revocation or suspension as contained in the notice thereof.
26 [8.] 7. Any person for whom a court provides an exception relating to the
27 installation of an ignition interlock device pursuant to subsection 4 of NRS
28 484C.210 or subsection 2 of NRS 484C.460 is eligible for a [restricted driver’s
29 license] 24/7 privilege under this section while the person is participating in and
30 complying with the requirements of a program established pursuant to NRS
31 484C.392.
32 [9.] 8. If the Department receives a copy of an order requiring a person to
33 install an ignition interlock device in a motor vehicle pursuant to NRS 484C.460,
34 the Department shall issue an ignition interlock privilege to the person after he or
35 she submits proof of compliance with the order. A person who is required to install
36 an ignition interlock device pursuant to NRS 484C.210 or 484C.460 shall install the
37 device not later than 14 days after the date on which the order was issued. A driver
38 who violates any condition of an ignition interlock privilege issued pursuant to this
39 subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the same manner
40 provided in subsection 2 of NRS 483.560 for driving a vehicle while a driver’s
41 license is cancelled, revoked or suspended.
42 9. Upon receiving notice that a person is eligible for a 24/7 privilege
43 pursuant to subsection 6 of NRS 484C.394, the Department shall, in accordance
44 with any regulations adopted by the Department pursuant to subsection 7 of NRS
45 484C.394, issue a 24/7 privilege to the person. A 24/7 privilege is valid while the
46 person is participating in and complying with the requirements of a program
47 established pursuant to NRS 484C.392.
48 Sec. 2. Chapter 484C of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
49 section to read as follows:
50 “24/7 privilege” means a license issued by the Department pursuant to
51 subsection 9 of NRS 483.490 which authorizes the holder to operate a motor
52 vehicle while assigned to the program.

20 with electronic monitoring, provided the person under confinement or house arrest
21 is in fact being detained.
22 Sec. 8. 1. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing supplements to the
23 Nevada Administrative Code, substitute appropriately the term “24/7 privilege” for

26 issue to a person assigned to the program.
27 2. As used in this section, “program” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS
28 484C.385.
29 Sec. 9. This act becomes effective on the date on which the Director of
30 the Department of Motor Vehicles notifies the Governor and the Director of
