Senate Bill No. 416–Committee on
Growth and Infrastructure
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the Department of
Motor Vehicles to issue a 24/7 privilege to certain persons
assigned to the statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
program; eliminating the authority of the Department to issue
a restricted driver’s license to such persons; clarifying certain
requirements relating to the testing of persons assigned to the
program; providing that a person assigned to the program
may be subject to increased monitoring, supervision,
treatment or testing under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law enacts the Nevada 24/7 Sobriety and Drug Monitoring Program
Act, which establishes a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
provides for the frequent testing of persons assigned to the program to determine
the presence of alcohol or a prohibited substance in their system. (NRS 484C.372-
484C.397) Among other requirements, existing law requires a person assigned to
the program to submit to testing to determine the presence of alcohol in his or her
system: (1) at a designated testing location at least twice each day; or (2) using any
other method approved under federal regulations. (NRS 484C.392) Section 4 of
this bill makes a technical correction to provide that the applicable definition of
“testing” includes other approved methods set forth in the federal definition.
Section 6 of this bill likewise makes a technical correction to provide that a
designated law enforcement agency is not required to establish testing locations if
the testing method specified in the guidelines of a political subdivision do not
require testing at a physical location.
Existing law makes a person assigned to the program eligible for a restricted
driver’s license, which: (1) is valid while the person is a participant in the program;
and (2) permits the person to drive to and from a testing location, work, court
appearances and certain other locations. (NRS 483.490, 484C.392) Section 5 of this
bill instead makes a person assigned to the program eligible for a 24/7 privilege
while the person is participating in and complying with the requirements of the
program. Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a
24/7 privilege to a person assigned to the program upon receiving certain notice
from the court. A 24/7 privilege issued by the Department pursuant to section 1
permits a person to drive while the person is participating in and complying with
the requirements of the program without the same limitations as were previously
imposed under a restricted driver’s license. A 24/7 privilege thereby permits a
person to drive freely to any destination of their choosing, provided the person
continues to participate in and comply with the requirements of the program.
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define the term “24/7 privilege” for the purpose of the
Act. Sections 1, 5, 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes by replacing the
term “restricted driver’s license” with the term “24/7 privilege.”
Existing law requires a person assigned to the program to be subject to
sanctions for: (1) using alcohol or a prohibited substance while assigned to the
program; or (2) failing or refusing to undergo required testing. Under existing
law, such sanctions include, without limitation, incarceration. (NRS 484C.392)

Section 5 expands the list of authorized sanctions to include increased monitoring,
supervision, treatment or testing.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 483.490 is hereby amended to read as follows:
483.490 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, after
a driver’s license has been suspended or revoked and one-half of the
period during which the driver is not eligible for a license has

the applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
(a) To and from work or in the course of his or her work, or
both; or
(b) To acquire supplies of medicine or food or receive regularly
scheduled medical care for himself, herself or a member of his or
her immediate family.
 Before a restricted license may be issued, the applicant must
submit sufficient documentary evidence to satisfy the Department
that a severe hardship exists because the applicant has no alternative
means of transportation and that the severe hardship outweighs the
risk to the public if the applicant is issued a restricted license.
2. [If the driver’s license of a person assigned to a program
established pursuant to NRS 484C.392 is suspended or revoked, the
Department may issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant
that is valid while he or she is participating in and complying with
the requirements of the program and that permits the applicant to
drive a motor vehicle:
(a) To and from a testing location established by a designated
law enforcement agency pursuant to NRS 484C.393;
(b) If applicable, to and from work or in the course of his or her

issued pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 is guilty of a misdemeanor and,

other conduct prohibited by NRS 484C.110, 484C.130 or 484C.430;
or

the same or similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b),
 the driver shall be punished in the manner provided pursuant to

[6.] 5. The periods of suspensions and revocations required
pursuant to this chapter and NRS 484C.210 must run consecutively,
except as otherwise provided in NRS 483.465 and 483.475, when
the suspensions must run concurrently.
[7.] 6. Whenever the Department suspends or revokes a
license, the period of suspension, or of ineligibility for a license
after the revocation, begins upon the effective date of the revocation
or suspension as contained in the notice thereof.
[8.] 7. Any person for whom a court provides an exception
relating to the installation of an ignition interlock device pursuant to
subsection 4 of NRS 484C.210 or subsection 2 of NRS 484C.460 is
eligible for a [restricted driver’s license] 24/7 privilege under this
section while the person is participating in and complying with the
