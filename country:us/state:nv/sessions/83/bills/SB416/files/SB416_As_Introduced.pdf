Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the Department of
Motor Vehicles to issue a 24/7 privilege to certain persons
assigned to the statewide sobriety and drug monitoring
program; eliminating the authority of the Department to
issue a restricted driver’s license to such persons;
clarifying certain requirements relating to the testing of
persons assigned to the program; providing that a person
assigned to the program may be subject to increased
monitoring, supervision, treatment or testing under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law enacts the Nevada 24/7 Sobriety and Drug Monitoring Program
2 Act, which establishes a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
3 provides for the frequent testing of persons assigned to the program to determine
4 the presence of alcohol or a prohibited substance in their system. (NRS 484C.372-
5 484C.397) Among other requirements, existing law requires a person assigned to
6 the program to submit to testing to determine the presence of alcohol in his or her
7 system: (1) at a designated testing location at least twice each day; or (2) using any
8 other method approved under federal regulations. (NRS 484C.392) Section 4 of
9 this bill makes a technical correction to provide that the applicable definition of
10 “testing” includes other approved methods set forth in the federal definition.
11 Section 6 of this bill likewise makes a technical correction to provide that a
12 designated law enforcement agency is not required to establish testing locations if
-
*SB416*

– 2 –
13 the testing method specified in the guidelines of a political subdivision do not
14 require testing at a physical location.
15 Existing law makes a person assigned to the program eligible for a restricted
16 driver’s license, which: (1) is valid while the person is a participant in the program;
17 and (2) permits the person to drive to and from a testing location, work, court
18 appearances and certain other locations. (NRS 483.490, 484C.392) Section 5 of this
19 bill instead makes a person assigned to the program eligible for a 24/7 privilege
20 while the person is participating in and complying with the requirements of the
21 program. Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a
22 24/7 privilege to a person assigned to the program upon receiving certain notice
23 from the court. A 24/7 privilege issued by the Department pursuant to section 1
24 permits a person to drive while the person is participating in and complying with
25 the requirements of the program without the same limitations as were previously
26 imposed under a restricted driver’s license. A 24/7 privilege thereby permits a
27 person to drive freely to any destination of their choosing, provided the person
28 continues to participate in and comply with the requirements of the program.
29 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define the term “24/7 privilege” for the purpose of the
30 Act. Sections 1, 5, 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes by replacing the
31 term “restricted driver’s license” with the term “24/7 privilege.”
32 Existing law requires a person assigned to the program to be subject to
33 sanctions for: (1) using alcohol or a prohibited substance while assigned to the
34 program; or (2) failing or refusing to undergo required testing. Under existing law,
35 such sanctions include, without limitation, incarceration. (NRS 484C.392) Section
36 5 expands the list of authorized sanctions to include increased monitoring,
37 supervision, treatment or testing.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.490 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.490 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, after
3 a driver’s license has been suspended or revoked and one-half of the
4 period during which the driver is not eligible for a license has
5 expired, the Department may, unless the statute authorizing the
6 suspension or revocation prohibits the issuance of a restricted
7 license, issue a restricted driver’s license to an applicant permitting
8 the applicant to drive a motor vehicle:
9 (a) To and from work or in the course of his or her work, or
10 both; or
11 (b) To acquire supplies of medicine or food or receive regularly
12 scheduled medical care for himself, herself or a member of his or
13 her immediate family.
14  Before a restricted license may be issued, the applicant must
15 submit sufficient documentary evidence to satisfy the Department
16 that a severe hardship exists because the applicant has no alternative
17 means of transportation and that the severe hardship outweighs the
18 risk to the public if the applicant is issued a restricted license.
19 2. [If the driver’s license of a person assigned to a program
20 established pursuant to NRS 484C.392 is suspended or revoked, the

38 or
39 (c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits

41  the driver shall be punished in the manner provided pursuant to
42 subsection 2 of NRS 483.560.
43 [6.] 5. The periods of suspensions and revocations required

2 the suspensions must run concurrently.
3 [7.] 6. Whenever the Department suspends or revokes a
4 license, the period of suspension, or of ineligibility for a license
5 after the revocation, begins upon the effective date of the revocation
6 or suspension as contained in the notice thereof.
7 [8.] 7. Any person for whom a court provides an exception
8 relating to the installation of an ignition interlock device pursuant to
9 subsection 4 of NRS 484C.210 or subsection 2 of NRS 484C.460 is

18 ignition interlock device pursuant to NRS 484C.210 or 484C.460
19 shall install the device not later than 14 days after the date on which
20 the order was issued. A driver who violates any condition of an
21 ignition interlock privilege issued pursuant to this subsection is
22 guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished in the same manner
23 provided in subsection 2 of NRS 483.560 for driving a vehicle while
24 a driver’s license is cancelled, revoked or suspended.
25 9. Upon receiving notice that a person is eligible for a 24/7
26 privilege pursuant to subsection 6 of NRS 484C.394, the
27 Department shall, in accordance with any regulations adopted by
28 the Department pursuant to subsection 7 of NRS 484C.394, issue a

37 reference to the type of license the Department of Motor Vehicles is
38 authorized to issue to a person assigned to the program.
39 2. As used in this section, “program” has the meaning ascribed
40 to it in NRS 484C.385.
