Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

3 various subject areas, including health. Existing law further requires that such
4 standards established for courses in health include mental health and the
5 relationship between mental and physical health. (NRS 389.520) Section 1 of this
6 bill requires the standards developed for mental health education to: (1) correspond
-
*SB314*
– 2 –
7 with any social and emotional learning standards that are developed by the
8 Department of Education; (2) include, without limitation, the provision of
9 information concerning mental health, the promotion of mental health and
10 culturally appropriate and age-appropriate mental health resources, as defined in
11 section 1, to pupils; and (3) require the use of evidence-based mental health
12 curriculum.
13 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
14 to adopt regulations for licensing teachers and other educational personnel and
15 procedures for the issuance and renewal of such licenses. (NRS 391.019) Section 3
16 of this bill requires the regulations to include a requirement that an applicant for a
17 license to teach complete a course in mental health education before receiving the
18 license.
19 Existing law imposes certain additional requirements for applicants seeking the
20 renewal of a license to teach, including the provision of information certifying that
21 the applicant has completed a course in multicultural education. (NRS 391.034,
22 391.0345, 391.0347) Section 2 of this bill requires a teacher who is initially
23 licensed on or before July 1, 2027, to submit with the first application for renewal

30 professional development; and (4) allow such credits or hours to be used to satisfy
31 any existing requirements for professional development, in-service training or
32 continuing education otherwise imposed by the Commission by regulation. Section
33 4 of this bill requires school districts and charter schools to provide such
34 professional development training in mental health education by partnering with
35 certain entities. Section 4 additionally requires school districts and charter schools
36 to partner with the Nevada System of Higher Education and other school districts to
37 provide such professional development training in rural areas and online.

39 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers have access to high-
40 quality, ongoing professional development training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 6 of
41 this bill requires that such professional development training include training on
42 mental health education and encompass any social and emotional learning
43 standards developed by the Department.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public
2 Schools to establish standards of content and performance for courses of study in
3 various subject areas, including health. Existing law further requires that such
4 standards established for courses in health include mental health and the
5 relationship between mental and physical health. (NRS 389.520) Section 1 of this
6 bill requires the standards developed for mental health education to: (1) correspond
-
*SB314*

– 2 –
7 with any social and emotional learning standards that are developed by the
8 Department of Education; (2) include, without limitation, the provision of
9 information concerning mental health, the promotion of mental health and
10 culturally appropriate and age-appropriate mental health resources, as defined in
11 section 1, to pupils; and (3) require the use of evidence-based mental health
12 curriculum.
13 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
14 to adopt regulations for licensing teachers and other educational personnel and
15 procedures for the issuance and renewal of such licenses. (NRS 391.019) Section 3
16 of this bill requires the regulations to include a requirement that an applicant for a
17 license to teach complete a course in mental health education before receiving the
18 license.
19 Existing law imposes certain additional requirements for applicants seeking the
20 renewal of a license to teach, including the provision of information certifying that
21 the applicant has completed a course in multicultural education. (NRS 391.034,
22 391.0345, 391.0347) Section 2 of this bill requires a teacher who is initially
23 licensed on or before July 1, 2027, to submit with the first application for renewal
24 on or after July 1, 2027, proof of the completion of a course in mental health
25 education. Section 2 also requires the Commission to adopt regulations that: (1)

28 course or at least 30 hours of relevant professional development training; (3)
29 establish the process by which the Commission approves certain providers of such
30 professional development; and (4) allow such credits or hours to be used to satisfy
31 any existing requirements for professional development, in-service training or
32 continuing education otherwise imposed by the Commission by regulation. Section
33 4 of this bill requires school districts and charter schools to provide such
34 professional development training in mental health education by partnering with
35 certain entities. Section 4 additionally requires school districts and charter schools
36 to partner with the Nevada System of Higher Education and other school districts to
37 provide such professional development training in rural areas and online.
38 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
39 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers have access to high-
40 quality, ongoing professional development training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 6 of
41 this bill requires that such professional development training include training on
42 mental health education and encompass any social and emotional learning
43 standards developed by the Department.
