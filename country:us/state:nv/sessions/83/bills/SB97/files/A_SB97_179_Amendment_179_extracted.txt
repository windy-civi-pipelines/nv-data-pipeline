EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health insurance; [requiring the Executive Director of the

2 purchase of subsidized health plans by certain small employers and natural persons who are
3 citizens of the United States or otherwise lawfully present in the United States. (Chapter 695I
4 of NRS) [Section 1 of this bill requires the Executive Director of the Exchange, in
5 collaboration with the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Director
6 of the Department of Business and Industry and the Commissioner of Insurance, to: (1) apply
7 for a federal waiver to authorize any natural person to purchase a qualified health plan on the
8 Exchange, regardless of his or her immigration status, if the natural person otherwise qualifies
9 to purchase such a plan on the Exchange; and (2) conduct, or contract with an independent
10 actuary to conduct, an actuarial analysis before applying for the waiver to ensure that such
11 waiver will comply with certain federal requirements. (42 U.S.C. § 18052(b)) Section 2 of this
12 bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the waiver, if approved, would authorize
13 natural persons who are not lawfully present in the United States to purchase qualified health
14 plans. Section 4 of this bill makes an appropriation of $1,000,000 to the Exchange for the
15 costs of the actuarial analysis and other administrative tasks related to applying for and
16 implementing the waiver.]
17 Existing law creates the Board of Directors of the Exchange which consists of: (1) five
18 voting members appointed by the Governor; (2) one voting member appointed by the Majority
19 Leader of the Senate; (3) one voting member appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly; and
20 (4) three ex officio, nonvoting members. (NRS 695I.300) [Section 3 of this] This bill [: (1)]
21 requires [the Majority Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly to each appoint
Senate Amendment No. 179 to Senate Bill No. 97 Page 4
22 one additional voting member to the Board; and (2) makes a conforming change to the
23 number of members of the Board who must have certain expertise or experience to reflect the
24 increased number of members of the Board. Section 5 of this bill prescribes the length of the
25 initial terms of the new members added to the Board by section 3 to ensure that the terms of
26 the voting members of the Board are staggered.] that one member appointed by the
27 Governor be a member of an Indian tribe located in this State with expertise in health
28 care administration for an Indian tribe.
