Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate
2 the purchase of subsidized health plans by certain small employers and natural
3 persons who are citizens of the United States or otherwise lawfully present in the
4 United States. (Chapter 695I of NRS) Section 1 of this bill requires the Executive
5 Director of the Exchange, in collaboration with the Director of the Department of
6 Health and Human Services, the Director of the Department of Business and
7 Industry and the Commissioner of Insurance, to: (1) apply for a federal waiver to
8 authorize any natural person to purchase a qualified health plan on the Exchange,
9 regardless of his or her immigration status, if the natural person otherwise qualifies
10 to purchase such a plan on the Exchange; and (2) conduct, or contract with an
11 independent actuary to conduct, an actuarial analysis before applying for the waiver
12 to ensure that such waiver will comply with certain federal requirements. (42
13 U.S.C. § 18052(b)) Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate
14 that the waiver, if approved, would authorize natural persons who are not lawfully
15 present in the United States to purchase qualified health plans. Section 4 of this bill
16 makes an appropriation of $1,000,000 to the Exchange for the costs of the actuarial

26 members of the Board who must have certain expertise or experience to reflect the
27 increased number of members of the Board. Section 5 of this bill prescribes the
