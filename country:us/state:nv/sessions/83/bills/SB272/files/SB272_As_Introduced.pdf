AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; requiring the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association to adopt regulations
setting forth the process by which a pupil who transfers
schools may appeal a determination of eligibility to
participate in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic
activity or event at the school under certain
circumstances; requiring that any regulations adopted by
the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association relating
to the eligibility to participate in any sanctioned sport or
other interscholastic activity or event at the school to
which the pupil transfers authorize a pupil to demonstrate
a hardship by providing certain evidence; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association,
2 which governs, among other matters, the eligibility and participation of certain
3 children in sanctioned sports and interscholastic activities and events. (NRS
4 385B.050, 385B.060) Under existing regulations, any pupil who transfers to
5 another school is presumed ineligible to participate in any sanctioned sport at the
6 school to which the pupil transfers for 180 school days. (NAC 385B.716) Section 1
7 of this bill requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to adopt
8 regulations setting forth the process by which a pupil may appeal a determination of
9 eligibility to participate in any sanctioned sport or other interscholastic activity or
10 event at the school to which the pupil transfers if the determination imposes a
11 hardship on the pupil.
12 Section 2 of this bill provides that any rules or regulations adopted by the
13 Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association must authorize a pupil to demonstrate
