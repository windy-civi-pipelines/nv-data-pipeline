2 course or unit of a course of instruction concerning the human immunodeficiency
3 virus, the human reproductive system, related communicable diseases and sexual
4 responsibility. Existing law further requires notice to be given to a parent or
5 guardian of a pupil to whom such a course or unit of instruction will be offered and
6 requires the school district to provide a form for the parent or guardian of the pupil
7 to provide consent for the pupil to participate in the course or unit. (NRS 389.036)
8 This bill instead requires the school district to provide a form for the parent or
9 guardian of a pupil to refuse to authorize the pupil to participate in the course or
10 unit. This bill requires the school district to furnish the notice containing the form
11 to the parent or guardian not later than 4 weeks after the start of the school year or 4
12 weeks before the course or unit is to commence, whichever is earlier. This bill
13 additionally authorizes a school district to make the form available on the secure
14 Internet website of the school district and requires that the form include a notice
15 that a parent or guardian of a pupil may refuse permission for the pupil to
16 participate in a course or unit of sexuality education at any time during the school
17 year.
