4 responsibility. Existing law further requires notice to be given to a parent or

6 requires the school district to provide a form for the parent or guardian of the pupil
7 to provide consent for the pupil to participate in the course or unit. (NRS 389.036)
8 This bill instead requires the school district to provide a form for the parent or
9 guardian of a pupil to refuse to authorize the pupil to participate in the course or
10 unit. This bill additionally authorizes a school district to make the form available on
11 the secure Internet website of the school district and requires that the form include
12 an option for a parent or guardian of a pupil to refuse permission for the pupil to
13 participate in a course or unit of sexuality education: (1) for that school year only;
14 or (2) for any school year in which the pupil is enrolled in the school district.
