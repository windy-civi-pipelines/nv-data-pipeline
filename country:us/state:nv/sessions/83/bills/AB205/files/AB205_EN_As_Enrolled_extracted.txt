Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing
consent to participate in a course or unit of instruction
concerning the human immunodeficiency virus, the human
reproductive system, related communicable diseases and
sexual responsibility; revising requirements for forms used to
refuse authorization for a pupil to participate in such a course
or unit of a course; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
course or unit of a course of instruction concerning the human immunodeficiency
virus, the human reproductive system, related communicable diseases and sexual
responsibility. Existing law further requires notice to be given to a parent or
guardian of a pupil to whom such a course or unit of instruction will be offered and
requires the school district to provide a form for the parent or guardian of the pupil
to provide consent for the pupil to participate in the course or unit. (NRS 389.036)
This bill instead requires the school district to provide a form for the parent or
guardian of a pupil to refuse to authorize the pupil to participate in the course or
unit. This bill requires the school district to furnish the notice containing the form
to the parent or guardian not later than 4 weeks after the start of the school year or 4
weeks before the course or unit is to commence, whichever is earlier. This bill
additionally authorizes a school district to make the form available on the secure
Internet website of the school district and requires that the form include a notice
that a parent or guardian of a pupil may refuse permission for the pupil to
participate in a course or unit of sexuality education at any time during the school
year.
