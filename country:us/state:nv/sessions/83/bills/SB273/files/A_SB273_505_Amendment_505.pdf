10 certain employees who perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective
11 services, county managers and certain employees who perform tasks related to code
12 enforcement. Existing law also authorizes the spouse, domestic partner or minor child of any
13 such person and the surviving spouse, domestic partner or minor child of any such person who
14 was killed in the performance of his or her duties to obtain such court orders. (NRS 247.540,
15 250.140, 293.908) Sections 1-3 of this bill additionally authorize any civilian employee who
16 provides support services to a law enforcement agency and any firefighter or retired
17 firefighter to obtain such court orders.

19 display an alternate address on the person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license or
