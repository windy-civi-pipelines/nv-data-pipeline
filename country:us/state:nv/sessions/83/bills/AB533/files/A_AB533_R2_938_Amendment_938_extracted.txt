EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public school outside
the zone of attendance the pupil is otherwise required to attend in
certain circumstances; requiring the Department of Education to
establish a program to award grants of money for the purpose of
providing transportation to such pupils; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to zone the
2 school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and (2) allows pupils to
3 attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board of trustees of the school
4 district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a pupil to attend a public school
5 outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is otherwise required to attend if the public
6 school is not at capacity in the grade level of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to
7 attend the school. Section 2 additionally: (1) requires the board of trustees of each school
8 district to adopt policies and procedures governing the attendance of pupils at schools outside
9 the zone of attendance that such pupils are otherwise required to attend; (2) requires the
10 Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a process to review such policies and
11 procedures; (3) provides certain requirements governing the application process established by
12 a school district, including, without limitation, various factors that may not be considered
13 when determining whether to approve an application; (4) sets forth the process for the parent
14 or legal guardian of a pupil who submits an application to appeal certain decisions regarding
15 the application; and (5) requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction and each school
16 district to publish certain data concerning vacancies at each public school on the Internet
17 website maintained by the Department of Education and school district, respectively. Section
18 1 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation to
19 pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public school outside of
20 his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 2. Additionally, section 2 authorizes the
21 board of trustees of a school district to accept gifts and grants to carry out certain provisions
22 of section 2.
23 Section 1.5 of this bill requires the Department, to the extent that money is available,
24 to establish a program to award grants of money to organizations or the parent or legal
25 guardian of a pupil for the purpose of providing the pupil with transportation to attend
Assembly Amendment No. 938 to Assembly Bill No. 533 Second Reprint Page 4
26 a public school located outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is otherwise
27 required to attend. Section 1.5 additionally requires the Department to adopt regulations
28 as necessary to carry out the program.

53 pursuant to this paragraph must not be reduced during the period in which the
Assembly Amendment No. 938 to Assembly Bill No. 533 Second Reprint Page 7
1 school district accepts such applications unless a significant change in
2 circumstances, which was unforeseeable at the time the capacity was published
3 pursuant to this section, necessitates such a change, including, without
4 limitation, a change in capacity due to an issue with the facilities of the public
5 school. If the capacity of a public school is reduced during the period in which
6 the school district accepts such applications, the board of trustees shall ensure
7 that, not later than 15 days before the earliest date on which decisions on such
8 applications are to be made, there is published on the Internet website maintained

17 and procedures adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) has been approved to
18 permanently transfer to that public school without requiring an additional
19 application in any subsequent school year.
20 (f) Adopt a uniform methodology for calculating the capacity of each public
21 school within the school district for the purposes of paragraph (c). The
22 methodology must be publicly documented, applied consistently across all public
23 schools within the school district and published on the Internet website
24 maintained by the school district. The methodology adopted by a school district
25 must calculate the capacity of each public school within the school district based
26 on:
27 (1) Maximum building occupancy; or
28 (2) An occupancy level of not more than 1 person per 40 square feet of
29 instructional space.
30 (g) Prepare and submit an annual report to the Superintendent of Public
31 Instruction describing:

35 and
36 (2) For each application that was denied, the reason the board of trustees
37 of the school district denied the application.
38 5. The application process established by the board of trustees of a school
39 district pursuant to subsection 4 must prohibit the consideration of any of the
40 following factors in determining whether to approve an application:

42 (b) The participation of a pupil in any extracurricular activity or the skill of
43 a pupil in such an activity;
44 (c) Whether a pupil is a pupil with a disability;
45 (d) Whether a pupil is an English learner;
46 (e) The address at which the pupil resides; or
47 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, whether a pupil has
48 previously been subject to any disciplinary action. The board of trustees of a
49 school district may deny the application of a pupil who, in the school year for
50 which the application is submitted or in the immediately preceding school year,
51 was suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
52 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance
53 that a pupil is otherwise required to attend is denied or no action is taken on the
Assembly Amendment No. 938 to Assembly Bill No. 533 Second Reprint Page 8
1 application, the parent or legal guardian of the pupil may appeal the denial or
2 lack of action to the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
3 promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the superintendent of
4 the school district is final.
5 7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts and grants to
6 carry out the provisions of subsections 3 to 6, inclusive.
7 8. The State Board shall adopt regulations necessary to carry out the
8 provisions of this section.

21 expenses of a local government that are related to the provisions of this act.
22 Sec. 4. 1. This section and section 3 of this act become effective upon
23 passage and approval.
24 2. Sections 1 , 1.5 and 2 of this act become effective:
25 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and

51 was suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
52 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance
53 that a pupil is otherwise required to attend is denied or no action is taken on the

Assembly Amendment No. 938 to Assembly Bill No. 533 Second Reprint Page 8

2 lack of action to the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
3 promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the superintendent of
4 the school district is final.
5 7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts and grants to
