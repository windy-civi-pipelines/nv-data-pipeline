AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public
school outside the zone of attendance the pupil is
otherwise required to attend in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to
2 zone the school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and
3 (2) allows pupils to attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board
4 of trustees of the school district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a
5 pupil to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is
6 otherwise required to attend if the public school is not at capacity in the grade level
7 of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to attend the school. Section 2
8 additionally: (1) requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish an
9 application process to enable pupils to request such transfers between public
10 schools; (2) provides certain requirements governing the application process,
11 including, without limitation, various factors that may not be considered when
12 determining whether to approve an application; (3) sets forth the process for the
13 parent or legal guardian of a pupil who submits an application to appeal certain
14 decisions regarding the application; and (4) requires the Superintendent of Public
15 Instruction to publish certain data concerning vacancies at each public school on
16 the Internet website maintained by the Department of Education. Section 1 of this
17 bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation
18 to pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public
19 school outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 2. Additionally,
20 section 2 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to accept gifts and
21 grants to carry out certain provisions of section 2. Section 2 also requires the board
22 of trustees of each school district to submit to the Superintendent of Public
