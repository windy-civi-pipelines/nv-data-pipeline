AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public
school outside the zone of attendance the pupil is

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

2 zone the school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and
3 (2) allows pupils to attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board
4 of trustees of the school district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a

6 otherwise required to attend if the public school is not at capacity in the grade level
7 of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to attend the school. Section 2
8 additionally: (1) requires the board of trustees of each school district to adopt
9 policies and procedures governing the attendance of pupils at schools outside the
10 zone of attendance that such pupils are otherwise required to attend; (2) requires the
11 Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a process to review such policies
12 and procedures; (3) provides certain requirements governing the application process
13 established by a school district, including, without limitation, various factors that
14 may not be considered when determining whether to approve an application; (4)
15 sets forth the process for the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who submits an
16 application to appeal certain decisions regarding the application; and (5) requires
17 the Superintendent of Public Instruction and each school district to publish certain
18 data concerning vacancies at each public school on the Internet website maintained
19 by the Department of Education and school district, respectively. Section 1 of this
20 bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation
21 to pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public
22 school outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 2. Additionally,

10 attend. The capacity determined pursuant to this paragraph must
11 not be reduced during the period in which the school district
12 accepts such applications unless a significant change in
13 circumstances, which was unforeseeable at the time the capacity
14 was published pursuant to this section, necessitates such a change,

22 pupil who, in the school year for which the application is
23 submitted or in the immediately preceding school year, was
24 suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.

27 or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal
28 guardian of the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to
29 the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
30 promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the
31 superintendent of the school district is final.

36 parent or legal guardian, and the principals of the schools

2 the school district.
3 (c) Determine the capacity for each grade level within each

8 accepting applications from pupils to attend a public school
9 outside the zone of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to
10 attend. The capacity determined pursuant to this paragraph must
11 not be reduced during the period in which the school district
12 accepts such applications unless a significant change in
13 circumstances, which was unforeseeable at the time the capacity
14 was published pursuant to this section, necessitates such a change,
15 including, without limitation, a change in capacity due to an issue
16 with the facilities of the public school. If the capacity of a public
17 school is reduced during the period in which the school district
18 accepts such applications, the board of trustees shall ensure that,
19 not later than 15 days before the earliest date on which decisions
20 on such applications are to be made, there is published on the
21 Internet website maintained by the school district a written
22 explanation of the change in circumstances which necessitated the

29 any specialized program.

31 with the policies and procedures adopted pursuant to paragraph
32 (a) has been approved to permanently transfer to that public
33 school without requiring an additional application in any
34 subsequent school year.
35 (f) Adopt a uniform methodology for calculating the capacity
36 of each public school within the school district for the purposes of
37 paragraph (c). The methodology must be publicly documented,
38 applied consistently across all public schools within the school
39 district and published on the Internet website maintained by the
40 school district. The methodology adopted by a school district must
41 calculate the capacity of each public school within the school
42 district based on:
43 (1) Maximum building occupancy; or
44 (2) An occupancy level of not more than 1 person per 40
45 square feet of instructional space.

22 pupil who, in the school year for which the application is
23 submitted or in the immediately preceding school year, was
24 suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
25 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone
26 of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to attend is denied
27 or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal
28 guardian of the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to
29 the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
30 promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the
31 superintendent of the school district is final.
