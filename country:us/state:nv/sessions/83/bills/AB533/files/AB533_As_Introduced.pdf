AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public
school outside the zone of attendance the pupil is
otherwise required to attend in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to
2 zone the school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and
3 (2) allows pupils to attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board
4 of trustees of the school district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a
5 pupil to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is
6 otherwise required to attend if the public school is not at capacity in the grade level
7 of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to attend the school. Section 2
8 additionally: (1) requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish an
9 application process to enable pupils to request such transfers between public
10 schools; (2) provides certain requirements governing the application process,
11 including, without limitation, various factors that may not be considered when
12 determining whether to approve an application; and (3) sets forth the process for the
13 parent or legal guardian of a pupil who submits an application to appeal certain
14 decisions regarding the application. Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of
15 trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation to pupils to elect not to
16 provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public school outside of his or her
17 zone of attendance pursuant to section 2. Additionally, section 2 authorizes the
18 board of trustees of a school district to accept gifts and grants to carry out certain
19 provisions of section 2.
