EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public
school outside the zone of attendance the pupil is

2 zone the school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and
3 (2) allows pupils to attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board
4 of trustees of the school district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a
5 pupil to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is
6 otherwise required to attend if the public school is not at capacity in the grade level
7 of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to attend the school. Section 2
8 additionally: (1) requires the board of trustees of each school district to adopt
9 policies and procedures governing the attendance of pupils at schools outside the
10 zone of attendance that such pupils are otherwise required to attend; (2) requires the
11 Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish a process to review such policies
12 and procedures; (3) provides certain requirements governing the application process
13 established by a school district, including, without limitation, various factors that
14 may not be considered when determining whether to approve an application; (4)
15 sets forth the process for the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who submits an
16 application to appeal certain decisions regarding the application; and (5) requires
17 the Superintendent of Public Instruction and each school district to publish certain
18 data concerning vacancies at each public school on the Internet website maintained
19 by the Department of Education and school district, respectively. Section 1 of this

20 bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation
21 to pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public
22 school outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 2. Additionally,
23 section 2 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to accept gifts and
24 grants to carry out certain provisions of section 2.
25 Section 1.5 of this bill requires the Department, to the extent that money is
26 available, to establish a program to award grants of money to organizations or the
27 parent or legal guardian of a pupil for the purpose of providing the pupil with
28 transportation to attend a public school located outside the zone of attendance that
29 the pupil is otherwise required to attend. Section 1.5 additionally requires the
30 Department to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out the program.

17 circumstances, which was unforeseeable at the time the capacity
18 was published pursuant to this section, necessitates such a change,
19 including, without limitation, a change in capacity due to an issue
20 with the facilities of the public school. If the capacity of a public
21 school is reduced during the period in which the school district
22 accepts such applications, the board of trustees shall ensure that,
23 not later than 15 days before the earliest date on which decisions

37 school without requiring an additional application in any
38 subsequent school year.

40 of each public school within the school district for the purposes of
41 paragraph (c). The methodology must be publicly documented,
42 applied consistently across all public schools within the school
43 district and published on the Internet website maintained by the
44 school district. The methodology adopted by a school district must
-

22 (d) Whether a pupil is an English learner;

26 board of trustees of a school district may deny the application of a
27 pupil who, in the school year for which the application is
28 submitted or in the immediately preceding school year, was
29 suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
30 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone
31 of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to attend is denied
32 or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal
33 guardian of the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to
34 the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
35 promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the
36 superintendent of the school district is final.
37 7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts
38 and grants to carry out the provisions of subsections 3 to 6,
39 inclusive.

12 effective upon passage and approval.
13 2. Sections 1, 1.5 and 2 of this act become effective:
14 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any

17 circumstances, which was unforeseeable at the time the capacity
18 was published pursuant to this section, necessitates such a change,
19 including, without limitation, a change in capacity due to an issue
20 with the facilities of the public school. If the capacity of a public
21 school is reduced during the period in which the school district

26 board of trustees of a school district may deny the application of a
27 pupil who, in the school year for which the application is
28 submitted or in the immediately preceding school year, was
29 suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
30 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone
31 of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to attend is denied
32 or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal
33 guardian of the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to
34 the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
35 promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the
36 superintendent of the school district is final.
37 7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts
