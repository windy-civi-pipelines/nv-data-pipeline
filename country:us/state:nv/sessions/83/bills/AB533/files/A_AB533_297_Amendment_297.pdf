AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public school outside
the zone of attendance the pupil is otherwise required to attend in
certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to zone the
2 school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and (2) allows pupils to
3 attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board of trustees of the school
4 district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a pupil to attend a public school
5 outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is otherwise required to attend if the public
6 school is not at capacity in the grade level of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to
7 attend the school. Section 2 additionally: (1) requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction
8 to establish an application process to enable pupils to request such transfers between public
9 schools; (2) provides certain requirements governing the application process, including,
10 without limitation, various factors that may not be considered when determining whether to
11 approve an application; [and] (3) sets forth the process for the parent or legal guardian of a
12 pupil who submits an application to appeal certain decisions regarding the application [.] ;
13 and (4) requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to publish certain data
14 concerning vacancies at each public school on the Internet website maintained by the
15 Department of Education. Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school
16 district that furnishes transportation to pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil
17 who attends a public school outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 2.
18 Additionally, section 2 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to accept gifts and
19 grants to carry out certain provisions of section 2. Section 2 also requires the board of
20 trustees of each school district to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction an
21 annual report concerning, without limitation: (1) transportation resources available to
22 the district; and (2) how such resources can be used to provide transportation to pupils
23 who submit an application to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance that
24 the pupils are otherwise required to attend.
