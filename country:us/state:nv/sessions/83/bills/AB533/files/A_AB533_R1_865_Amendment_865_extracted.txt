AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a pupil to attend a public school outside
the zone of attendance the pupil is otherwise required to attend in
certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to zone the
2 school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and (2) allows pupils to
3 attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board of trustees of the school
4 district. (NRS 388.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a pupil to attend a public school
5 outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is otherwise required to attend if the public
6 school is not at capacity in the grade level of the pupil and the pupil receives approval to
7 attend the school. Section 2 additionally: (1) requires the board of trustees of each school
8 district to adopt policies and procedures governing the attendance of pupils at schools
9 outside the zone of attendance that such pupils are otherwise required to attend; (2)
10 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to [establish an application process to
11 enable pupils to request such transfers between public schools; (2)] establish a process to
12 review such policies and procedures; (3) provides certain requirements governing the
13 application process [,] established by a school district, including, without limitation, various
14 factors that may not be considered when determining whether to approve an application; [(3)]
15 (4) sets forth the process for the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who submits an application
16 to appeal certain decisions regarding the application; and [(4)] (5) requires the Superintendent
17 of Public Instruction and each school district to publish certain data concerning vacancies at
18 each public school on the Internet website maintained by the Department of Education [.] and
19 school district, respectively. Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school
20 district that furnishes transportation to pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil
21 who attends a public school outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 2.
22 Additionally, section 2 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to accept gifts and
23 grants to carry out certain provisions of section 2. [Section 2 also requires the board of
24 trustees of each school district to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction an annual
25 report concerning, without limitation: (1) transportation resources available to the district; and
26 (2) how such resources can be used to provide transportation to pupils who submit an
27 application to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance that the pupils are
28 otherwise required to attend.]

22 (c) Determine the capacity for each grade level within each public school in
23 the school district in accordance with the provisions of this section [.] and

52 [(e)] (f) Adopt a uniform methodology for calculating the capacity of each
53 public school within the school district for the purposes of paragraph (c). The
Assembly Amendment No. 865 to Assembly Bill No. 533 First Reprint Page 7

2 schools within the school district and published on the Internet website
3 maintained by the school district. The methodology adopted by a school district
4 must calculate the capacity of each public school within the school district based
5 on:

14 applications that were approved or denied; and
15 (2) For each application that was denied, the reason the board of trustees
16 of the school district denied the application.

18 district pursuant to subsection [3] 4 must prohibit the consideration of any of the
19 following factors in determining whether to approve an application:

21 (b) The participation of a pupil in any extracurricular activity or the skill of
22 a pupil in such an activity;
23 (c) Whether a pupil is a pupil with a disability;
24 (d) Whether a pupil is an English learner;
25 (e) The address at which the pupil resides; or
26 (f) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, whether a pupil has
27 previously been subject to any disciplinary action. The board of trustees of a
28 school district may deny the application of a pupil who, in the school year for
29 which the application is submitted or in the immediately preceding school year,
30 was suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
31 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance
32 that a pupil is otherwise required to attend [submitted pursuant to subsection 3] is
33 denied or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal guardian of
34 the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to the superintendent of the
35 school district and he or she shall promptly approve or deny the application. The
36 decision of the superintendent of the school district is final.
37 7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts and grants to
38 carry out the provisions of subsections 3 to 6, inclusive.

42 pupils;
43 (b) The number of pupils enrolled in the school district who have applied to
44 attend a school outside the zone of attendance that the pupils are otherwise
45 required to attend pursuant to subsection 3; and
46 (c) An analysis of ways the resources available to the school district for the
47 transportation of pupils could be used to provide transportation to pupils who
48 have submitted an application to attend a school outside the zone of attendance
49 that the pupils are otherwise required to attend pursuant to subsection 3.] The
50 State Board shall adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this
51 section.
52 9. As used in this section:
Assembly Amendment No. 865 to Assembly Bill No. 533 First Reprint Page 8
1 (a) [“Capacity” means the number of pupils who can be adequately served by
2 a school in each grade level, calculated by subtracting the sum of the number of
3 pupils enrolled in the school at that grade level and the number of staff members
4 assigned to the school for that grade level from the maximum physical capacity of
5 the instructional space in the school dedicated to that grade level.
6 (b)] “Expelled” has the meaning ascribed to “expel” or “expulsion” in NRS

27 previously been subject to any disciplinary action. The board of trustees of a
28 school district may deny the application of a pupil who, in the school year for
29 which the application is submitted or in the immediately preceding school year,
30 was suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
31 6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone of attendance
32 that a pupil is otherwise required to attend [submitted pursuant to subsection 3] is
33 denied or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal guardian of
34 the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to the superintendent of the
35 school district and he or she shall promptly approve or deny the application. The
36 decision of the superintendent of the school district is final.
37 7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts and grants to

42 pupils;
43 (b) The number of pupils enrolled in the school district who have applied to
44 attend a school outside the zone of attendance that the pupils are otherwise

47 transportation of pupils could be used to provide transportation to pupils who
48 have submitted an application to attend a school outside the zone of attendance
49 that the pupils are otherwise required to attend pursuant to subsection 3.] The
50 State Board shall adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this
51 section.
