4. The board of trustees of each school district shall:
(a) Adopt policies and procedures governing the attendance of
pupils at schools outside the zone of attendance that a pupil is
otherwise required to attend pursuant to paragraph (f) of
subsection 2. Such policies and procedures must:
(1) Not deem a pupil ineligible to attend a public school
outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is otherwise required
to attend pursuant to paragraph (f) of subsection 2 on an arbitrary
basis, including, without limitation, based on the home address of
the pupil;
(2) Require all public schools within the school district,
except for magnet schools, career and technical academies and
dual enrollment high schools, to be open to the attendance of
pupils pursuant to paragraph (f) of subsection 2, subject to
capacity;
(3) Prohibit the assessment of any tuition or fees by a
public school within the school district to a pupil who attends the
school pursuant to paragraph (f) of subsection 2;
(4) Include a procedure for pupils to apply to attend a
public school outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is
otherwise required to attend pursuant to paragraph (f) of
subsection 2, including, without limitation, the date each year on
which the school district will begin accepting applications and the
annual deadline by which an application must be submitted;
(5) Not require a pupil to complete an application to attend
a public school unless the pupil is requesting to attend a public
school outside the zone of attendance that the pupil is otherwise
required to attend;
(6) Provide for the notification of a pupil and his or her
parent or legal guardian, and the principals of the schools
involved in the transfer of the pupil, if an application is approved;
and
(7) Include a method to determine which pupils to enroll in
any grade level within a public school for which applications
exceed the capacity limits established pursuant to paragraph (c),
which:
(I) Must give priority to pupils who live in the zone of
attendance for a public school that received, in the immediately
preceding school year, one of the two lowest ratings of

performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
public schools; and
(II) Except as otherwise provided in sub-subparagraph
(I), may include, without limitation, a lottery.
(b) On or before the first day of each calendar quarter, publish
on the Internet website maintained by the school district the
number of vacancies for each grade level in each public school in
the school district.
(c) Determine the capacity for each grade level within each
public school in the school district in accordance with the
provisions of this section and annually publish such capacity on
the Internet website maintained by the school district not later
than 90 days before the date on which the school district will begin
accepting applications from pupils to attend a public school
outside the zone of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to
attend. The capacity determined pursuant to this paragraph must
not be reduced during the period in which the school district
accepts such applications unless a significant change in
circumstances, which was unforeseeable at the time the capacity
was published pursuant to this section, necessitates such a change,
including, without limitation, a change in capacity due to an issue
with the facilities of the public school. If the capacity of a public
school is reduced during the period in which the school district
accepts such applications, the board of trustees shall ensure that,
not later than 15 days before the earliest date on which decisions
on such applications are to be made, there is published on the
Internet website maintained by the school district a written
explanation of the change in circumstances which necessitated the
reduction in capacity.
(d) Require a public school in the school district to enroll a
pupil whose application submitted in accordance with the policies
and procedures adopted pursuant to paragraph (a) has been
approved, so long as the public school has capacity at the grade
level of the pupil without taking into consideration the capacity of
any specialized program.
(e) Allow a pupil whose application submitted in accordance
with the policies and procedures adopted pursuant to paragraph
(a) has been approved to permanently transfer to that public
school without requiring an additional application in any
subsequent school year.
(f) Adopt a uniform methodology for calculating the capacity
of each public school within the school district for the purposes of
paragraph (c). The methodology must be publicly documented,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –
applied consistently across all public schools within the school
district and published on the Internet website maintained by the
school district. The methodology adopted by a school district must
calculate the capacity of each public school within the school
district based on:
(1) Maximum building occupancy; or
(2) An occupancy level of not more than 1 person per 40
square feet of instructional space.
(g) Prepare and submit an annual report to the Superintendent
of Public Instruction describing:
(1) The number of applications to attend a public school
outside the zone of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to
attend that were received by the school district and the number of
such applications that were approved or denied; and
(2) For each application that was denied, the reason the
board of trustees of the school district denied the application.
5. The application process established by the board of trustees
of a school district pursuant to subsection 4 must prohibit the
consideration of any of the following factors in determining
whether to approve an application:
(a) The academic, artistic or athletic ability of a pupil;
(b) The participation of a pupil in any extracurricular activity
or the skill of a pupil in such an activity;
(c) Whether a pupil is a pupil with a disability;
(d) Whether a pupil is an English learner;
(e) The address at which the pupil resides; or
(f) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, whether a
pupil has previously been subject to any disciplinary action. The
board of trustees of a school district may deny the application of a
pupil who, in the school year for which the application is
submitted or in the immediately preceding school year, was
suspended for 10 or more days or expelled.
6. If an application to attend a public school outside the zone
of attendance that a pupil is otherwise required to attend is denied
or no action is taken on the application, the parent or legal
guardian of the pupil may appeal the denial or lack of action to
the superintendent of the school district and he or she shall
promptly approve or deny the application. The decision of the
superintendent of the school district is final.
7. The board of trustees of a school district may accept gifts
and grants to carry out the provisions of subsections 3 to 6,
inclusive.
