AN ACT relating to parole; authorizing the State Board of Parole Commissioners to
grant second look review to certain persons; making certain persons
convicted of certain crimes committed when the person was less than
25 years of age eligible for parole after serving a certain number of
years of incarceration; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Parole Commissioners to grant geriatric parole
2 to a person who is 65 years of age or older and meets certain criteria. (NRS 213.12155)
3 Section 1 of this bill likewise authorizes the Board to grant second look review to a person
4 convicted of a category A or B felony if the person: (1) has not been sentenced to death; (2)
5 does not pose a significant and articulable risk to public safety; [(2)] (3) has served [a certain
6 number of] not less than 10 years of the minimum term or minimum aggregate term of
7 imprisonment, as applicable, imposed by the court; and [(3)] (4) meets certain other criteria.
8 Section 1 also prescribes: (1) the procedure for initiating consideration for second look
9 review; and (2) certain requirements relating to scheduling and conducting a second look
10 review hearing. Finally, section 1 requires the Board to prescribe the terms and conditions of
11 release for a person for whom a second look review was conducted and provides that any such
12 person is under the supervision of the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of
13 Public Safety. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to make certain existing
14 definitions applicable to section 1.
15 Existing law makes a prisoner who was sentenced for certain offenses that were
16 committed when he or she was less than 18 years of age eligible for parole after the prisoner
17 has served: (1) 15 calendar years of incarceration, if the prisoner is incarcerated for having
18 been convicted of an offense that did not result in the death of a victim; or (2) 20 calendar
19 years of incarceration, if the prisoner is incarcerated for having been convicted of an offense
20 that resulted in the death of only one victim. (NRS 213.12135) Section 3 of this bill makes a
21 prisoner eligible for parole under these conditions when the prisoner was sentenced for an
22 offense that was committed when he or she was less than 25 years of age, rather than 18 years
23 of age.
24 Section 4 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of sections 1 and 3 apply to
25 an offense committed before, on or after January 1, 2026.
