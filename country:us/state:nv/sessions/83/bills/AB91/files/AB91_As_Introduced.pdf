AN ACT relating to parole; authorizing the State Board of Parole
Commissioners to grant second look parole to certain
persons; making certain persons convicted of certain
crimes committed when the person was less than 25 years
of age eligible for parole after serving a certain number of
years of incarceration; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Parole Commissioners to grant
2 geriatric parole to a person who is 65 years of age or older and meets certain
3 criteria. (NRS 213.12155) Section 1 of this bill likewise authorizes the Board to
4 grant second look parole to a person convicted of a category A or B felony if the
5 person: (1) does not pose a significant and articulable risk to public safety; (2) has
6 served a certain number of years of the minimum term or minimum aggregate term
7 of imprisonment, as applicable, imposed by the court; and (3) meets certain other
8 criteria. Section 1 also prescribes: (1) the procedure for initiating consideration for
9 second look parole; and (2) certain requirements relating to scheduling and
10 conducting a second look parole hearing. Finally, section 1 requires the Board to
11 prescribe the terms and conditions of second look parole for each person to whom
12 the Board grants second look parole and provides that any such person is under the
13 supervision of the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public
14 Safety. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to make certain existing
15 definitions applicable to section 1.
16 Existing law makes a prisoner who was sentenced for certain offenses that were
17 committed when he or she was less than 18 years of age eligible for parole after the
18 prisoner has served: (1) 15 calendar years of incarceration, if the prisoner is
19 incarcerated for having been convicted of an offense that did not result in the death

– 2 –
20 of a victim; or (2) 20 calendar years of incarceration, if the prisoner is incarcerated
21 for having been convicted of an offense that resulted in the death of only one
22 victim. (NRS 213.12135) Section 3 of this bill makes a prisoner eligible for parole
23 under these conditions when the prisoner was sentenced for an offense that was
24 committed when he or she was less than 25 years of age, rather than 18 years of
25 age.
26 Section 4 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of sections 1 and
27 3 apply to an offense committed before, on or after January 1, 2026.
