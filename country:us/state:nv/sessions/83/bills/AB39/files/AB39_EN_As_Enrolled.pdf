Assembly Bill No. 39–Committee on Education
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to charter schools; revising provisions governing
the membership of the State Public Charter School Authority;
revising provisions establishing the local educational agency
that is responsible for performing certain functions with
respect to charter schools; clarifying requirements for certain
information to be included in an application to renew the
charter contract of a charter school; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority for the purpose
of, among other duties: (1) sponsoring charter schools; and (2) providing oversight
to the charter schools it sponsors. (NRS 388A.150) Existing law further establishes
that the Authority consists of nine members, the manner of appointing those
members and the qualifications of those members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1 of
this bill provides that the nine members appointed under existing law are the voting
members of the Authority and that the voting members must be at least 21 years of
age. Section 1 also establishes the requirements governing the members of the
Authority that apply to all members, including voting and nonvoting members, and
the requirements that apply only to voting members. Section 2 of this bill makes a
conforming change to clarify that only voting members of the Authority are
required to complete certain training required by existing law. (NRS 388A.155)
Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that a majority of the
voting members, rather than all members: (1) is authorized to call a meeting of the
Authority; and (2) constitutes a quorum to enable the Authority to exercise its
power and authority. (NRS 388A.156)
Under existing law, the number of members of the Authority who may be
teachers or administrators employed by a charter school or charter management
organization in this State is limited to two members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1
revises the qualifications for a teacher or administrator employed by a charter
school or charter management organization to be eligible to serve as a member of
the Authority by: (1) removing the requirement that the charter school or charter
management organization employing the teacher or administrator must not have
ever received an annual rating established as one of the three lowest ratings of
performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools;
and (2) instead, requiring that the charter school at which the teacher or
administrator is employed must be in good standing according to the performance
framework set forth in its charter contract.
Existing law prohibits a member of the Authority, other than a member who is
a teacher or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management
organization, from being actively engaged in business with or holding certain
interests relating to charter schools. (NRS 388A.153) Under existing law, a charter
school is defined as a charter school organized under the laws of this State. (NRS
385.007) Section 1 provides that the prohibition against a member of the Authority
being actively engaged in business with or holding certain interests relating to
charter schools includes, without limitation, such an engagement in business or
interest in: (1) an educational management organization providing support or
operations to a charter school; or (2) a charter management organization operating a
charter school.

Existing law deems the Authority to be a local educational agency that is
responsible under state and federal law for: (1) providing a free and appropriate
public education to each pupil enrolled in a charter school sponsored by the
Authority; (2) the provision of special education and related services by a charter
school; and (3) directing money available from certain federal and state grant
programs to charter schools sponsored by the Authority, a college or university
within the Nevada System of Higher Education or a city or county. (NRS
388A.159) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for a college or university
within the System, or a city or county, that sponsors a charter school to enter into
an agreement with the Authority for the provision of any necessary functions of a
local educational agency. Instead, section 4 deems a college or university within
the System, or a city or county, to be a local educational agency, thereby making
the college or university, or city or county, responsible for performing the functions
of a local educational agency under state and federal law for the charter schools it
sponsors.
Under existing law, the governing body of a charter school seeking to renew its
charter contract is required to submit an application for renewal to the sponsor of
the charter school on or before October 15 of the final school year in which the
charter school is authorized to operate. Existing law requires the application for
renewal to include, without limitation, any information or data that: (1) the
governing body of the charter school determines supports the renewal of the charter
contract; and (2) is in addition to the information contained in the required
performance report previously submitted to the governing body by the sponsor and
any written response to that report. (NRS 388A.285) Section 5 of this bill clarifies
that any information or data to support the renewal of the charter contract is
information or data other than the previously submitted performance report and any
written response to that report.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
