AN ACT relating to charter schools; revising provisions governing
the membership of the State Public Charter School
Authority; revising provisions establishing the local
educational agency that is responsible for performing
certain functions with respect to charter schools;
clarifying requirements for certain information to be

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority for the purpose
2 of, among other duties: (1) sponsoring charter schools; and (2) providing oversight
3 to the charter schools it sponsors. (NRS 388A.150) Existing law further establishes
4 that the Authority consists of nine members, the manner of appointing those
5 members and the qualifications of those members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1 of
6 this bill provides that the nine members appointed under existing law are the voting
7 members of the Authority and that the voting members must be at least 21 years of
8 age. Section 1 also establishes the requirements governing the members of the
9 Authority that apply to all members, including voting and nonvoting members, and
10 the requirements that apply only to voting members. Section 2 of this bill makes a
11 conforming change to clarify that only voting members of the Authority are
12 required to complete certain training required by existing law. (NRS 388A.155)
13 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that a majority of the
-

– 2 –
14 voting members, rather than all members: (1) is authorized to call a meeting of the
15 Authority; and (2) constitutes a quorum to enable the Authority to exercise its
16 power and authority. (NRS 388A.156)
17 Under existing law, the number of members of the Authority who may be
18 teachers or administrators employed by a charter school or charter management
19 organization in this State is limited to two members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1
20 revises the qualifications for a teacher or administrator employed by a charter
21 school or charter management organization to be eligible to serve as a member of
22 the Authority by: (1) removing the requirement that the charter school or charter
23 management organization employing the teacher or administrator must not have
24 ever received an annual rating established as one of the three lowest ratings of
25 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools;
26 and (2) instead, requiring that the charter school at which the teacher or
27 administrator is employed must be in good standing according to the performance
28 framework set forth in its charter contract.
29 Existing law prohibits a member of the Authority, other than a member who is
30 a teacher or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management
31 organization, from being actively engaged in business with or holding certain
32 interests relating to charter schools. (NRS 388A.153) Under existing law, a charter
33 school is defined as a charter school organized under the laws of this State. (NRS
34 385.007) Section 1 provides that the prohibition against a member of the Authority
35 being actively engaged in business with or holding certain interests relating to
36 charter schools includes, without limitation, such an engagement in business or
37 interest in: (1) an educational management organization providing support or
38 operations to a charter school; or (2) a charter management organization operating a
39 charter school.
40 Existing law deems the Authority to be a local educational agency that is
41 responsible under state and federal law for: (1) providing a free and appropriate
42 public education to each pupil enrolled in a charter school sponsored by the
43 Authority; (2) the provision of special education and related services by a charter
44 school; and (3) directing money available from certain federal and state grant
45 programs to charter schools sponsored by the Authority, a college or university
46 within the Nevada System of Higher Education or a city or county. (NRS
47 388A.159) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for a college or university
48 within the System, or a city or county, that sponsors a charter school to enter into
49 an agreement with the Authority for the provision of any necessary functions of a
50 local educational agency. Instead, section 4 deems a college or university within
51 the System, or a city or county, to be a local educational agency, thereby making
52 the college or university, or city or county, responsible for performing the functions
53 of a local educational agency under state and federal law for the charter schools it
54 sponsors.
55 Under existing law, the governing body of a charter school seeking to renew its
56 charter contract is required to submit an application for renewal to the sponsor of
57 the charter school on or before October 15 of the final school year in which the
58 charter school is authorized to operate. Existing law requires the application for
59 renewal to include, without limitation, any information or data that: (1) the
60 governing body of the charter school determines supports the renewal of the charter
61 contract; and (2) is in addition to the information contained in the required
62 performance report previously submitted to the governing body by the sponsor and
63 any written response to that report. (NRS 388A.285) Section 5 of this bill clarifies
64 that any information or data to support the renewal of the charter contract is
65 information or data other than the previously submitted performance report and any
66 written response to that report.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to charter schools; revising provisions governing
the membership of the State Public Charter School
Authority; revising provisions establishing the local
educational agency that is responsible for performing
certain functions with respect to charter schools;
clarifying requirements for certain information to be
included in an application to renew the charter contract of

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority for the purpose
2 of, among other duties: (1) sponsoring charter schools; and (2) providing oversight
3 to the charter schools it sponsors. (NRS 388A.150) Existing law further establishes
4 that the Authority consists of nine members, the manner of appointing those
5 members and the qualifications of those members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1 of
6 this bill provides that the nine members appointed under existing law are the voting
7 members of the Authority and that the voting members must be at least 21 years of
8 age. Section 1 also establishes the requirements governing the members of the
9 Authority that apply to all members, including voting and nonvoting members, and
10 the requirements that apply only to voting members. Section 2 of this bill makes a
11 conforming change to clarify that only voting members of the Authority are
12 required to complete certain training required by existing law. (NRS 388A.155)
13 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that a majority of the
-

– 2 –
14 voting members, rather than all members: (1) is authorized to call a meeting of the
15 Authority; and (2) constitutes a quorum to enable the Authority to exercise its
16 power and authority. (NRS 388A.156)
17 Under existing law, the number of members of the Authority who may be
18 teachers or administrators employed by a charter school or charter management
19 organization in this State is limited to two members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1
20 revises the qualifications for a teacher or administrator employed by a charter
21 school or charter management organization to be eligible to serve as a member of
22 the Authority by: (1) removing the requirement that the charter school or charter
23 management organization employing the teacher or administrator must not have
24 ever received an annual rating established as one of the three lowest ratings of
25 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools;
26 and (2) instead, requiring that the charter school at which the teacher or
27 administrator is employed must be in good standing according to the performance
28 framework set forth in its charter contract.
29 Existing law prohibits a member of the Authority, other than a member who is
30 a teacher or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management
31 organization, from being actively engaged in business with or holding certain
32 interests relating to charter schools. (NRS 388A.153) Under existing law, a charter
33 school is defined as a charter school organized under the laws of this State. (NRS
34 385.007) Section 1 provides that the prohibition against a member of the Authority
35 being actively engaged in business with or holding certain interests relating to
36 charter schools includes, without limitation, such an engagement in business or
37 interest in: (1) an educational management organization providing support or
38 operations to a charter school; or (2) a charter management organization operating a
39 charter school.
40 Existing law deems the Authority to be a local educational agency that is
41 responsible under state and federal law for: (1) providing a free and appropriate
42 public education to each pupil enrolled in a charter school sponsored by the
43 Authority; (2) the provision of special education and related services by a charter
44 school; and (3) directing money available from certain federal and state grant
45 programs to charter schools sponsored by the Authority, a college or university
46 within the Nevada System of Higher Education or a city or county. (NRS
47 388A.159) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for a college or university
48 within the System, or a city or county, that sponsors a charter school to enter into
49 an agreement with the Authority for the provision of any necessary functions of a
50 local educational agency. Instead, section 4 deems a college or university within
51 the System, or a city or county, to be a local educational agency, thereby making
52 the college or university, or city or county, responsible for performing the functions
53 of a local educational agency under state and federal law for the charter schools it
54 sponsors.
55 Under existing law, the governing body of a charter school seeking to renew its
56 charter contract is required to submit an application for renewal to the sponsor of
57 the charter school on or before October 15 of the final school year in which the
58 charter school is authorized to operate. Existing law requires the application for
59 renewal to include, without limitation, any information or data that: (1) the
60 governing body of the charter school determines supports the renewal of the charter
61 contract; and (2) is in addition to the information contained in the required
62 performance report previously submitted to the governing body by the sponsor and
63 any written response to that report. (NRS 388A.285) Section 5 of this bill clarifies
64 that any information or data to support the renewal of the charter contract is
65 information or data other than the previously submitted performance report and any
66 written response to that report.
