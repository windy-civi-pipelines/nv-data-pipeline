AN ACT relating to charter schools; revising provisions governing the membership
of the State Public Charter School Authority; revising provisions
establishing the local educational agency that is responsible for
performing certain functions with respect to charter schools; clarifying
requirements for certain information to be included in an application to
renew the charter contract of a charter school; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority for the purpose of, among
2 other duties: (1) sponsoring charter schools; and (2) providing oversight to the charter schools
3 it sponsors. (NRS 388A.150) Existing law further establishes that the Authority consists of
4 nine members, the manner of appointing those members and the qualifications of those
5 members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1 of this bill provides that the nine members appointed
6 under existing law are the voting members of the Authority and that the voting members must
7 be at least 21 years of age. Section 1 also establishes the requirements governing the members
8 of the Authority that apply to all members, including voting and nonvoting members, and the
9 requirements that apply only to voting members. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming
10 change to clarify that only voting members of the Authority are required to complete certain
11 training required by existing law. (NRS 388A.155) Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
12 change to clarify that a majority of the voting members, rather than all members: (1) is
13 authorized to call a meeting of the Authority; and (2) constitutes a quorum to enable the
14 Authority to exercise its power and authority. (NRS 388A.156)
15 Under existing law, the number of members of the Authority who may be teachers or
16 administrators employed by a charter school or charter management organization in this State
17 is limited to two members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1 revises the qualifications for a teacher
18 or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management organization to be
19 eligible to serve as a member of the Authority by: (1) removing the requirement that the
20 charter school or charter management organization employing the teacher or administrator

Senate Amendment No. 772 to Assembly Bill No. 39 Page 4
21 must not have ever received an annual rating established as one of the three lowest ratings of
22 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools; and (2)
23 instead, requiring that the charter school at which the teacher or administrator is employed
24 must be in good standing according to the performance framework set forth in its charter
25 contract.
26 Existing law prohibits a member of the Authority, other than a member who is a teacher
27 or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management organization, from
28 being actively engaged in business with or holding certain interests relating to charter schools.
29 (NRS 388A.153) Under existing law, a charter school is defined as a charter school organized
30 under the laws of this State. (NRS 385.007) Section 1 [clarifies] provides that the prohibition
31 against a member of the Authority being actively engaged in business with or holding certain
32 interests relating to charter schools [only prohibits engaging in business with or holding
33 certain interests relating to a charter school in this State.] includes, without limitation, such
34 an engagement in business or interest in: (1) an educational management organization
35 providing support or operations to a charter school; or (2) a charter management
36 organization operating a charter school.
37 Existing law deems the Authority to be a local educational agency that is responsible
38 under state and federal law for: (1) providing a free and appropriate public education to each
39 pupil enrolled in a charter school sponsored by the Authority; (2) the provision of special
40 education and related services by a charter school; and (3) directing money available from
41 certain federal and state grant programs to charter schools sponsored by the Authority, a
42 college or university within the Nevada System of Higher Education or a city or county. (NRS
43 388A.159) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for a college or university within the
44 System, or a city or county, that sponsors a charter school to enter into an agreement with the
45 Authority for the provision of any necessary functions of a local educational agency. Instead,
46 section 4 deems a college or university within the System, or a city or county, to be a local
47 educational agency, thereby making the college or university, or city or county, responsible
48 for performing the functions of a local educational agency under state and federal law for the
49 charter schools it sponsors.
50 Under existing law, the governing body of a charter school seeking to renew its charter
51 contract is required to submit an application for renewal to the sponsor of the charter school
52 on or before October 15 of the final school year in which the charter school is authorized to
53 operate. Existing law requires the application for renewal to include, without limitation, any
54 information or data that: (1) the governing body of the charter school determines supports the
55 renewal of the charter contract; and (2) is in addition to the information contained in the
56 required performance report previously submitted to the governing body by the sponsor and
57 any written response to that report. (NRS 388A.285) Section 5 of this bill clarifies that any
58 information or data to support the renewal of the charter contract is information or data other
59 than the previously submitted performance report and any written response to that report.
