Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority for the purpose
2 of, among other duties: (1) sponsoring charter schools; and (2) providing oversight
3 to the charter schools it sponsors. (NRS 388A.150) Existing law further establishes
4 that the Authority consists of nine members, the manner of appointing those
5 members and the qualifications of those members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1 of
6 this bill provides that the nine members appointed under existing law are the voting
7 members of the Authority and that the voting members must be at least 21 years of
8 age. Section 1 also establishes the requirements governing the members of the
9 Authority that apply to all members, including voting and nonvoting members, and
10 the requirements that apply only to voting members. Section 2 of this bill makes a
11 conforming change to clarify that only voting members of the Authority are
12 required to complete certain training required by existing law. (NRS 388A.155)
13 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that a majority of the
-

– 2 –
14 voting members, rather than all members: (1) is authorized to call a meeting of the
15 Authority; and (2) constitutes a quorum to enable the Authority to exercise its
16 power and authority. (NRS 388A.156)
17 Under existing law, the number of members of the Authority who may be
18 teachers or administrators employed by a charter school or charter management
19 organization in this State is limited to two members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1
20 revises the qualifications for a teacher or administrator employed by a charter
21 school or charter management organization to be eligible to serve as a member of
22 the Authority by: (1) removing the requirement that the charter school or charter
23 management organization employing the teacher or administrator must not have
24 ever received an annual rating established as one of the three lowest ratings of
25 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools;
26 and (2) instead, requiring that the charter school at which the teacher or
27 administrator is employed must be in good standing according to the performance
28 framework set forth in its charter contract.
29 Existing law prohibits a member of the Authority, other than a member who is
30 a teacher or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management
31 organization, from being actively engaged in business with or holding certain
32 interests relating to charter schools. (NRS 388A.153) Under existing law, a charter
33 school is defined as a charter school organized under the laws of this State. (NRS
34 385.007) Section 1 clarifies that the prohibition against a member of the Authority
35 being actively engaged in business with or holding certain interests relating to
36 charter schools only prohibits engaging in business with or holding certain interests
37 relating to a charter school in this State.
38 Existing law deems the Authority to be a local educational agency that is
39 responsible under state and federal law for: (1) providing a free and appropriate
40 public education to each pupil enrolled in a charter school sponsored by the
41 Authority; (2) the provision of special education and related services by a charter
42 school; and (3) directing money available from certain federal and state grant
43 programs to charter schools sponsored by the Authority, a college or university
44 within the Nevada System of Higher Education or a city or county. (NRS
45 388A.159) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for a college or university
46 within the System, or a city or county, that sponsors a charter school to enter into
47 an agreement with the Authority for the provision of any necessary functions of a
48 local educational agency. Instead, section 4 deems a college or university within
49 the System, or a city or county, to be a local educational agency, thereby making
50 the college or university, or city or county, responsible for performing the functions
51 of a local educational agency under state and federal law for the charter schools it
52 sponsors.
53 Under existing law, the governing body of a charter school seeking to renew its
54 charter contract is required to submit an application for renewal to the sponsor of
55 the charter school on or before October 15 of the final school year in which the
56 charter school is authorized to operate. Existing law requires the application for
57 renewal to include, without limitation, any information or data that: (1) the
58 governing body of the charter school determines supports the renewal of the charter
59 contract; and (2) is in addition to the information contained in the required
60 performance report previously submitted to the governing body by the sponsor and
61 any written response to that report. (NRS 388A.285) Section 5 of this bill clarifies
62 that any information or data to support the renewal of the charter contract is
63 information or data other than the previously submitted performance report and any
64 written response to that report.

3 to the charter schools it sponsors. (NRS 388A.150) Existing law further establishes

14 voting members, rather than all members: (1) is authorized to call a meeting of the

16 power and authority. (NRS 388A.156)
17 Under existing law, the number of members of the Authority who may be
18 teachers or administrators employed by a charter school or charter management
19 organization in this State is limited to two members. (NRS 388A.153) Section 1
20 revises the qualifications for a teacher or administrator employed by a charter
21 school or charter management organization to be eligible to serve as a member of
22 the Authority by: (1) removing the requirement that the charter school or charter
23 management organization employing the teacher or administrator must not have
24 ever received an annual rating established as one of the three lowest ratings of
25 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools;
26 and (2) instead, requiring that the charter school at which the teacher or
27 administrator is employed must be in good standing according to the performance
28 framework set forth in its charter contract.
29 Existing law prohibits a member of the Authority, other than a member who is
30 a teacher or administrator employed by a charter school or charter management
31 organization, from being actively engaged in business with or holding certain
32 interests relating to charter schools. (NRS 388A.153) Under existing law, a charter
33 school is defined as a charter school organized under the laws of this State. (NRS
34 385.007) Section 1 clarifies that the prohibition against a member of the Authority
35 being actively engaged in business with or holding certain interests relating to
36 charter schools only prohibits engaging in business with or holding certain interests
37 relating to a charter school in this State.
38 Existing law deems the Authority to be a local educational agency that is
39 responsible under state and federal law for: (1) providing a free and appropriate
40 public education to each pupil enrolled in a charter school sponsored by the
41 Authority; (2) the provision of special education and related services by a charter
42 school; and (3) directing money available from certain federal and state grant
43 programs to charter schools sponsored by the Authority, a college or university
44 within the Nevada System of Higher Education or a city or county. (NRS
45 388A.159) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for a college or university
46 within the System, or a city or county, that sponsors a charter school to enter into
47 an agreement with the Authority for the provision of any necessary functions of a
48 local educational agency. Instead, section 4 deems a college or university within
49 the System, or a city or county, to be a local educational agency, thereby making
50 the college or university, or city or county, responsible for performing the functions
51 of a local educational agency under state and federal law for the charter schools it
52 sponsors.
53 Under existing law, the governing body of a charter school seeking to renew its
54 charter contract is required to submit an application for renewal to the sponsor of
55 the charter school on or before October 15 of the final school year in which the
56 charter school is authorized to operate. Existing law requires the application for
57 renewal to include, without limitation, any information or data that: (1) the
58 governing body of the charter school determines supports the renewal of the charter
59 contract; and (2) is in addition to the information contained in the required
60 performance report previously submitted to the governing body by the sponsor and
61 any written response to that report. (NRS 388A.285) Section 5 of this bill clarifies
