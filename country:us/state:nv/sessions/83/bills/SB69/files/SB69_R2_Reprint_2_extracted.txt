EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring an applicant for the issuance
of transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of
certain taxes for a project that is located in an economic
diversification district to enter into an agreement with
certain local governments to defray the cost of services
provided by the local governments under certain
circumstances; revising provisions governing applications
for the issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that satisfies
certain capital investment and other requirements;
authorizing a fire protection district to abate certain fees;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 applications for an abatement or partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance
3 of transferable tax credits submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project
4 that will make a capital investment in this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS
5 360.880-360.980) Additionally, existing law authorizes the governing body of a
6 county or city in which a qualified project is or is expected to be located to: (1)
7 create an economic diversification district that includes within its boundaries the
8 qualified project; and (2) pledge for certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and
9 use taxes imposed in the county or city on each participant in the qualified project,
10 other than any sales and use taxes for which an abatement is received.
11 (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2 and 6 of this bill require, as a condition of
-
*SB69_R2*
– 2 –
12 eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the abatement or partial abatement of
13 taxes for a project that is or will be located in an economic diversification district,
14 the lead participant to enter into an agreement with the governing body of the city,
15 county or fire protection district in which the project is located, if the governing
16 body so requires, to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the cost
17 of local governmental services and infrastructure to service the project. Sections 2
18 and 6: (1) provide that the city or county in which a project is located is the lead
19 negotiator for all such agreements; and (2) authorize a city, county or fire
20 protection district that is not the lead negotiator to enter into an interlocal
21 agreement with the lead negotiator. Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 make records, files and
22 communications exchanged between the lead participant and a county, city or fire
23 protection district for the purpose of entering into certain agreements confidential
24 and prohibit the disclosure of such records, files and communications except with
25 the consent of the lead participant. Section 10 of this bill provides that these
26 records, files and communications are not public records. Section 11 of this bill
27 makes a conforming change to reflect that the governing body of a county or city is
28 authorized to enter into agreements with owners of any interest in property for the
29 payment of amounts to defray the costs of local government services, in addition to
30 the agreement which the governing body of the county or city is required to enter
31 into with the lead participant pursuant to sections 2 and 6.
32 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial
33 abatement for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital
34 investment in this State of at least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the
35 project has entered into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for
36 the abatement, including the date on which the abatement becomes effective, which
37 must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the application and
38 not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the application.
39 (NRS 360.889) Section 2 limits the requirement to state the effective date of the
40 partial abatement in the agreement to partial abatements of property taxes and
41 requires the effective date of such an abatement, as established by the agreement, to
42 be not earlier than July 1 of the fiscal year in which the Office executes the
43 agreement. Section 6 adds a similar requirement regarding the effective date of an
44 abatement to applications for an abatement for a qualified project whose
45 participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at least $3.5 billion.
46 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of
47 an application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of
48 taxes for a project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to
49 send a notification containing certain information to each city, county and fire
50 protection district in which the project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize
51 the disclosure of certain confidential information in an application to an officer or
52 employee of a county, city or fire protection district who is subject to an agreement
53 prohibiting further disclosure of the information. Sections 3 and 7 require the
54 Office to receive a letter of acknowledgment of an application from certain local
55 governments before considering the application, unless such a letter is not received
56 within 30 days of a request for the letter.
57 Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the governing body of the county, city or fire
58 protection district to state in the letter of acknowledgment whether the governing
59 body will require the lead participant to enter into an agreement to defray the cost
60 of local government services and infrastructure.
61 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an
62 abatement of all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local
63 government is authorized to impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic
64 development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly
65 authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement of any permitting fee or
66 licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 22, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT S.B. 69
SENATE BILL NO. 69–COMMITTEE ON
REVENUE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
(ON BEHALF OF STOREY COUNTY)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue and
Economic Development
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to economic
development. (BDR 32-369)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring an applicant for the issuance
of transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of
certain taxes for a project that is located in an economic
diversification district to enter into an agreement with
certain local governments to defray the cost of services
provided by the local governments under certain
circumstances; revising provisions governing applications
for the issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that satisfies
certain capital investment and other requirements;
authorizing a fire protection district to abate certain fees;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 applications for an abatement or partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance
3 of transferable tax credits submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project
4 that will make a capital investment in this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS
5 360.880-360.980) Additionally, existing law authorizes the governing body of a
6 county or city in which a qualified project is or is expected to be located to: (1)
7 create an economic diversification district that includes within its boundaries the
8 qualified project; and (2) pledge for certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and
9 use taxes imposed in the county or city on each participant in the qualified project,
10 other than any sales and use taxes for which an abatement is received.
11 (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2 and 6 of this bill require, as a condition of
-
*SB69_R2*

– 2 –
12 eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the abatement or partial abatement of
13 taxes for a project that is or will be located in an economic diversification district,
14 the lead participant to enter into an agreement with the governing body of the city,
15 county or fire protection district in which the project is located, if the governing
16 body so requires, to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the cost
17 of local governmental services and infrastructure to service the project. Sections 2
18 and 6: (1) provide that the city or county in which a project is located is the lead
19 negotiator for all such agreements; and (2) authorize a city, county or fire
20 protection district that is not the lead negotiator to enter into an interlocal
21 agreement with the lead negotiator. Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 make records, files and
22 communications exchanged between the lead participant and a county, city or fire
23 protection district for the purpose of entering into certain agreements confidential
24 and prohibit the disclosure of such records, files and communications except with
25 the consent of the lead participant. Section 10 of this bill provides that these
26 records, files and communications are not public records. Section 11 of this bill
27 makes a conforming change to reflect that the governing body of a county or city is
28 authorized to enter into agreements with owners of any interest in property for the
29 payment of amounts to defray the costs of local government services, in addition to
30 the agreement which the governing body of the county or city is required to enter
31 into with the lead participant pursuant to sections 2 and 6.
32 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial
33 abatement for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital
34 investment in this State of at least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the
35 project has entered into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for
36 the abatement, including the date on which the abatement becomes effective, which
37 must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the application and
38 not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the application.
39 (NRS 360.889) Section 2 limits the requirement to state the effective date of the
40 partial abatement in the agreement to partial abatements of property taxes and
41 requires the effective date of such an abatement, as established by the agreement, to
42 be not earlier than July 1 of the fiscal year in which the Office executes the
43 agreement. Section 6 adds a similar requirement regarding the effective date of an
44 abatement to applications for an abatement for a qualified project whose
45 participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at least $3.5 billion.
46 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of
47 an application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of
48 taxes for a project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to
49 send a notification containing certain information to each city, county and fire
50 protection district in which the project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize
51 the disclosure of certain confidential information in an application to an officer or
52 employee of a county, city or fire protection district who is subject to an agreement
53 prohibiting further disclosure of the information. Sections 3 and 7 require the
54 Office to receive a letter of acknowledgment of an application from certain local
55 governments before considering the application, unless such a letter is not received
56 within 30 days of a request for the letter.
57 Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the governing body of the county, city or fire
58 protection district to state in the letter of acknowledgment whether the governing
59 body will require the lead participant to enter into an agreement to defray the cost
60 of local government services and infrastructure.
61 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an
62 abatement of all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local
63 government is authorized to impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic
64 development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly
65 authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement of any permitting fee or
66 licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.
