EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; [revising provisions governing audits conducted by
the Department of Taxation of recipients of a partial abatement of
certain taxes imposed upon a new or expanded data center;] requiring
an applicant for the issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that is located in an economic
diversification district to enter into an agreement with certain local
governments to defray the cost of services provided by the local
governments [;] under certain circumstances; revising provisions
governing applications for the issuance of transferable tax credits and
the partial abatement of certain taxes for a project that satisfies certain
capital investment and other requirements; authorizing a fire protection
district to abate certain fees; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to grant a partial
2 abatement of property taxes, modified business taxes and sales and use taxes to a business that
3 locates or expands in this State and meets certain qualifications for the abatement. (NRS
4 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.890, 360.950) If the Office approves an application by a
5 business for such an abatement or partial abatement, the business is required to enter into an
6 agreement with the Office to allow the Department of Taxation to conduct audits of the
7 business to determine whether the business is in compliance with the requirements for the
8 abatement or partial abatement. (NRS 360.755) Section 1 of this bill requires an audit of a
9 data center that is approved for a partial abatement to include a determination of the colocated
10 businesses that have entered into contracts to use or occupy the data center and the taxable
11 personal property that is located at the data center. Section 1 further requires such information
12 to be kept confidential and not disclosed to any person other than an employee of the
13 Department, the county assessor or county treasurer to whom the Department is required to

Senate Amendment No. 362 to Senate Bill No. 69 Page 4
14 provide the information or an officer or employee of such a county assessor or county
15 treasurer.]
16 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve applications for
17 an abatement or partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits
18 submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project that will make a capital investment in
19 this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS 360.880-360.980) Additionally, existing law authorizes
20 the governing body of a county or city in which a qualified project is or is expected to be
21 located to: (1) create an economic diversification district that includes within its boundaries
22 the qualified project; and (2) pledge for certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and use
23 taxes imposed in the county or city on each participant in the qualified project, other than any
24 sales and use taxes for which an abatement is received. (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2
25 and 6 of this bill require, as a condition of eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the
26 abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a project that is or will be located in an economic
27 diversification district, the lead participant to enter into an agreement with the governing body
28 of the city , [or] county [and] or fire protection district in which the project is located , if the
29 governing body so requires, to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the
30 cost of local governmental services and infrastructure to service the project. Sections 2 [and] ,
31 3, 6 and 7 make records, files and communications exchanged between the lead participant
32 and a county, city or fire protection district for the purpose of entering into certain agreements
33 confidential and prohibit the disclosure of such records, files and communications except with
34 the consent of the lead participant. Section 10 of this bill provides that these records, files and
35 communications are not public records. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to
36 reflect that the governing body of a county or city is authorized to enter into agreements with
37 owners of any interest in property for the payment of amounts to defray the costs of local
38 government services, in addition to the agreement which the governing body of the county or
39 city is required to enter into with the lead participant pursuant to sections 2 and 6.
40 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial abatement
41 for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at
42 least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the project has entered into an agreement with the
43 Office establishing certain terms for the abatement, including the date on which the abatement
44 becomes effective, which must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the
45 application and not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the
46 application. (NRS 360.889) Section 2 limits the requirement to state the effective date of
47 the partial abatement in the agreement to partial abatements of property taxes and
48 requires the effective date of [the] such an abatement, as established by the agreement, to be
49 not earlier than [the date on] July 1 of the fiscal year in which the Office [approves the
50 application.] executes the agreement. Section 6 adds a similar requirement regarding the
51 effective date of an abatement to applications for an abatement for a qualified project whose
52 participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at least $3.5 billion.
53 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of an
54 application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a
55 project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to send a notification
56 containing certain information to each city, county and fire protection district in which the
57 project will be located. [Sections 3 and 7 require, for the limited purpose of considering and
58 taking action on such an application, certain temporary voting members to be appointed to the
59 Board of Economic Development by the governing bodies of the county, city and fire
60 protection district in which the project will be located.] Sections 3 and 7 authorize the
61 disclosure of certain confidential information in an application to an officer or employee of a
62 county, city or fire protection district who is subject to an agreement prohibiting further
63 disclosure of the information. [Finally, sections] Sections 3 and 7 require the Office to
64 receive a letter of acknowledgment of an application from certain local governments before
65 considering the application, unless such a letter is not received within 30 days of a request for
66 the letter.
67 [Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the Office to forward a copy of the certificate of
68 eligibility which identifies the estimated amount of transferrable tax credits available to the
69 governing body of the county or city in which the project is located.] Finally, sections 3 and
70 7 require the governing body of the county, city or fire protection district to state in the
71 letter of acknowledgment whether the governing body will require the lead participant

Senate Amendment No. 362 to Senate Bill No. 69 Page 5
72 to enter into an agreement to defray the cost of local government services and
73 infrastructure.
74 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an abatement of
75 all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local government is authorized to
76 impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980)
77 Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement
78 of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.

50 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
51 record that is not otherwise confidential.
52 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
53 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

Senate Amendment No. 362 to Senate Bill No. 69 Page 26
1 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
2 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
3 (a) The public record:
4 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
5 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
6 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
7 electronic medium would:
8 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
9 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
10 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
11 otherwise confidential.
12 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
13 custody or control of a public record:
14 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
15 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
16 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
17 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
18 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
19 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

26 to both, to defray, in whole or in part, the cost of local governmental services
27 during the term of the use of any money pledged pursuant to NRS 271B.070. Such
28 an agreement must specify the amount to be paid by the owner of the property
29 interest, which may be stated as a specified amount per year or as an amount based
30 upon any formula upon which the municipality and owner agree.
31 Sec. 12. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
32 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
33 the Legislature.
