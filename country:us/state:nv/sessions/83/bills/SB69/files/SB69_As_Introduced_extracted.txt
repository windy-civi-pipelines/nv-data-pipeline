EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing audits
conducted by the Department of Taxation of recipients of
a partial abatement of certain taxes imposed upon a new
or expanded data center; requiring an applicant for the
issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that is located in
an economic diversification district to enter into an
agreement with certain local governments to defray the
cost of services provided by the local governments;
revising provisions governing applications for the
issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that satisfies
certain capital investment and other requirements;
authorizing a fire protection district to abate certain fees;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to grant a partial
2 abatement of property taxes, modified business taxes and sales and use taxes to a
3 business that locates or expands in this State and meets certain qualifications for the
4 abatement. (NRS 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.890, 360.950) If the Office
5 approves an application by a business for such an abatement or partial abatement,
6 the business is required to enter into an agreement with the Office to allow the
7 Department of Taxation to conduct audits of the business to determine whether the
-
*SB69*
– 2 –
8 business is in compliance with the requirements for the abatement or partial
9 abatement. (NRS 360.755) Section 1 of this bill requires an audit of a data center
10 that is approved for a partial abatement to include a determination of the colocated
11 businesses that have entered into contracts to use or occupy the data center and the
12 taxable personal property that is located at the data center. Section 1 further
13 requires such information to be kept confidential and not disclosed to any person
14 other than an employee of the Department, the county assessor or county treasurer
15 to whom the Department is required to provide the information or an officer or
16 employee of such a county assessor or county treasurer.
17 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve applications for an abatement or
18 partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits
19 submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project that will make a capital
20 investment in this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS 360.880-360.980) Additionally,
21 existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a qualified
22 project is or is expected to be located to: (1) create an economic diversification
23 district that includes within its boundaries the qualified project; and (2) pledge for
24 certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and use taxes imposed in the county or
25 city on each participant in the qualified project, other than any sales and use taxes
26 for which an abatement is received. (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2 and 6 of
27 this bill require, as a condition of eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the
28 abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a project that is or will be located in an
29 economic diversification district, the lead participant to enter into an agreement
30 with the governing body of the city or county and fire protection district in which
31 the project is located to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the
32 cost of local governmental services and infrastructure to service the project.
33 Sections 2 and 6 make records, files and communications exchanged between the
34 lead participant and a county, city or fire protection district for the purpose of
35 entering into certain agreements confidential and prohibit the disclosure of such
36 records, files and communications except with the consent of the lead participant.
37 Section 10 of this bill provides that these records, files and communications are not
38 public records. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the
39 governing body of a county or city is authorized to enter into agreements with
40 owners of any interest in property for the payment of amounts to defray the costs of
41 local government services, in addition to the agreement which the governing body
42 of the county or city is required to enter into with the lead participant pursuant to
43 sections 2 and 6.
44 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial
45 abatement for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital
46 investment in this State of at least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the
47 project has entered into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for
48 the abatement, including the date on which the abatement becomes effective, which
49 must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the application and
50 not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the application.
51 (NRS 360.889) Section 2 requires the effective date of the abatement, as
52 established by the agreement, to be not earlier than the date on which the Office
53 approves the application. Section 6 adds a similar requirement regarding the
54 effective date of an abatement to applications for an abatement for a qualified
55 project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at
56 least $3.5 billion.
57 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of
58 an application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of
59 taxes for a project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to
60 send a notification containing certain information to each city, county and fire
61 protection district in which the project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 require, for
62 the limited purpose of considering and taking action on such an application, certain
-
*SB69*
– 3 –
63 temporary voting members to be appointed to the Board of Economic Development
64 by the governing bodies of the county, city and fire protection district in which the
65 project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize the disclosure of certain
66 confidential information in an application to an officer or employee of a county,
67 city or fire protection district who is subject to an agreement prohibiting further
68 disclosure of the information. Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the Office to receive
69 a letter of acknowledgment of an application from certain local governments before
70 considering the application, unless such a letter is not received within 30 days of a
71 request for the letter.
72 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the Office to forward a copy of the
73 certificate of eligibility which identifies the estimated amount of transferrable tax
74 credits available to the governing body of the county or city in which the project is
75 located.
76 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an
77 abatement of all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local
78 government is authorized to impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic
79 development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly
80 authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement of any permitting fee or
81 licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.

AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing audits
conducted by the Department of Taxation of recipients of
a partial abatement of certain taxes imposed upon a new
or expanded data center; requiring an applicant for the
issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that is located in
an economic diversification district to enter into an
agreement with certain local governments to defray the
cost of services provided by the local governments;
revising provisions governing applications for the
issuance of transferable tax credits and the partial
abatement of certain taxes for a project that satisfies
certain capital investment and other requirements;
authorizing a fire protection district to abate certain fees;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to grant a partial
2 abatement of property taxes, modified business taxes and sales and use taxes to a
3 business that locates or expands in this State and meets certain qualifications for the
4 abatement. (NRS 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.890, 360.950) If the Office
5 approves an application by a business for such an abatement or partial abatement,
6 the business is required to enter into an agreement with the Office to allow the
7 Department of Taxation to conduct audits of the business to determine whether the
-
*SB69*

– 2 –
8 business is in compliance with the requirements for the abatement or partial
9 abatement. (NRS 360.755) Section 1 of this bill requires an audit of a data center
10 that is approved for a partial abatement to include a determination of the colocated
11 businesses that have entered into contracts to use or occupy the data center and the
12 taxable personal property that is located at the data center. Section 1 further
13 requires such information to be kept confidential and not disclosed to any person
14 other than an employee of the Department, the county assessor or county treasurer
15 to whom the Department is required to provide the information or an officer or
16 employee of such a county assessor or county treasurer.
17 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve applications for an abatement or
18 partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits
19 submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project that will make a capital
20 investment in this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS 360.880-360.980) Additionally,
21 existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city in which a qualified
22 project is or is expected to be located to: (1) create an economic diversification
23 district that includes within its boundaries the qualified project; and (2) pledge for
24 certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and use taxes imposed in the county or
25 city on each participant in the qualified project, other than any sales and use taxes
26 for which an abatement is received. (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2 and 6 of
27 this bill require, as a condition of eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the
28 abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a project that is or will be located in an
29 economic diversification district, the lead participant to enter into an agreement
30 with the governing body of the city or county and fire protection district in which
31 the project is located to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the
32 cost of local governmental services and infrastructure to service the project.
33 Sections 2 and 6 make records, files and communications exchanged between the
34 lead participant and a county, city or fire protection district for the purpose of
35 entering into certain agreements confidential and prohibit the disclosure of such
36 records, files and communications except with the consent of the lead participant.
37 Section 10 of this bill provides that these records, files and communications are not
38 public records. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the
39 governing body of a county or city is authorized to enter into agreements with
40 owners of any interest in property for the payment of amounts to defray the costs of
41 local government services, in addition to the agreement which the governing body
42 of the county or city is required to enter into with the lead participant pursuant to
43 sections 2 and 6.
44 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial
45 abatement for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital
46 investment in this State of at least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the
47 project has entered into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for
48 the abatement, including the date on which the abatement becomes effective, which
49 must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the application and
50 not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the application.
51 (NRS 360.889) Section 2 requires the effective date of the abatement, as
52 established by the agreement, to be not earlier than the date on which the Office
53 approves the application. Section 6 adds a similar requirement regarding the
54 effective date of an abatement to applications for an abatement for a qualified
55 project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at
56 least $3.5 billion.
57 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of
58 an application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of
59 taxes for a project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to
60 send a notification containing certain information to each city, county and fire
61 protection district in which the project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 require, for
62 the limited purpose of considering and taking action on such an application, certain
-
*SB69*

– 3 –
63 temporary voting members to be appointed to the Board of Economic Development
64 by the governing bodies of the county, city and fire protection district in which the
65 project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize the disclosure of certain
66 confidential information in an application to an officer or employee of a county,
67 city or fire protection district who is subject to an agreement prohibiting further
68 disclosure of the information. Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the Office to receive
69 a letter of acknowledgment of an application from certain local governments before
70 considering the application, unless such a letter is not received within 30 days of a
71 request for the letter.
72 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the Office to forward a copy of the
73 certificate of eligibility which identifies the estimated amount of transferrable tax
74 credits available to the governing body of the county or city in which the project is
75 located.
76 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an
77 abatement of all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local
78 government is authorized to impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic
79 development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly
80 authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement of any permitting fee or
81 licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.
