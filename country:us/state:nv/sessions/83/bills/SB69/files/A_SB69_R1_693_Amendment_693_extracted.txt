~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring an applicant for the issuance of transferable
tax credits and the partial abatement of certain taxes for a project that is
located in an economic diversification district to enter into an
agreement with certain local governments to defray the cost of services
provided by the local governments under certain circumstances;
revising provisions governing applications for the issuance of
transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of certain taxes for a
project that satisfies certain capital investment and other requirements;
authorizing a fire protection district to abate certain fees; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve applications for
2 an abatement or partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits
3 submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project that will make a capital investment in
4 this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS 360.880-360.980) Additionally, existing law authorizes
5 the governing body of a county or city in which a qualified project is or is expected to be
6 located to: (1) create an economic diversification district that includes within its boundaries
7 the qualified project; and (2) pledge for certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and use
8 taxes imposed in the county or city on each participant in the qualified project, other than any
9 sales and use taxes for which an abatement is received. (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2
10 and 6 of this bill require, as a condition of eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the
11 abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a project that is or will be located in an economic
12 diversification district, the lead participant to enter into an agreement with the governing body
13 of the city, county or fire protection district in which the project is located, if the governing
14 body so requires, to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the cost of local
15 governmental services and infrastructure to service the project. Sections 2 and 6: (1) provide
16 that the city or county in which a project is located is the lead negotiator for all such
17 agreements; and (2) authorize a city, county or fire protection district that is not the lead
Assembly Amendment No. 693 to Senate Bill No. 69 First Reprint Page 4
18 negotiator to enter into an interlocal agreement with the lead negotiator. Sections 2, 3, 6
19 and 7 make records, files and communications exchanged between the lead participant and a
20 county, city or fire protection district for the purpose of entering into certain agreements
21 confidential and prohibit the disclosure of such records, files and communications except with
22 the consent of the lead participant. Section 10 of this bill provides that these records, files and
23 communications are not public records. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to
24 reflect that the governing body of a county or city is authorized to enter into agreements with
25 owners of any interest in property for the payment of amounts to defray the costs of local
26 government services, in addition to the agreement which the governing body of the county or
27 city is required to enter into with the lead participant pursuant to sections 2 and 6.
28 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial abatement
29 for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at
30 least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the project has entered into an agreement with the
31 Office establishing certain terms for the abatement, including the date on which the abatement
32 becomes effective, which must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the
33 application and not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the
34 application. (NRS 360.889) Section 2 limits the requirement to state the effective date of the
35 partial abatement in the agreement to partial abatements of property taxes and requires the
36 effective date of such an abatement, as established by the agreement, to be not earlier than
37 July 1 of the fiscal year in which the Office executes the agreement. Section 6 adds a similar
38 requirement regarding the effective date of an abatement to applications for an abatement for a
39 qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at least
40 $3.5 billion.
41 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of an
42 application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a
43 project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to send a notification
44 containing certain information to each city, county and fire protection district in which the
45 project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize the disclosure of certain confidential
46 information in an application to an officer or employee of a county, city or fire protection
47 district who is subject to an agreement prohibiting further disclosure of the information.
48 Sections 3 and 7 require the Office to receive a letter of acknowledgment of an application
49 from certain local governments before considering the application, unless such a letter is not
50 received within 30 days of a request for the letter.
51 Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the governing body of the county, city or fire protection
52 district to state in the letter of acknowledgment whether the governing body will require the
53 lead participant to enter into an agreement to defray the cost of local government services and
54 infrastructure.
55 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an abatement of
56 all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local government is authorized to
57 impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980)
58 Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement
59 of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.

REVENUE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
(ON BEHALF OF STOREY COUNTY)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Revenue and
Economic Development
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to economic development.
(BDR 32-369)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring an applicant for the issuance of transferable
tax credits and the partial abatement of certain taxes for a project that is
located in an economic diversification district to enter into an
agreement with certain local governments to defray the cost of services
provided by the local governments under certain circumstances;
revising provisions governing applications for the issuance of
transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of certain taxes for a
project that satisfies certain capital investment and other requirements;
authorizing a fire protection district to abate certain fees; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve applications for
2 an abatement or partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits
3 submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project that will make a capital investment in
4 this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS 360.880-360.980) Additionally, existing law authorizes
5 the governing body of a county or city in which a qualified project is or is expected to be
6 located to: (1) create an economic diversification district that includes within its boundaries
7 the qualified project; and (2) pledge for certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and use
8 taxes imposed in the county or city on each participant in the qualified project, other than any
9 sales and use taxes for which an abatement is received. (Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2
10 and 6 of this bill require, as a condition of eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the
11 abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a project that is or will be located in an economic
12 diversification district, the lead participant to enter into an agreement with the governing body
13 of the city, county or fire protection district in which the project is located, if the governing
14 body so requires, to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the cost of local
15 governmental services and infrastructure to service the project. Sections 2 and 6: (1) provide
16 that the city or county in which a project is located is the lead negotiator for all such
17 agreements; and (2) authorize a city, county or fire protection district that is not the lead

Assembly Amendment No. 693 to Senate Bill No. 69 First Reprint Page 4
18 negotiator to enter into an interlocal agreement with the lead negotiator. Sections 2, 3, 6
19 and 7 make records, files and communications exchanged between the lead participant and a
20 county, city or fire protection district for the purpose of entering into certain agreements
21 confidential and prohibit the disclosure of such records, files and communications except with
22 the consent of the lead participant. Section 10 of this bill provides that these records, files and
23 communications are not public records. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to
24 reflect that the governing body of a county or city is authorized to enter into agreements with
25 owners of any interest in property for the payment of amounts to defray the costs of local
26 government services, in addition to the agreement which the governing body of the county or
27 city is required to enter into with the lead participant pursuant to sections 2 and 6.
28 Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial abatement
29 for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at
30 least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the project has entered into an agreement with the
31 Office establishing certain terms for the abatement, including the date on which the abatement
32 becomes effective, which must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the
33 application and not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the
34 application. (NRS 360.889) Section 2 limits the requirement to state the effective date of the
35 partial abatement in the agreement to partial abatements of property taxes and requires the
36 effective date of such an abatement, as established by the agreement, to be not earlier than
37 July 1 of the fiscal year in which the Office executes the agreement. Section 6 adds a similar
38 requirement regarding the effective date of an abatement to applications for an abatement for a
39 qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at least
40 $3.5 billion.
41 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of an
42 application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of taxes for a
43 project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to send a notification
44 containing certain information to each city, county and fire protection district in which the
45 project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize the disclosure of certain confidential
46 information in an application to an officer or employee of a county, city or fire protection
47 district who is subject to an agreement prohibiting further disclosure of the information.
48 Sections 3 and 7 require the Office to receive a letter of acknowledgment of an application
49 from certain local governments before considering the application, unless such a letter is not
50 received within 30 days of a request for the letter.
51 Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the governing body of the county, city or fire protection
52 district to state in the letter of acknowledgment whether the governing body will require the
53 lead participant to enter into an agreement to defray the cost of local government services and
54 infrastructure.
55 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an abatement of
56 all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local government is authorized to
57 impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980)
58 Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement
59 of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.

5 of chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of
6 Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public
7 books and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during
8 office hours to inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
9 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
10 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with
11 copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to
12 the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does
13 not supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or
14 enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written
15 book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
16 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
17 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
18 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
19 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
20 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public

28 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
29 (a) The public record:
30 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
31 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
32 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
33 electronic medium would:
34 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
35 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
36 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
37 otherwise confidential.
38 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
39 custody or control of a public record:
40 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
41 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
42 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
43 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
44 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
45 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
