Senate Bill No. 69–Committee on
Revenue and Economic Development
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring an applicant for the issuance
of transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of certain
taxes for a project that is located in an economic
diversification district to enter into an agreement with certain
local governments to defray the cost of services provided by
the local governments under certain circumstances; revising
provisions governing applications for the issuance of
transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of certain
taxes for a project that satisfies certain capital investment and
other requirements; authorizing a fire protection district to
abate certain fees; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
applications for an abatement or partial abatement of certain taxes and the issuance
of transferable tax credits submitted by the lead participant in a qualified project
that will make a capital investment in this State of at least $1 billion. (NRS
360.880-360.980) Additionally, existing law authorizes the governing body of a
county or city in which a qualified project is or is expected to be located to: (1)
create an economic diversification district that includes within its boundaries the
qualified project; and (2) pledge for certain purposes the proceeds of all sales and
use taxes imposed in the county or city on each participant in the qualified project,
other than any sales and use taxes for which an abatement is received.
(Chapter 271B of NRS) Sections 2 and 6 of this bill require, as a condition of
eligibility for the transferable tax credits or the abatement or partial abatement of
taxes for a project that is or will be located in an economic diversification district,
the lead participant to enter into an agreement with the governing body of the city,
county or fire protection district in which the project is located, if the governing
body so requires, to require the lead participant to make payments to defray the cost
of local governmental services and infrastructure to service the project. Sections 2
and 6: (1) provide that the city or county in which a project is located is the lead
negotiator for all such agreements; and (2) authorize a city, county or fire
protection district that is not the lead negotiator to enter into an interlocal
agreement with the lead negotiator. Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 make records, files and
communications exchanged between the lead participant and a county, city or fire
protection district for the purpose of entering into certain agreements confidential
and prohibit the disclosure of such records, files and communications except with
the consent of the lead participant. Section 10 of this bill provides that these
records, files and communications are not public records. Section 11 of this bill
makes a conforming change to reflect that the governing body of a county or city is
authorized to enter into agreements with owners of any interest in property for the
payment of amounts to defray the costs of local government services, in addition to
the agreement which the governing body of the county or city is required to enter
into with the lead participant pursuant to sections 2 and 6.
Existing law prohibits the Office from approving an application for a partial
abatement for a qualified project whose participants intend to make a capital
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
investment in this State of at least $1 billion unless the lead participant of the
project has entered into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for
the abatement, including the date on which the abatement becomes effective, which
must not be earlier than the date on which the Office receives the application and
not later than 1 year after the date on which the Office approves the application.
(NRS 360.889) Section 2 limits the requirement to state the effective date of the
partial abatement in the agreement to partial abatements of property taxes and
requires the effective date of such an abatement, as established by the agreement, to
be not earlier than July 1 of the fiscal year in which the Office executes the
agreement. Section 6 adds a similar requirement regarding the effective date of an
abatement to applications for an abatement for a qualified project whose
participants intend to make a capital investment in this State of at least $3.5 billion.
Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require the Office, within 15 days after receipt of
an application for transferable tax credits or an abatement or partial abatement of
taxes for a project with a capital investment of at least $1 billion in this State, to
send a notification containing certain information to each city, county and fire
protection district in which the project will be located. Sections 3 and 7 authorize
the disclosure of certain confidential information in an application to an officer or
employee of a county, city or fire protection district who is subject to an agreement
prohibiting further disclosure of the information. Sections 3 and 7 require the
Office to receive a letter of acknowledgment of an application from certain local
governments before considering the application, unless such a letter is not received
within 30 days of a request for the letter.
Finally, sections 3 and 7 require the governing body of the county, city or fire
protection district to state in the letter of acknowledgment whether the governing
body will require the lead participant to enter into an agreement to defray the cost
of local government services and infrastructure.
Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to grant an
abatement of all or part of any permitting fee or licensing fee which the local
government is authorized to impose, for the purpose of encouraging local economic
development. (NRS 360.896, 360.980) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill similarly
authorize a fire protection district to grant an abatement of any permitting fee or
licensing fee which the fire protection district is authorized to impose.

5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
