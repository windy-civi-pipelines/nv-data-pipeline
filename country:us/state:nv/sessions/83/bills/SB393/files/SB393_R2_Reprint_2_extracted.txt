3 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
4 by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
5 Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
6 Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
-
*SB393_R2*
– 2 –
7 program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
13 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
14 lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
15 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the
16 program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor
17 Park neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on
18 December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the
19 owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or
20 is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on that vacant
21 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
22 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to
23 the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the
24 Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-
25 family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus,
26 eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under penalty of
27 perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to establish inheritance of the
28 property; (4) provides that until June 30, 2057, a single-family residence acquired
29 pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement of a certain amount of property taxes
30 levied on the single-family residence; (5) provides an exemption from taxes on the
31 transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant
32 to the Act; (6) requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family
33 residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged to perform certain additional work
34 related to the project, without formal bidding under existing state law, including,
35 without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for
36 the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
37 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of
38 certain bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those
39 proceeds to the Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the
40 requirement for the Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of
41 single-family residences in the Windsor Park neighborhood from certain
42 Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to the Division and,
43 instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
44 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
45 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General
46 Fund for the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium
47 rather than at the end of the 2023-2025 biennium.
48 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund
49 to the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

7 the past and present residents of the Windsor Park

10 Park neighborhood. For the purposes of creating such a
11 public park, the governmental agency, nonprofit

13 pursuant to subsection 3 must be engaged under an
14 agreement, which must be separate from any agreement
15 entered into pursuant to subsection 6, for any additional
16 work necessary to develop and construct such a park,
17 including, without limitation, the demolition of any
18 residences transferred pursuant to this section. Any
19 agreement for the demolition of the residences pursuant to
20 this subsection is exempt from the provisions of state law
21 governing the award of a contract by governmental entities,

3 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
4 by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
5 Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
6 Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
-
*SB393_R2*

– 2 –
7 program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
13 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
14 lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
15 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the
16 program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor
17 Park neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on
18 December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the
19 owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or
20 is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on that vacant
21 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
22 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to
23 the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the
24 Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-
25 family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus,
26 eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under penalty of
27 perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to establish inheritance of the
28 property; (4) provides that until June 30, 2057, a single-family residence acquired
29 pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement of a certain amount of property taxes
30 levied on the single-family residence; (5) provides an exemption from taxes on the
31 transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant
32 to the Act; (6) requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family
33 residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged to perform certain additional work
34 related to the project, without formal bidding under existing state law, including,
35 without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for
36 the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
37 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of
38 certain bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those
39 proceeds to the Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the
40 requirement for the Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of
41 single-family residences in the Windsor Park neighborhood from certain
42 Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to the Division and,
43 instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
44 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
45 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General
46 Fund for the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium
47 rather than at the end of the 2023-2025 biennium.
48 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund
49 to the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

34 percent must be assigned to an applicant that is a business in

7 the past and present residents of the Windsor Park

10 Park neighborhood. For the purposes of creating such a
11 public park, the governmental agency, nonprofit

13 pursuant to subsection 3 must be engaged under an
14 agreement, which must be separate from any agreement
15 entered into pursuant to subsection 6, for any additional
16 work necessary to develop and construct such a park,
17 including, without limitation, the demolition of any
18 residences transferred pursuant to this section. Any
19 agreement for the demolition of the residences pursuant to
20 this subsection is exempt from the provisions of state law
21 governing the award of a contract by governmental entities,
