Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which establishes a
2 program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park neighborhood of the City
3 of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by the sinking of the ground
4 beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act,
5 the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and
6 administer a program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
7 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the
8 Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance with the Act.
9 (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540) This bill makes revisions to
10 the Act.
11 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood for the
12 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
13 to participate in the program.
14 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the program, an
15 owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood must have
Assembly Amendment No. 967 to Senate Bill No. 393 Second Reprint Page 4
16 owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2)
17 authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and
18 who was the owner, or is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on
19 that vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
20 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the
21 Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park
22 neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant
23 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by
24 executing an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to
25 establish inheritance of the property; (4) provides that until July 1, 2057, a single-family
26 residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement of a certain amount of
27 property taxes levied on the single-family residence; (5) provides an exemption from taxes on
28 the transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the
29 Act; (6) requires the Housing Division to file for record a certificate creating a lien on the
30 single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act to secure repayment of the amount
31 of assistance provided by the Housing Division to pay off any existing mortgage on the
32 single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood if the new residence is sold
33 within 5 years after the time of the filing of the certificate; (7) limits the amount of
34 assistance provided to pay off a mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor
35 Park neighborhood to the pay off amount on May 25, 2025; and (8) requires the entity
36 selected to develop and construct a single-family residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged
37 to perform certain additional work related to the project, without formal bidding under
38 existing state law, including, without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park
39 neighborhood for the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
40 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of certain
41 bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those proceeds to the
42 Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the requirement for the Division to
43 pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the Windsor
44 Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to
45 the Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
46 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
47 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General Fund for
48 the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of
49 the 2023-2025 biennium.
50 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund to the
51 Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

23 subsection 1 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood who
24 owned a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood on December 31,
25 2023, to exchange the vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a

Assembly Amendment No. 967 to Senate Bill No. 393 Second Reprint Page 7

32 that was acquired pursuant to subsection 7, as determined pursuant to
33 NRS 361.225 and 361.227, on the date on which that single-family
34 residence was acquired, and the taxes levied on the single-family

40 on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to subsection 7.
41 9. The taxes imposed pursuant to chapter 375 of NRS do not apply
42 to any transfer of property pursuant to the provisions of this Act by the

45 such an entity, or a transfer of property pursuant to the provision of this
46 Act to or from a resident of the Windsor Park neighborhood, or the owner
47 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, who is exchanging a
48 single-family residence or a vacant lot pursuant to this Act.
49 10. The power, sewer and other connection fees imposed by the City
50 on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood must be
51 transferred to a single-family residence acquired pursuant to this section as

Assembly Amendment No. 967 to Senate Bill No. 393 Second Reprint Page 8

3 public park to memorialize the past and present residents of the Windsor
4 Park neighborhood [.] , which must be available for use, without charge,
5 to schools and churches that serve the Windsor Park neighborhood. For
6 the purposes of creating such a public park, the governmental agency,
7 nonprofit corporation or other entity selected by the Housing Division
8 pursuant to subsection 3 must be engaged under an agreement, which

13 the residences pursuant to this subsection is exempt from the provisions
14 of state law governing the award of a contract by governmental entities,
15 and any payments pursuant to such an agreement must be paid entirely
16 from money appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose. After the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which establishes a
2 program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park neighborhood of the City
3 of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by the sinking of the ground
4 beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act,
5 the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and
6 administer a program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
7 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the
8 Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance with the Act.
9 (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540) This bill makes revisions to
10 the Act.
11 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood for the
12 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
13 to participate in the program.
14 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the program, an
15 owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood must have

Assembly Amendment No. 967 to Senate Bill No. 393 Second Reprint Page 4
16 owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2)
17 authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and
18 who was the owner, or is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on
19 that vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
20 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the
21 Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park
22 neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant
23 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by
24 executing an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to
25 establish inheritance of the property; (4) provides that until July 1, 2057, a single-family
26 residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement of a certain amount of
27 property taxes levied on the single-family residence; (5) provides an exemption from taxes on
28 the transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the
29 Act; (6) requires the Housing Division to file for record a certificate creating a lien on the
30 single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act to secure repayment of the amount
31 of assistance provided by the Housing Division to pay off any existing mortgage on the
32 single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood if the new residence is sold
33 within 5 years after the time of the filing of the certificate; (7) limits the amount of
34 assistance provided to pay off a mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor
35 Park neighborhood to the pay off amount on May 25, 2025; and (8) requires the entity
36 selected to develop and construct a single-family residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged
37 to perform certain additional work related to the project, without formal bidding under
38 existing state law, including, without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park
39 neighborhood for the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
40 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of certain
41 bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those proceeds to the
42 Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the requirement for the Division to
43 pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the Windsor
44 Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to
45 the Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
46 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
47 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General Fund for
48 the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of
49 the 2023-2025 biennium.
50 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund to the
51 Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

Assembly Amendment No. 967 to Senate Bill No. 393 Second Reprint Page 7

29 8. Until July 1, 2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to

32 that was acquired pursuant to subsection 7, as determined pursuant to
33 NRS 361.225 and 361.227, on the date on which that single-family
34 residence was acquired, and the taxes levied on the single-family
35 residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood that was exchanged, as

39 apply to the calculation of the taxes on the single-family residence levied
40 on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to subsection 7.
41 9. The taxes imposed pursuant to chapter 375 of NRS do not apply
42 to any transfer of property pursuant to the provisions of this Act by the
43 governmental agency, nonprofit corporation or other entity that has

45 such an entity, or a transfer of property pursuant to the provision of this
46 Act to or from a resident of the Windsor Park neighborhood, or the owner
47 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, who is exchanging a
48 single-family residence or a vacant lot pursuant to this Act.
49 10. The power, sewer and other connection fees imposed by the City
50 on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood must be
51 transferred to a single-family residence acquired pursuant to this section as
52 the power, sewer and the connections fees to be imposed on that single-
53 family residence.

Assembly Amendment No. 967 to Senate Bill No. 393 Second Reprint Page 8
1 [8.] 11. Any property in the Windsor Park neighborhood that is
2 exchanged pursuant to this section must be used only for the purposes of a
3 public park to memorialize the past and present residents of the Windsor
4 Park neighborhood [.] , which must be available for use, without charge,
5 to schools and churches that serve the Windsor Park neighborhood. For
6 the purposes of creating such a public park, the governmental agency,
7 nonprofit corporation or other entity selected by the Housing Division
8 pursuant to subsection 3 must be engaged under an agreement, which
9 must be separate from any agreement entered into pursuant to subsection
10 6, for any additional work necessary to develop and construct such a

12 transferred pursuant to this section. Any agreement for the demolition of
13 the residences pursuant to this subsection is exempt from the provisions
14 of state law governing the award of a contract by governmental entities,
15 and any payments pursuant to such an agreement must be paid entirely
16 from money appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose. After the
