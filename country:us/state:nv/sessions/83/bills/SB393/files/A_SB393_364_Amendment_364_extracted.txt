Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which establishes a
2 program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park neighborhood of the City
3 of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by the sinking of the ground
4 beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act,
5 the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and
6 administer a program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
7 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the
8 Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance with the Act.
9 (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540) This bill makes revisions to
10 the Act.
11 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood for the
12 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
13 to participate in the program. Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to
14 participate in the program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor
15 Park neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31,
Senate Amendment No. 364 to Senate Bill No. 393 Page 4
16 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes [an] a person who is the owner of a vacant lot
17 in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant of the
18 former owner, of a single-family residence on that vacant lot in the Windsor Park
19 neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant
20 lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3)
21 authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she
22 is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood
23 and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under penalty of
24 perjury, [that he or she acquired title to the single-family residence or vacant lot from a
25 deceased relative by operation of law;] and presenting certain other documentation to
26 establish inheritance of the property; and (4) provides that for the purposes of determining
27 the amount of property taxes levied on single-family residences acquired pursuant to the Act,
28 the assessed value of such residences must be determined as if such residences were not new
29 improvements. Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds
30 of certain bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those proceeds
31 to the Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the requirement for the
32 Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
33 Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds
34 transferred to the Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to
35 pay relocation expenses for [those persons.] certain owners and tenants. Section 4 of this
36 bill provides that money appropriated from the State General Fund for the purposes of the Act
37 reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of the 2023-2025
38 biennium.

1 subsection 1 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood who
2 owned a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood on December 31,

23 [6.] 7. [Upon acquisition of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park
24 neighborhood pursuant to this section, the owner of a vacant lot in the
25 Windsor Park neighborhood who owned that vacant lot on December 31,
26 2023, may exchange the vacant lot for a vacant lot acquired pursuant to
27 this section with at least the same number of acres as the vacant lot being
28 exchanged.] Upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for each
29 single-family residence constructed pursuant to this section, the owner of a
30 single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood who owns that
31 residence on [July 1,] December 31, 2023, may exchange that single-family
32 residence for a single-family residence which was constructed pursuant to
33 this section and which has at least the same amount of square footage as the
34 residence being exchanged. If the single-family residence being exchanged

1 acquired pursuant to subsection [6,] 7, as determined pursuant to NRS

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which establishes a
2 program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park neighborhood of the City
3 of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by the sinking of the ground
4 beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act,
5 the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and
6 administer a program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
7 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the
8 Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance with the Act.
9 (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540) This bill makes revisions to
10 the Act.
11 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood for the
12 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
13 to participate in the program. Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to
14 participate in the program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor
15 Park neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31,

Senate Amendment No. 364 to Senate Bill No. 393 Page 4
16 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes [an] a person who is the owner of a vacant lot
17 in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant of the
18 former owner, of a single-family residence on that vacant lot in the Windsor Park
19 neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant
20 lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3)
21 authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she
22 is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood
23 and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under penalty of
24 perjury, [that he or she acquired title to the single-family residence or vacant lot from a
25 deceased relative by operation of law;] and presenting certain other documentation to
26 establish inheritance of the property; and (4) provides that for the purposes of determining
27 the amount of property taxes levied on single-family residences acquired pursuant to the Act,
28 the assessed value of such residences must be determined as if such residences were not new
29 improvements. Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds
30 of certain bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those proceeds
31 to the Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the requirement for the
32 Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
33 Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds
34 transferred to the Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to
35 pay relocation expenses for [those persons.] certain owners and tenants. Section 4 of this
36 bill provides that money appropriated from the State General Fund for the purposes of the Act
37 reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of the 2023-2025
38 biennium.

9 family residence.
10 [8. 9.] 10. Any property in the Windsor Park neighborhood that is
11 exchanged pursuant to this section must be used only for the purposes of a
