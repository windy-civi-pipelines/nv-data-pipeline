1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which establishes a
2 program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park neighborhood of the City
3 of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by the sinking of the ground
4 beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act,
5 the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and
6 administer a program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
7 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the
8 Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance with the Act.
9 (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540) This bill makes revisions to
10 the Act.

12 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
13 to participate in the program.
14 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the program, an
15 owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood must have
16 owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2)
17 authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and
18 who was the owner, or is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on
19 that vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
20 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the
21 Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park
22 neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant
23 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by
24 executing an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to
25 establish inheritance of the property; [and] (4) provides that [for the purposes of determining
26 the] until June 30, 2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled
27 to an abatement of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family
28 [residences acquired pursuant to the Act, the assessed value of such residences must be
29 determined as if such residences were not new improvements.] residence; (5) provides an
30 exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-

34 including, without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood
35 for the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
36 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of certain
37 bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those proceeds to the
38 Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the requirement for the Division to
39 pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the Windsor
40 Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to
41 the Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
42 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
43 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General Fund for
44 the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of
45 the 2023-2025 biennium.
46 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund to the
47 Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

48 nonprofit corporation or other entity engaged in the development of

7 5 percent must be assigned to an applicant that is a business in which at
8 least 50 percent of the interest is owned by a resident or former resident of
9 the Windsor Park neighborhood. Any restriction on the price which the
10 Housing Division may pay to acquire a parcel of real property does not
11 apply to an acquisition pursuant to this section.
12 [3.] 4. The number of single-family residences constructed pursuant
13 to this section must be sufficient in number to enable each [household
14 residing in] owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
15 neighborhood on [July 1,] December 31, 2023, to obtain such a single-
16 family residence, and the single-family residences constructed pursuant to

18 family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood on [July 1,] December
19 31, 2023, to obtain a single-family residence with at least the same amount

23 subsection 1 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood who
24 owned a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood on December 31,
25 2023, to exchange the vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a

32 within the Windsor Park neighborhood when such access is necessary to
33 carry out the provisions of this section, and the City shall not unreasonably
34 withhold such access.
35 [5.] 6. The governmental entity, nonprofit corporation or other entity
36 selected by the Housing Division pursuant to subsection [2,] 3, the City and

Senate Amendment No. 810 to Senate Bill No. 393 First Reprint Page 7
1 (a) Encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust, the single-family
2 residence may not be exchanged unless the existing mortgage or deed of
3 trust is paid in full. The Housing Division shall provide assistance to

13 transaction that is exempt from the taxes imposed by chapter 375 of NRS
14 pursuant to NRS 375.090.
15 [7.] 8. Until July 1, 2057, a single-family residence acquired
16 pursuant to subsection 7 is entitled to an exemption from property taxes
17 that is equal to the difference between the [assessed value of] taxes levied
18 on the single-family residence [in the Windsor Park neighborhood] that
19 was acquired pursuant to subsection 7, as determined pursuant to NRS
20 361.225 and 361.227, on the date on which that single-family residence
21 was acquired, and the [assessed value that] taxes levied on the single-
22 family residence [would have had if it were not considered a new
23 improvement on the date on which the residence was acquired.] in the
24 Windsor Park neighborhood that was exchanged, as determined pursuant
25 to NRS 361.225 and 361.227, for the fiscal year in which the single-
26 family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood was exchanged. The
27 provisions of NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 and 361.4724 apply to the
28 calculation of the taxes on the single-family residence levied on the
29 single-family residence acquired pursuant to subsection 7.
30 9. The taxes imposed pursuant to chapter 375 of NRS do not apply
31 to any transfer of property pursuant to the provisions of this Act by the
32 governmental agency, nonprofit corporation or other entity that has
33 entered into an agreement pursuant to subsection 6, or an affiliate of
34 such an entity, or a transfer of property pursuant to the provision of this
35 Act to or from a resident of the Windsor Park neighborhood, or the owner
36 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, who is exchanging a
37 single-family residence or a vacant lot pursuant to this Act.
38 10. The power, sewer and other connection fees imposed by the City
39 on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood must be
40 transferred to a single-family residence acquired pursuant to this section as
41 the power, sewer and the connections fees to be imposed on that single-
42 family residence.
43 [8. 10.] 11. Any property in the Windsor Park neighborhood that is
44 exchanged pursuant to this section must be used only for the purposes of a
45 public park to memorialize the past and present residents of the Windsor
46 Park neighborhood [.] , which must be available for use, without charge,
47 to schools and churches that serve the Windsor Park neighborhood. For
48 the purposes of creating such a public park, the governmental agency,
49 nonprofit corporation or other entity selected by the Housing Division
50 pursuant to subsection 3 [shall demolish] must be engaged under an
51 agreement, which must be separate from any agreement entered into
52 pursuant to subsection 6, for any additional work necessary to develop
53 and construct such a park, including, without limitation, the demolition
Senate Amendment No. 810 to Senate Bill No. 393 First Reprint Page 8
1 of any residences transferred pursuant to this section. Any agreement for
2 the demolition of the residences pursuant to this subsection is exempt
3 from the provisions of state law governing the award of a contract by
4 governmental entities, and any payments pursuant to such an agreement
5 must be paid entirely from money appropriated by the Legislature for that
6 purpose. After the demolition of the residences pursuant to this
7 subsection, the City shall maintain the property as a public park for the
8 purposes described in this subsection.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which establishes a
2 program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park neighborhood of the City
3 of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by the sinking of the ground
4 beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act,
5 the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and
6 administer a program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
7 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the
8 Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance with the Act.
9 (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540) This bill makes revisions to
10 the Act.

11 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood for the
12 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
13 to participate in the program.
14 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the program, an
15 owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood must have
16 owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2)
17 authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and
18 who was the owner, or is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on
19 that vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
20 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the
21 Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park
22 neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant
23 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by
24 executing an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to
25 establish inheritance of the property; [and] (4) provides that [for the purposes of determining
26 the] until June 30, 2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled
27 to an abatement of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family
28 [residences acquired pursuant to the Act, the assessed value of such residences must be
29 determined as if such residences were not new improvements.] residence; (5) provides an
30 exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-
31 family residence pursuant to the Act; (6) requires the entity selected to develop and

34 including, without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood
35 for the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
36 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of certain
37 bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those proceeds to the
38 Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the requirement for the Division to
39 pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the Windsor
40 Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to
41 the Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
42 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
43 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General Fund for
44 the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of
45 the 2023-2025 biennium.
46 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund to the
47 Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

48 nonprofit corporation or other entity engaged in the development of
49 affordable housing to develop single-family residences on vacant land

1 [5,] 6, contract with qualified professionals for a study of vacant land
2 adjacent to the Windsor Park neighborhood that could be acquired to ensure
3 that such land will not subside, acquire vacant land adjacent to the Windsor
4 Park neighborhood if the study finds that such land will not subside and
5 enter into contracts to develop and construct single-family residences on
6 that land. In awarding such contracts, a preference with a relative weight of
7 5 percent must be assigned to an applicant that is a business in which at
8 least 50 percent of the interest is owned by a resident or former resident of
9 the Windsor Park neighborhood. Any restriction on the price which the
10 Housing Division may pay to acquire a parcel of real property does not
11 apply to an acquisition pursuant to this section.
12 [3.] 4. The number of single-family residences constructed pursuant
13 to this section must be sufficient in number to enable each [household
14 residing in] owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
15 neighborhood on [July 1,] December 31, 2023, to obtain such a single-
16 family residence, and the single-family residences constructed pursuant to

18 family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood on [July 1,] December

23 subsection 1 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood who
24 owned a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood on December 31,
25 2023, to exchange the vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a

32 within the Windsor Park neighborhood when such access is necessary to
33 carry out the provisions of this section, and the City shall not unreasonably
34 withhold such access.
35 [5.] 6. The governmental entity, nonprofit corporation or other entity
36 selected by the Housing Division pursuant to subsection [2,] 3, the City and

49 residence for a single-family residence which was constructed pursuant to

Senate Amendment No. 810 to Senate Bill No. 393 First Reprint Page 7
1 (a) Encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust, the single-family
2 residence may not be exchanged unless the existing mortgage or deed of
3 trust is paid in full. The Housing Division shall provide assistance to

10  Any single-family residence acquired pursuant to this subsection may

13 transaction that is exempt from the taxes imposed by chapter 375 of NRS
14 pursuant to NRS 375.090.
15 [7.] 8. Until July 1, 2057, a single-family residence acquired
16 pursuant to subsection 7 is entitled to an exemption from property taxes
17 that is equal to the difference between the [assessed value of] taxes levied
18 on the single-family residence [in the Windsor Park neighborhood] that
19 was acquired pursuant to subsection 7, as determined pursuant to NRS
20 361.225 and 361.227, on the date on which that single-family residence
21 was acquired, and the [assessed value that] taxes levied on the single-
22 family residence [would have had if it were not considered a new
23 improvement on the date on which the residence was acquired.] in the
24 Windsor Park neighborhood that was exchanged, as determined pursuant
25 to NRS 361.225 and 361.227, for the fiscal year in which the single-
26 family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood was exchanged. The
27 provisions of NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 and 361.4724 apply to the
28 calculation of the taxes on the single-family residence levied on the
29 single-family residence acquired pursuant to subsection 7.
30 9. The taxes imposed pursuant to chapter 375 of NRS do not apply
31 to any transfer of property pursuant to the provisions of this Act by the
32 governmental agency, nonprofit corporation or other entity that has
33 entered into an agreement pursuant to subsection 6, or an affiliate of
34 such an entity, or a transfer of property pursuant to the provision of this
35 Act to or from a resident of the Windsor Park neighborhood, or the owner
36 of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, who is exchanging a
37 single-family residence or a vacant lot pursuant to this Act.
38 10. The power, sewer and other connection fees imposed by the City
39 on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood must be
40 transferred to a single-family residence acquired pursuant to this section as
41 the power, sewer and the connections fees to be imposed on that single-
42 family residence.
43 [8. 10.] 11. Any property in the Windsor Park neighborhood that is
44 exchanged pursuant to this section must be used only for the purposes of a
45 public park to memorialize the past and present residents of the Windsor
46 Park neighborhood [.] , which must be available for use, without charge,
47 to schools and churches that serve the Windsor Park neighborhood. For
48 the purposes of creating such a public park, the governmental agency,
49 nonprofit corporation or other entity selected by the Housing Division
50 pursuant to subsection 3 [shall demolish] must be engaged under an
51 agreement, which must be separate from any agreement entered into
52 pursuant to subsection 6, for any additional work necessary to develop
53 and construct such a park, including, without limitation, the demolition

Senate Amendment No. 810 to Senate Bill No. 393 First Reprint Page 8
1 of any residences transferred pursuant to this section. Any agreement for
2 the demolition of the residences pursuant to this subsection is exempt
3 from the provisions of state law governing the award of a contract by
4 governmental entities, and any payments pursuant to such an agreement
5 must be paid entirely from money appropriated by the Legislature for that
6 purpose. After the demolition of the residences pursuant to this
7 subsection, the City shall maintain the property as a public park for the
8 purposes described in this subsection.
9 Sec. 3. Section 9.3 of the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, being
10 chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3542, is hereby amended to read as
