Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
2 establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
3 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
4 by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
5 Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
6 Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
-
*SB393*
– 2 –
7 program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
13 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
14 lots who are eligible to participate in the program. Section 2 of this bill: (1)
15 requires that to be eligible to participate in the program, an owner of a single-family
16 residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood must have owned that
17 single-family residence or lot on December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2)
18 authorizes an owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate
19 in the program by exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as
20 near as reasonably practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a
21 person who resides in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is
22 the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park
23 neighborhood and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by executing an
24 affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that he or she acquired title to the single-family
25 residence or vacant lot from a deceased relative by operation of law; and (4)
26 provides that for the purposes of determining the amount of property taxes levied
27 on single-family residences acquired pursuant to the Act, the assessed value of such
28 residences must be determined as if such residences were not new improvements.
29 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of
30 certain bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those
31 proceeds to the Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the
32 requirement for the Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of
33 single-family residences in the Windsor Park neighborhood from certain
34 Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to the Division and,
35 instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
36 expenses for those persons. Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated
37 from the State General Fund for the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the
38 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of the 2023-2025 biennium.

11  For the purposes of the program established pursuant to

5 least the same amount of square footage as the residence
