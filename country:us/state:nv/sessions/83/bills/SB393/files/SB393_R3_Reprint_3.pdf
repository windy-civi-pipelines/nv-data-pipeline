8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
13 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
14 lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
15 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the
16 program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor
17 Park neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on
18 December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the
19 owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or
20 is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence on that vacant
21 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging
22 the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to
23 the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the
24 Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a single-
25 family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus,
26 eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under penalty of
27 perjury, and presenting certain other documentation to establish inheritance of the
28 property; (4) provides that until July 1, 2057, a single-family residence acquired
29 pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement of a certain amount of property taxes
30 levied on the single-family residence; (5) provides an exemption from taxes on the
31 transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant
32 to the Act; (6) requires the Housing Division to file for record a certificate creating
33 a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act to secure
34 repayment of the amount of assistance provided by the Housing Division to pay off
35 any existing mortgage on the single-family residence in the Windsor Park
36 neighborhood if the new residence is sold within 5 years after the time of the filing
37 of the certificate; (7) limits the amount of assistance provided to pay off a mortgage
38 on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the pay off
39 amount on May 25, 2025; and (8) requires the entity selected to develop and
40 construct a single-family residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged to perform
41 certain additional work related to the project, without formal bidding under existing
42 state law, including, without limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park
43 neighborhood for the purposes of creating the park required under the Act.
44 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of
45 certain bonds to the Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those
46 proceeds to the Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the
47 requirement for the Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners of
48 single-family residences in the Windsor Park neighborhood from certain
49 Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to the Division and,
50 instead, authorizes those funds to be used by the Division to pay relocation
51 expenses for certain owners and tenants.
52 Section 4 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General
53 Fund for the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium
54 rather than at the end of the 2023-2025 biennium.
55 Section 4.5 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund
56 to the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.
