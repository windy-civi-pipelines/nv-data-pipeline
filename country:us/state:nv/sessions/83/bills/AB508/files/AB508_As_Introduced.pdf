and recommendations for the proposed executive budget

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before July 1 of each even-numbered
2 year, to impanel an Economic Forum consisting of economic and financial experts
3 appointed by the Governor to provide an estimate of the revenue that will be
4 collected by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the subsequent biennium
5 and to make such additional projections for economic indicators as the Economic
6 Forum deems necessary to ensure that this estimate is accurate. (NRS 353.226,
7 353.228) Existing law creates the State Education Fund for the purpose of
8 supporting the operation of the public schools in this State and requires certain
9 revenues of the State be deposited in the Fund. (NRS 387.1212) Section 1 of this
10 bill requires the Economic Forum to provide, in addition to an estimate of general,
11 unrestricted revenues, an estimate of the revenue that will be collected by the State
12 in the subsequent biennium that is required to be deposited for credit to the State
13 Education Fund.
14 Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to ensure that
15 money in the State General Fund is reserved in the proposed executive budget for
16 transfer to the State Education Fund in an amount that equals the amount
-
*AB508*

– 2 –
17 transferred in the immediately preceding biennium: (1) plus the greater of the rate
18 of increase in revenue collected for general, unrestricted uses as projected by the
19 Economic Forum or the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in
20 the public schools in this State in the immediately preceding biennium; or (2)
21 decreased by an amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue
22 collected by the State as projected by the Economic Forum. (NRS 387.12455)
23 Section 4 of this bill requires the amount reserved in the proposed executive budget
24 for transfer to the State Education Fund, if the Economic Forum projects an
25 increase in State revenue, to be the amount transferred during the immediately
26 preceding biennium plus the rate of increase in revenue collected for general,
27 unrestricted uses as projected by the Economic Forum, without taking into
28 consideration the combined rate of inflation and growth of enrollment in public
29 schools. Section 4 also no longer requires the Governor to consider projected
30 growth of enrollment in public schools when recommending statewide base per
31 pupil funding.
32 Existing law provides that if the final computation of apportionment for any
33 school district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils
34 exceeds the actual amount paid to that entity during the school year, the additional
35 amount due to the entity is required to be paid before September 1. If the final
36 computation of apportionment for any school district, charter school or university
37 school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than the actual amount paid to the entity
38 during the school year, the entity is required to pay the difference to the State
39 Education Fund before September 25. (NRS 387.1243) Section 3 of this bill
40 changes the date for such a payment to the State Education Fund by a school
41 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils from before
42 September 25 to before September 1.
43 Existing law imposes an excise tax on: (1) the first wholesale sale in this State
44 of cannabis by a medical cannabis cultivation facility or an adult-use cannabis
45 cultivation facility to another cannabis establishment; and (2) each retail sale in this
46 State of cannabis or cannabis products by an adult-use cannabis retail store or
47 cannabis consumption lounge. Existing law requires the revenues collected from
48 the excise tax on wholesale sales of cannabis to first be distributed to the Cannabis
49 Compliance Board and to local governments to pay the costs of the Board and local
50 governments to carry out the provisions governing the sale and taxation of cannabis
51 and cannabis products. Any amount of revenue remaining after these distributions
52 is required to be deposited in the State Education Fund. Although existing law caps
53 the amount of revenue from wholesale sales which is authorized to be used to
54 pay the costs of local governments at $5,000,000, existing law does not place a
55 limit on the costs of the Board which are authorized to be reimbursed from such
56 revenues. (NRS 372A.290) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement to use
57 revenue from the tax on wholesale sales of cannabis to pay the costs of the Board,
58 but retains the requirement for the Board to transfer $5,000,000 to local
59 governments for their costs. Section 5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the
60 Board to pay the costs of the Board to carry out certain provisions governing the
61 regulation of cannabis and cannabis products.

24 for the purpose of establishing budgetary estimates for expenditures

26 Budget Act, the Governor shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that
27 an amount of money in the State General Fund is reserved in the
28 proposed executive budget for transfer to the State Education Fund
29 which is sufficient to fully fund:
30 (a) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
31 the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase , [by a rate that
32 is greater than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of
33 enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
34 preceding biennium,] an amount of money in the State General Fund
35 for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
36 which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State
37 Education Fund from the State General Fund for the immediately
38 preceding biennium increased by an amount not less than the rate of
39 increase for the revenue collected by the State for general,
40 unrestricted uses as projected by the Economic Forum.
41 (b) [If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected
42 by the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that
43 is not greater than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of
44 enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
45 preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General Fund
-
*AB508*

– 8 –
1 for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
2 which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State
3 Education Fund from the State General Fund for the immediately
4 preceding biennium increased by an amount not less than the
5 combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the
6 public schools in this State.
7 (c)] If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected
8 by the State for general, unrestricted uses will decrease, an amount
9 of money in the State General Fund for transfer to the State
10 Education Fund for the subsequent biennium which is not less than
11 the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund from
12 the State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium
13 decreased by an amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the
14 revenue collected by the State as projected by the Economic Forum.
15 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, as part of the
16 proposed executive budget, the Governor shall, to the extent
17 practicable, include recommendations for:
18 (a) The statewide base per pupil funding amount, which must be
19 equal to the statewide base per pupil funding amount for the
20 immediately preceding biennium increased by an amount not less
21 than the [combined] rate of inflation [and the growth of enrollment
22 in the public schools] in this State unless the amount of money
23 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
24 Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately preceding
25 biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a
26 proportional reduction to both the statewide base per pupil funding
27 amount and the multiplier for each category of pupils pursuant to
28 paragraph (b); and
29 (b) The multiplier for each category of pupils, which must not
30 be less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding biennium
31 unless:
32 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
33 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
34 from the immediately preceding biennium, in which event the
35 Governor must recommend a proportional reduction to both the
36 statewide base per pupil funding amount pursuant to paragraph (a)
37 and the multiplier for each category of pupils; or
38 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
39 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
40 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after
41 recommending the statewide base per pupil funding amount
42 pursuant to paragraph (a), is insufficient to fund the multiplier for
43 each category of pupils, in which event the Governor must
44 recommend the remaining money in the State Education Fund,
45 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, be used to provide a
-
*AB508*

– 9 –
1 multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
2 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year.
3 3. When determining the amount of money to reserve for
4 transfer from the State General Fund to the State Education Fund
5 pursuant to subsection 1, the Governor shall consider the
6 recommendations of the Commission, as revised by the Joint
7 Interim Standing Committee on Education, if applicable, for an
8 optimal level of funding for education and may reserve an additional
9 amount of money for transfer to the State Education Fund that the
10 Governor determines to be sufficient to fund any recommendation
11 or any portion of a recommendation that the Governor includes in
12 the proposed executive budget.
13 4. As part of the proposed executive budget, the Governor may
14 recommend to the Legislature a revision to any appropriation made
15 by law pursuant to NRS 387.1214, including, without limitation, the
16 statewide base per pupil funding amount, the adjusted base per pupil
17 funding for any school district, the multiplier for weighted funding
18 for any category of pupils or the creation or elimination of a
19 category of pupils to receive additional weighted funding. The
20 Governor may recommend additional funding for any
21 recommendation made pursuant to this subsection.
22 5. If the Governor determines that it would be impracticable to
23 prepare the proposed executive budget as described in subsection 1
24 or 2, the Governor may instead include in the proposed executive
25 budget a recommendation for such funding for the public schools in
26 this State as he or she determines to be appropriate. If the Governor
27 includes in the proposed executive budget recommendations
28 pursuant to this subsection, the recommendations must be
29 accompanied by such recommendations for legislation as the
30 Governor determines to be appropriate to improve the method by
31 which funding for the public schools in this State is determined.
32 6. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” means the average
33 percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for
34 All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the
35 United States Department of Labor for the immediately preceding 3
36 calendar years or, if that index ceases to be published by the United
37 States Department of Labor, the published index that most closely
38 resembles that index, as determined by the Governor.
39 Sec. 5. 1. There is hereby appropriated from the State
40 General Fund to the Cannabis Compliance Board to pay the costs of
41 the Board in carrying out the provisions of chapters 678C and 678D
42 of NRS the following sums:
43 For the Fiscal Year 2025-2026 ............................. $15,969,281
44 For the Fiscal Year 2026-2027 ............................. $16,423,385
-
*AB508*

– 10 –
1 2. Any balance of the sums appropriated by subsection 1
2 remaining at the end of the respective fiscal years must not be
3 committed for expenditure after June 30 of the respective fiscal
4 years by the entity to which the appropriation is made or any entity
5 to which money from the appropriation is granted or otherwise
6 transferred in any manner, and any portion of the appropriated
7 money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after
8 September 18, 2026, and September 17, 2027, respectively, by
9 either the entity to which the money was appropriated or the entity
10 to which the money was subsequently granted or transferred, and
11 must be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
12 September 18, 2026, and September 17, 2027, respectively.
