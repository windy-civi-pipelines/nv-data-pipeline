Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the board of trustees of a school district in which more than
2 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only the Clark County School District) is composed
3 of 11 members, of whom: (1) seven voting members are elected from election districts
4 established by the board of trustees; (2) one nonvoting member is appointed by the
5 board of county commissioners of the county in which the school district is located; and
6 (3) three nonvoting members are appointed by the governing bodies of the three most
7 populous incorporated cities in the county in which the school district is located, with
8 each governing body appointing one member. Existing law prohibits a nonvoting
9 member from voting on the election of officers of the board of trustees or serving as an
10 officer of the board of trustees. (NRS 386.165) Section 1 of this bill provides that the
11 appointed members of the board of trustees of a school district in which more than
12 75,000 pupils are enrolled have the same duties, rights and responsibilities as the
13 members of the board of trustees who are elected to the office. Section 1 prohibits a
14 board of trustees from adopting a policy, bylaw or practice or otherwise restricting or
15 curtailing the duties, rights or responsibilities of a member based on whether the
16 member was elected or appointed to office. Section 3 of this bill authorizes appointed
17 members of a board of trustees to participate in the appointment of a member to fill a
18 vacancy among the elected members of the board of trustees. Section 4 of this bill

Assembly Amendment No. 291 to Assembly Bill No. 156 Page 4
19 authorizes appointed members of a board of trustees to serve as officers of the board of
20 trustees.
21 The Nevada Constitution prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from being
22 elected to any state office or local governing body if he or she has served in that office, or
23 at the expiration of his or her current term if he or she is so serving, will have served, 12
24 years or more. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Section 2 of this bill prohibits a person, elected
25 or appointed, from serving as a trustee for any school district or combination of school
26 districts for 12 years or more.
27 Existing law establishes the salaries for the members of the board of trustees of school
28 districts based on the population of the county in which the school district is located. Under
29 existing law, the salary of a member of the board of trustees of a school district in a county
30 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) is $750 per
31 month. (NRS 386.320) Section [1] 5 of this bill increases the salary of [a] an elected member
32 of the board of trustees of a school district in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
33 (currently only the Clark County School District) to an amount equal to the base salary of a
34 county commissioner of that county. Existing law establishes the base salary of such a county
35 commissioner as an amount equal to 112.551 percent of the amount of the base annual salary
36 for a county commissioner that was in effect on January 1, 2015. (NRS 245.043) Section 5
37 authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county whose population is less than
38 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County), or an appointing authority of
39 an appointed member of a board of trustees in a county whose population is 700,000 or
40 more (currently only Clark County), to provide additional compensation for a member
41 of the board of trustees such that the salary of the member is equal to the salary of a
42 county commissioner in that county. Section 5 requires the salary of a member of the
43 board of trustees to be paid from the funds of the school district, except that any
44 additional compensation authorized to be paid by the board of county commissioners or
45 an appointing authority must be paid from the funds of that entity.
46 Section [2] 8 of this bill limits the salary increase [pursuant to] authorized in section [1
47 to] 5 for the elected members of the boards of trustees of [the] a school district in a county
48 whose population is 700,000 or more to those members who were elected [or appointed] to
49 a term of office that begins on or after January 1, 2027, including members who are reelected
50 [or reappointed] to a term of office that begins on or after that date. Section 8 prohibits the
51 salary of an appointed member of the board of trustees of a school district in a county
52 whose population is 700,000 or more from being increased by the appointing authority
53 without the consent of the member during any term that is being served on January 1,
54 2027. Section 9 of this bill prohibits a school district from reducing the compensation for
55 teachers and other educational personnel and support staff to fund the increase in
56 compensation for elected members of a board of trustees required by section 5.
57 Section 6 of this bill prohibits a board of trustees from conducting certain business
58 related to the members of the board of trustees and their duties at a meeting that has
59 been designated as a work session or workshop. Section 6 also requires appointed
60 members to be included in the membership of a board of trustees for the purposes of
61 calculating the existence of a quorum for the transaction of business.
62 Existing law authorizes a board of trustees to accept on behalf of and for the school
63 district certain gifts or bequests of money or property. (NRS 386.390) Section 7 of this
64 bill, subject to certain limitations, authorizes a member of the board of trustees to solicit
65 such a gift or bequest on behalf of and for the school district.
