Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the board of trustees of a school district in which more than
2 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only the Clark County School District) is
3 composed of 11 members, of whom: (1) seven voting members are elected from
4 election districts established by the board of trustees; (2) one nonvoting member is
5 appointed by the board of county commissioners of the county in which the school
6 district is located; and (3) three nonvoting members are appointed by the governing
7 bodies of the three most populous incorporated cities in the county in which the
8 school district is located, with each governing body appointing one member.
9 Existing law prohibits a nonvoting member from voting on the election of officers
10 of the board of trustees or serving as an officer of the board of trustees. (NRS
11 386.165) Section 1 of this bill provides that the appointed members of the board of
12 trustees of a school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled have the
13 same duties, rights and responsibilities as the members of the board of trustees who
14 are elected to the office. Section 1 prohibits a board of trustees from adopting a
-
*AB156_R1*

– 2 –
15 policy, bylaw or practice or otherwise restricting or curtailing the duties, rights or
16 responsibilities of a member based on whether the member was elected or
17 appointed to office. Section 3 of this bill authorizes appointed members of a board
18 of trustees to participate in the appointment of a member to fill a vacancy among
19 the elected members of the board of trustees. Section 4 of this bill authorizes
20 appointed members of a board of trustees to serve as officers of the board of
21 trustees.
22 The Nevada Constitution prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person from
23 being elected to any state office or local governing body if he or she has served in
24 that office, or at the expiration of his or her current term if he or she is so serving,
25 will have served, 12 years or more. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Section 2 of this bill
26 prohibits a person, elected or appointed, from serving as a trustee for any school
27 district or combination of school districts for 12 years or more.
28 Existing law establishes the salaries for the members of the board of trustees of
29 school districts based on the population of the county in which the school district is
30 located. Under existing law, the salary of a member of the board of trustees of a
31 school district in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark
32 and Washoe Counties) is $750 per month. (NRS 386.320) Section 5 of this bill
33 increases the salary of an elected member of the board of trustees of a school
34 district in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only the Clark
35 County School District) to an amount equal to the base salary of a county
36 commissioner of that county. Existing law establishes the base salary of such a
37 county commissioner as an amount equal to 112.551 percent of the amount of the
38 base annual salary for a county commissioner that was in effect on January 1, 2015.
39 (NRS 245.043) Section 5 authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county
40 whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
41 County), or an appointing authority of an appointed member of a board of trustees
42 in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), to
43 provide additional compensation for a member of the board of trustees such that the
44 salary of the member is equal to the salary of a county commissioner in that county.
45 Section 5 requires the salary of a member of the board of trustees to be paid from
46 the funds of the school district, except that any additional compensation authorized
47 to be paid by the board of county commissioners or an appointing authority must be
48 paid from the funds of that entity.
49 Section 8 of this bill limits the salary increase authorized in section 5 for the
50 elected members of the boards of trustees of a school district in a county whose
51 population is 700,000 or more to those members who were elected to a term of
52 office that begins on or after January 1, 2027, including members who are reelected
53 to a term of office that begins on or after that date. Section 8 prohibits the salary of
54 an appointed member of the board of trustees of a school district in a county whose
55 population is 700,000 or more from being increased by the appointing authority
56 without the consent of the member during any term that is being served on
57 January 1, 2027. Section 9 of this bill prohibits a school district from reducing the
58 compensation for teachers and other educational personnel and support staff to fund
59 the increase in compensation for elected members of a board of trustees required by
60 section 5.
61 Section 6 of this bill prohibits a board of trustees from conducting certain
62 business related to the members of the board of trustees and their duties at a
63 meeting that has been designated as a work session or workshop. Section 6 also
64 requires appointed members to be included in the membership of a board of trustees
65 for the purposes of calculating the existence of a quorum for the transaction of
66 business.
67 Existing law authorizes a board of trustees to accept on behalf of and for the
68 school district certain gifts or bequests of money or property. (NRS 386.390)
69 Section 7 of this bill, subject to certain limitations, authorizes a member of the
-
*AB156_R1*

– 3 –
70 board of trustees to solicit such a gift or bequest on behalf of and for the school
71 district.
