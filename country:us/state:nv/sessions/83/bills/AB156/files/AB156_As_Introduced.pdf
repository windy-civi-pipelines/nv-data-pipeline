Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the salaries for the members of the board of trustees of
2 school districts based on the population of the county in which the school district is
3 located. Under existing law, the salary of a member of the board of trustees of a
4 school district in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark
5 and Washoe Counties) is $750 per month. (NRS 386.320) Section 1 of this bill
6 increases the salary of a member of the board of trustees of a school district in a
7 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County) to an amount
8 equal to the base salary of a county commissioner of that county. Existing law
9 establishes the base salary of such a county commissioner as an amount equal to
10 112.551 percent of the amount of the base annual salary for a county commissioner
11 that was in effect on January 1, 2015. (NRS 245.043) Section 2 of this bill limits
12 the salary increase pursuant to section 1 to members of the boards of trustees of the
13 school district who were elected or appointed to a term of office that begins on or
14 after January 1, 2027, including members who are reelected or reappointed to a
15 term of office that begins on or after that date.
