Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to school counselors.
(BDR 34-532)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring each public school to
employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and to
provide for a comprehensive program for school
counseling developed by a school counselor; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a public school, including, without limitation, a charter
2 school, to employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a
3 comprehensive program for school counseling developed by a school counselor
4 only to the extent that money is available for that purpose. (NRS 388.055) Section
5 1 of this bill eliminates the provision which makes these requirements contingent
6 upon the availability of money for that purpose, thereby requiring each public
7 school to employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a
8 comprehensive program for school counseling developed by a school counselor.
9 To conform with the change in section 1 requiring each public school to
10 employ a school counselor on a full-time basis, sections 2 and 3 of this bill
11 eliminate language which makes the appointment of certain persons, including a
12 school counselor, school psychologist or social worker, to teams involved in the
13 provision of a safe and respectful learning environment at a school contingent upon
14 the school employing such a person on a full-time basis.
