15 Sections 5-8 and 16-20 of this bill codify similar provisions into state law,
16 thereby requiring health facilities and providers of health care to take reasonable
17 steps to ensure that language barriers do not prevent a person with limited English
18 proficiency from obtaining necessary access to health care. Sections 5, 16 and 20
19 prescribe certain factors for determining whether an action is necessary for a health
20 facility or provider of health care to be in compliance with that requirement.
21 Sections 5 and 16 require that a service to provide language assistance be available
22 free of charge, be accurate in translation or interpretation be provided in a timely
23 manner and protect the ability of the person with limited English proficiency to
24 make independent decisions. Sections 5 and 16 require that a qualified translator
25 review a machine-translated document under certain circumstances.
26 Sections 5 and 16 require a health facility or provider of health care to use a
27 qualified interpreter or translator to provide interpreting or translating services, and
28 sections 8 and 19 establish the qualifications to serve as an interpreter or translator.
29 Sections 6 and 17 prohibit the use of an unqualified interpreter, except in certain
30 circumstances. Sections 6 and 17 also prohibit a health facility or provider of
31 health care from requiring a person with limited English proficiency to provide his
32 or her own interpreter or pay the cost of an interpreter. Sections 7 and 18 prescribe
33 requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter. Sections 3, 4 and 15 of this
34 bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of the
35 definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make
36 conforming changes to establish the applicability of certain provisions. Sections
37 11-13, 20 and 21 of this bill prescribe various mechanisms for the enforcement of
38 sections 5-8 and 16-19, including the imposition of administrative sanctions
39 against a health facility that fails to comply with those provisions and professional
40 discipline against a provider of health care who fails to comply with those
41 provisions.

3 proficiency who are eligible to be served or likely to be directly affected by a health
4 program or activity of the entity. (45 C.F.R. § 92.201(a)) The Director of the Office
5 for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has
6 provided additional guidance by defining meaningful access to mean ensuring that
7 language barriers do not prevent a person from obtaining necessary health services
8 and care. (Melanie Fontes Rainer, Director, Office for Civil Rights U.S. Dep’t. of
9 Health and Human Services (Dec. 5, 2024), Dear Colleague Letter Regarding
10 Language Access Provisions of the Final Rule Implementing Section 1557 of the

15 Sections 5-8 and 16-20 of this bill codify similar provisions into state law,
16 thereby requiring health facilities and providers of health care to take reasonable
17 steps to ensure that language barriers do not prevent a person with limited English
18 proficiency from obtaining necessary access to health care. Sections 5, 16 and 20
19 prescribe certain factors for determining whether an action is necessary for a health
20 facility or provider of health care to be in compliance with that requirement.
21 Sections 5 and 16 require that a service to provide language assistance be available
22 free of charge, be accurate in translation or interpretation be provided in a timely
23 manner and protect the ability of the person with limited English proficiency to
24 make independent decisions. Sections 5 and 16 require that a qualified translator
25 review a machine-translated document under certain circumstances.
26 Sections 5 and 16 require a health facility or provider of health care to use a
27 qualified interpreter or translator to provide interpreting or translating services, and
28 sections 8 and 19 establish the qualifications to serve as an interpreter or translator.
29 Sections 6 and 17 prohibit the use of an unqualified interpreter, except in certain
30 circumstances. Sections 6 and 17 also prohibit a health facility or provider of
31 health care from requiring a person with limited English proficiency to provide his
32 or her own interpreter or pay the cost of an interpreter. Sections 7 and 18 prescribe
33 requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter. Sections 3, 4 and 15 of this
34 bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of the
35 definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make
36 conforming changes to establish the applicability of certain provisions. Sections
37 11-13, 20 and 21 of this bill prescribe various mechanisms for the enforcement of
38 sections 5-8 and 16-19, including the imposition of administrative sanctions
39 against a health facility that fails to comply with those provisions and professional
40 discipline against a provider of health care who fails to comply with those
41 provisions.
