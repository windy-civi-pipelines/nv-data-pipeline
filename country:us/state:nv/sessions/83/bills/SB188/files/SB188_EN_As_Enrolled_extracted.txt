CHAPTER..........

and providers of health care to take reasonable steps to
provide a person with limited English proficiency with
language assistance under certain circumstances; prescribing
requirements governing the use of interpreters and translators
to comply with that requirement; authorizing the discipline of
certain health facilities and providers of health care for

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations require certain health care entities to take
reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to persons with limited English
proficiency who are eligible to be served or likely to be directly affected by a health
program or activity of the entity. (45 C.F.R. § 92.201(a)) The Director of the Office
for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has
provided additional guidance by defining meaningful access to mean ensuring that
language barriers do not prevent a person from obtaining necessary health services
and care. (Melanie Fontes Rainer, Director, Office for Civil Rights U.S. Dep’t. of
Health and Human Services (Dec. 5, 2024), Dear Colleague Letter Regarding
Language Access Provisions of the Final Rule Implementing Section 1557 of the
Affordable Care Act, retrieved from http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-dcl-

Section 2:
section-1557-language-access.pdf) Existing federal regulations prescribe various
requirements and procedures governing the use of interpreters and translators to
comply with those requirements. (45 C.F.R. § 92.201)

Section 3:
Sections 5-8 and 16-20 of this bill codify similar provisions into state law,
thereby requiring certain health facilities and providers of health care to take
reasonable steps to ensure that language barriers do not prevent a person with
limited English proficiency from obtaining necessary access to health care.

Section 4:
Sections 5, 16 and 20 prescribe certain factors for determining whether an action is
necessary for a health facility or provider of health care to be in compliance with
that requirement. Sections 5 and 16 require that a service to provide language
assistance be available free of charge, be accurate in translation or interpretation, be
provided in a timely manner and protect the ability of the person with limited
English proficiency to make independent decisions. Sections 5 and 16 require that
a qualified translator review a machine-translated document under certain
circumstances.

Section 5:
Sections 5 and 16 require a health facility or provider of health care to use a
qualified interpreter or translator to provide interpreting or translating services, and

Section 6:
sections 8 and 19 establish the qualifications to serve as an interpreter or translator.

Section 7:
Sections 6 and 17 prohibit the use of an unqualified interpreter, except in certain
circumstances. Sections 6 and 17 also prohibit a health facility or provider of
health care from requiring a person with limited English proficiency to provide his
or her own interpreter or pay the cost of an interpreter. Sections 7 and 18 prescribe
requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter. Sections 3, 4 and 15 of this
bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of the
definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make
conforming changes to establish the applicability of certain provisions.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 188–Senator Doñate
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health facilities
and providers of health care to take reasonable steps to
provide a person with limited English proficiency with
language assistance under certain circumstances; prescribing
requirements governing the use of interpreters and translators
to comply with that requirement; authorizing the discipline of
certain health facilities and providers of health care for
certain violations; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations require certain health care entities to take
reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to persons with limited English
proficiency who are eligible to be served or likely to be directly affected by a health
program or activity of the entity. (45 C.F.R. § 92.201(a)) The Director of the Office
for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has
provided additional guidance by defining meaningful access to mean ensuring that
language barriers do not prevent a person from obtaining necessary health services
and care. (Melanie Fontes Rainer, Director, Office for Civil Rights U.S. Dep’t. of
Health and Human Services (Dec. 5, 2024), Dear Colleague Letter Regarding
Language Access Provisions of the Final Rule Implementing Section 1557 of the
Affordable Care Act, retrieved from http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr-dcl-
section-1557-language-access.pdf) Existing federal regulations prescribe various
requirements and procedures governing the use of interpreters and translators to
comply with those requirements. (45 C.F.R. § 92.201)
Sections 5-8 and 16-20 of this bill codify similar provisions into state law,
thereby requiring certain health facilities and providers of health care to take
reasonable steps to ensure that language barriers do not prevent a person with
limited English proficiency from obtaining necessary access to health care.
Sections 5, 16 and 20 prescribe certain factors for determining whether an action is
necessary for a health facility or provider of health care to be in compliance with
that requirement. Sections 5 and 16 require that a service to provide language
assistance be available free of charge, be accurate in translation or interpretation, be
provided in a timely manner and protect the ability of the person with limited
English proficiency to make independent decisions. Sections 5 and 16 require that
a qualified translator review a machine-translated document under certain
circumstances.
Sections 5 and 16 require a health facility or provider of health care to use a
qualified interpreter or translator to provide interpreting or translating services, and
sections 8 and 19 establish the qualifications to serve as an interpreter or translator.
Sections 6 and 17 prohibit the use of an unqualified interpreter, except in certain
circumstances. Sections 6 and 17 also prohibit a health facility or provider of
health care from requiring a person with limited English proficiency to provide his
or her own interpreter or pay the cost of an interpreter. Sections 7 and 18 prescribe
requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter. Sections 3, 4 and 15 of this
bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of the
definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4. Sections 9 and 10 of this bill make
conforming changes to establish the applicability of certain provisions.

83rd Session (2025)

Sections 11-13, 20 and 21 of this bill prescribe various mechanisms for the
enforcement of sections 5-8 and 16-19, including the imposition of administrative
sanctions against a health facility that fails to comply with those provisions and
professional discipline against a provider of health care who fails to comply with
those provisions.
