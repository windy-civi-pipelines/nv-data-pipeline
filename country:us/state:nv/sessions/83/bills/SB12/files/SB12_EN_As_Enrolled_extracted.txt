Office within the Office of the Governor; transferring the
powers and duties of the Office of the Chief Information
Officer within the Office of the Governor to the Governor’s

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Office of the Chief Information Officer within the
Office of the Governor, consisting of certain units, offices and other units, groups
divisions or departments. (NRS 242.080) Existing law sets forth certain duties and
responsibilities of the Office of the Chief Information Officer, including providing
certain information services to state agencies, elected state officers and, under
certain circumstances, agencies not under the control of the Governor and local
government agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141)

Section 2:
Section 6 of this bill renames the Office of the Chief Information Officer as the
Governor’s Technology Office. Sections 1, 3-5, 7, 9, 11-14, 16, 18 and 23-30 of
this bill make conforming changes by applying various provisions of the Nevada
Revised Statutes relating to the Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to
the Governor’s Technology Office.
Existing law provides that the Office of the Chief Information Officer is
composed of: (1) the Administration Unit; (2) the Client Services Unit; (3) the
Computing Services Unit; (4) the Network Services Unit, including a Network
Transport Services Group and a Telecommunications Group; (5) the Office of
Information Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments
deemed necessary by the Chief Information Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 6
provides instead that the Governor’s Technology Office is composed of: (1) the
Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services Division; (3) the Computing Services
Division; (4) the Network Services Division, including a Network Transport
Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit; (5) the Office of Information
Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments deemed
necessary by the Chief Information Officer. Sections 10, 17, 19-22 and 25 of this
bill make conforming changes to apply various provisions of the Nevada Revised
Statutes relating to the former units, groups, offices, divisions or departments of the
Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to the units, groups, offices,
divisions or departments of the Governor’s Technology Office.
Existing law requires the Chief Information Officer to appoint a Deputy Chief
of the Office of Information Security who is in the classified service of the State.
(NRS 242.101) Section 7 instead places the Deputy Chief of the Office of
Information Security in the unclassified service of the State. Section 31 of this bill
clarifies that the person who is in the position of Deputy Chief of the Office on
July 1, 2025, is in the classified service and must remain in the classified service
until he or she vacates that position.
Existing law creates an Information Technology Advisory Board, which has
various duties including: (1) advising the Office of the Chief Information Officer
concerning issues relating to information technology; (2) periodically reviewing the
Office’s statewide strategic plans and standards manual for information technology;
-

(3) reviewing the Office’s budget; and (4) consulting and coordinating with state
agencies on certain regulations, policies, standards and guidelines. (NRS 242.122,

Section 3:
242.124, 242.125) Section 8 of this bill replaces the Director of the Department of
Administration as a member of the Advisory Board with the Chief Information
Officer.
Existing law: (1) requires the Chief of the Office of Information Security to
investigate and resolve certain breaches related to an information system of a state
agency or elected official in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the Chief of
the Office of Information Security to notify members of certain boards and
commissions of a breach of certain information systems in certain circumstances.
(NRS 242.183) Section 9 instead: (1) requires the Deputy Chief of the Office of
Information Security to investigate and resolve such breaches; and (2) authorizes
the Deputy Chief to provide such notifications.
Senate Bill No. 431 of the 2023 Legislative Session eliminated the Division of
Enterprise Information Technology Services of the Department of Administration
and transferred the powers and duties of the Division to the Office of the Chief
Information Officer. (Chapter 532, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3544) Existing
law defines the terms “Administrator,” “Department” and “Division” as they relate
to the former Division. (NRS 233F.015, 233F.055, 233F.059, 242.013, 242.031,

Section 4:
242.045) Section 34 of this bill repeals these obsolete definitions. Sections 2 and
15 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to certain repealed
definitions.

Senate Bill No. 12–Committee on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; creating and
setting forth the composition of the Governor’s Technology
Office within the Office of the Governor; transferring the
powers and duties of the Office of the Chief Information
Officer within the Office of the Governor to the Governor’s
Technology Office; revising the classification and duties of
the Deputy Chief of the Office of Information Security; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Office of the Chief Information Officer within the
Office of the Governor, consisting of certain units, offices and other units, groups
divisions or departments. (NRS 242.080) Existing law sets forth certain duties and
responsibilities of the Office of the Chief Information Officer, including providing
certain information services to state agencies, elected state officers and, under
certain circumstances, agencies not under the control of the Governor and local
government agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141)
Section 6 of this bill renames the Office of the Chief Information Officer as the
Governor’s Technology Office. Sections 1, 3-5, 7, 9, 11-14, 16, 18 and 23-30 of
this bill make conforming changes by applying various provisions of the Nevada
Revised Statutes relating to the Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to
the Governor’s Technology Office.
Existing law provides that the Office of the Chief Information Officer is
composed of: (1) the Administration Unit; (2) the Client Services Unit; (3) the
Computing Services Unit; (4) the Network Services Unit, including a Network
Transport Services Group and a Telecommunications Group; (5) the Office of
Information Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments
deemed necessary by the Chief Information Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 6
provides instead that the Governor’s Technology Office is composed of: (1) the
Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services Division; (3) the Computing Services
Division; (4) the Network Services Division, including a Network Transport
Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit; (5) the Office of Information
Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments deemed
necessary by the Chief Information Officer. Sections 10, 17, 19-22 and 25 of this
bill make conforming changes to apply various provisions of the Nevada Revised
Statutes relating to the former units, groups, offices, divisions or departments of the
Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to the units, groups, offices,
divisions or departments of the Governor’s Technology Office.
Existing law requires the Chief Information Officer to appoint a Deputy Chief
of the Office of Information Security who is in the classified service of the State.
(NRS 242.101) Section 7 instead places the Deputy Chief of the Office of
Information Security in the unclassified service of the State. Section 31 of this bill
clarifies that the person who is in the position of Deputy Chief of the Office on
July 1, 2025, is in the classified service and must remain in the classified service
until he or she vacates that position.
Existing law creates an Information Technology Advisory Board, which has
various duties including: (1) advising the Office of the Chief Information Officer
concerning issues relating to information technology; (2) periodically reviewing the
Office’s statewide strategic plans and standards manual for information technology;
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
(3) reviewing the Office’s budget; and (4) consulting and coordinating with state
agencies on certain regulations, policies, standards and guidelines. (NRS 242.122,
242.124, 242.125) Section 8 of this bill replaces the Director of the Department of
Administration as a member of the Advisory Board with the Chief Information
Officer.
Existing law: (1) requires the Chief of the Office of Information Security to
investigate and resolve certain breaches related to an information system of a state
agency or elected official in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the Chief of
the Office of Information Security to notify members of certain boards and
commissions of a breach of certain information systems in certain circumstances.
(NRS 242.183) Section 9 instead: (1) requires the Deputy Chief of the Office of
Information Security to investigate and resolve such breaches; and (2) authorizes
the Deputy Chief to provide such notifications.
Senate Bill No. 431 of the 2023 Legislative Session eliminated the Division of
Enterprise Information Technology Services of the Department of Administration
and transferred the powers and duties of the Division to the Office of the Chief
Information Officer. (Chapter 532, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3544) Existing
law defines the terms “Administrator,” “Department” and “Division” as they relate
to the former Division. (NRS 233F.015, 233F.055, 233F.059, 242.013, 242.031,
242.045) Section 34 of this bill repeals these obsolete definitions. Sections 2 and
15 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to certain repealed
definitions.
