Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Office of the Chief Information Officer within the
2 Office of the Governor, consisting of certain units, offices and other units, groups
3 divisions or departments. (NRS 242.080) Existing law sets forth certain duties and
4 responsibilities of the Office of the Chief Information Officer, including providing

7 government agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141)
8 Section 6 of this bill renames the Office of the Chief Information Officer as the
9 Governor’s Technology Office. Sections 1, 3-5, 7, 9, 11-14, 16, 18 and 23-30 of
10 this bill make conforming changes by applying various provisions of the Nevada
11 Revised Statutes relating to the Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to
12 the Governor’s Technology Office.
13 Existing law provides that the Office of the Chief Information Officer is
14 composed of: (1) the Administration Unit; (2) the Client Services Unit; (3) the
-

– 2 –
15 Computing Services Unit; (4) the Network Services Unit, including a Network
16 Transport Services Group and a Telecommunications Group; (5) the Office of
17 Information Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments
18 deemed necessary by the Chief Information Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 6
19 provides instead that the Governor’s Technology Office is composed of: (1) the
20 Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services Division; (3) the Computing Services
21 Division; (4) the Network Services Division, including a Network Transport
22 Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit; (5) the Office of Information
23 Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments deemed
24 necessary by the Chief Information Officer. Sections 10, 17, 19-22 and 25 of this
25 bill make conforming changes to apply various provisions of the Nevada Revised
26 Statutes relating to the former units, groups, offices, divisions or departments of the
27 Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to the units, groups, offices,
28 divisions or departments of the Governor’s Technology Office.
29 Existing law requires the Chief Information Officer to appoint a Deputy Chief
30 of the Office of Information Security who is in the classified service of the State.
31 (NRS 242.101) Section 7 instead places the Deputy Chief of the Office of
32 Information Security in the unclassified service of the State. Section 31 of this bill
33 clarifies that the person who is in the position of Deputy Chief of the Office on
34 July 1, 2025, is in the classified service and must remain in the classified service
35 until he or she vacates that position.
36 Existing law creates an Information Technology Advisory Board, which has
37 various duties including: (1) advising the Office of the Chief Information Officer
38 concerning issues relating to information technology; (2) periodically reviewing the
39 Office’s statewide strategic plans and standards manual for information technology;
40 (3) reviewing the Office’s budget; and (4) consulting and coordinating with state
41 agencies on certain regulations, policies, standards and guidelines. (NRS 242.122,
42 242.124, 242.125) Section 8 of this bill replaces the Director of the Department of
43 Administration as a member of the Advisory Board with the Chief Information
44 Officer.
45 Existing law: (1) requires the Chief of the Office of Information Security to
46 investigate and resolve certain breaches related to an information system of a state
47 agency or elected official in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the Chief of
48 the Office of Information Security to notify members of certain boards and
49 commissions of a breach of certain information systems in certain circumstances.
50 (NRS 242.183) Section 9 instead: (1) requires the Deputy Chief of the Office of
51 Information Security to investigate and resolve such breaches; and (2) authorizes
52 the Deputy Chief to provide such notifications.
53 Senate Bill No. 431 of the 2023 Legislative Session eliminated the Division of
54 Enterprise Information Technology Services of the Department of Administration
55 and transferred the powers and duties of the Division to the Office of the Chief
56 Information Officer. (Chapter 532, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3544) Existing
57 law defines the terms “Administrator,” “Department” and “Division” as they relate
58 to the former Division. (NRS 233F.015, 233F.055, 233F.059, 242.013, 242.031,
59 242.045) Section 34 of this bill repeals these obsolete definitions. Sections 2 and
60 15 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to certain repealed
61 definitions.

(ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER
IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR)
PREFILED OCTOBER 30, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Office of the Chief
Information Officer within the Office of the
Governor. (BDR 19-280)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; creating and
setting forth the composition of the Governor’s
Technology Office within the Office of the Governor;
transferring the powers and duties of the Office of the
Chief Information Officer within the Office of the
Governor to the Governor’s Technology Office; revising
the classification and duties of the Deputy Chief of the
Office of Information Security; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Office of the Chief Information Officer within the
2 Office of the Governor, consisting of certain units, offices and other units, groups
3 divisions or departments. (NRS 242.080) Existing law sets forth certain duties and
4 responsibilities of the Office of the Chief Information Officer, including providing
5 certain information services to state agencies, elected state officers and, under
6 certain circumstances, agencies not under the control of the Governor and local
7 government agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141)
8 Section 6 of this bill renames the Office of the Chief Information Officer as the
9 Governor’s Technology Office. Sections 1, 3-5, 7, 9, 11-14, 16, 18 and 23-30 of
10 this bill make conforming changes by applying various provisions of the Nevada
11 Revised Statutes relating to the Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to
12 the Governor’s Technology Office.
13 Existing law provides that the Office of the Chief Information Officer is
14 composed of: (1) the Administration Unit; (2) the Client Services Unit; (3) the
-
*SB12*

– 2 –
15 Computing Services Unit; (4) the Network Services Unit, including a Network
16 Transport Services Group and a Telecommunications Group; (5) the Office of
17 Information Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments
18 deemed necessary by the Chief Information Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 6
19 provides instead that the Governor’s Technology Office is composed of: (1) the
20 Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services Division; (3) the Computing Services
21 Division; (4) the Network Services Division, including a Network Transport
22 Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit; (5) the Office of Information
23 Security; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments deemed
24 necessary by the Chief Information Officer. Sections 10, 17, 19-22 and 25 of this
25 bill make conforming changes to apply various provisions of the Nevada Revised
26 Statutes relating to the former units, groups, offices, divisions or departments of the
27 Office of the Chief Information Officer instead to the units, groups, offices,
28 divisions or departments of the Governor’s Technology Office.
29 Existing law requires the Chief Information Officer to appoint a Deputy Chief
30 of the Office of Information Security who is in the classified service of the State.
31 (NRS 242.101) Section 7 instead places the Deputy Chief of the Office of
32 Information Security in the unclassified service of the State. Section 31 of this bill
33 clarifies that the person who is in the position of Deputy Chief of the Office on
34 July 1, 2025, is in the classified service and must remain in the classified service
35 until he or she vacates that position.
36 Existing law creates an Information Technology Advisory Board, which has
37 various duties including: (1) advising the Office of the Chief Information Officer
38 concerning issues relating to information technology; (2) periodically reviewing the
39 Office’s statewide strategic plans and standards manual for information technology;
40 (3) reviewing the Office’s budget; and (4) consulting and coordinating with state
41 agencies on certain regulations, policies, standards and guidelines. (NRS 242.122,
42 242.124, 242.125) Section 8 of this bill replaces the Director of the Department of
43 Administration as a member of the Advisory Board with the Chief Information
44 Officer.
45 Existing law: (1) requires the Chief of the Office of Information Security to
46 investigate and resolve certain breaches related to an information system of a state
47 agency or elected official in certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes the Chief of
48 the Office of Information Security to notify members of certain boards and
49 commissions of a breach of certain information systems in certain circumstances.
50 (NRS 242.183) Section 9 instead: (1) requires the Deputy Chief of the Office of
51 Information Security to investigate and resolve such breaches; and (2) authorizes
52 the Deputy Chief to provide such notifications.
53 Senate Bill No. 431 of the 2023 Legislative Session eliminated the Division of
54 Enterprise Information Technology Services of the Department of Administration
55 and transferred the powers and duties of the Division to the Office of the Chief
56 Information Officer. (Chapter 532, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3544) Existing
57 law defines the terms “Administrator,” “Department” and “Division” as they relate
58 to the former Division. (NRS 233F.015, 233F.055, 233F.059, 242.013, 242.031,
59 242.045) Section 34 of this bill repeals these obsolete definitions. Sections 2 and
60 15 of this bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to certain repealed
61 definitions.
