SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to pornography involving
minors. (BDR 15-520)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding certain prohibitions relating
to pornography involving minors; revising the penalties
for certain crimes relating to pornography involving
minors; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or
2 distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or
3 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B
4 felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not
5 less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 15 years, or by a fine of not
6 more than $15,000 or both. (NRS 200.725) Section 2 of this bill expands this
7 prohibition to include computer-generated child pornography. Section 2 also
8 revises the applicable criminal penalties by: (1) subjecting each person found guilty
9 of violating the prohibition to a term of imprisonment in state prison; (2) providing
10 that a person who is found guilty of a second or subsequent violation is guilty of a
11 category A felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum
12 term of not less than 10 years and a maximum term of life with the possibility of
13 parole; and (3) providing that a person who is found guilty of a violation of section
14 2 may not be convicted of a violation of section 3 of this bill for possessing the
15 same material.
16 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
17 her possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a person
18 under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in,
-
*SB263*
– 2 –
19 simulating or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of:
20 (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any
21 subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 expands this prohibition to include
22 computer-generated child pornography. Section 3 also increases the minimum term
23 of imprisonment for subsequent offenses from 1 year to 5 years.
24 Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex
25 offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445,
26 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these
27 requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS
28 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability of offenses involving
29 pornography and a minor, sections 2 and 3 have the effect of requiring a person
30 convicted of a violation of section 2 or 3 to: (1) register as a sex offender under
31 certain circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to
32 sex offenders. Section 1 of this bill defines certain terms for the purposes of
33 sections 2 and 3.
34 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change that is necessary to reflect the
35 revision to the organization of existing law made by section 3.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or
2 distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or
3 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B
4 felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not

22 computer-generated child pornography. Section 3 also increases the minimum term
