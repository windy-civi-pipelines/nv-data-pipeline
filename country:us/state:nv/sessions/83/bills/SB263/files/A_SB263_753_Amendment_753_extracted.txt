SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to pornography involving minors.
(BDR 15-520)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding certain prohibitions relating to pornography
involving minors; revising the penalties for certain crimes relating to
pornography involving minors; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or distributes any
2 item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage
3 in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B felony, punishable by imprisonment in
4 the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more
5 than 15 years, or by a fine of not more than $15,000 or both. (NRS 200.725) Section 2 of this
6 bill expands this prohibition to include computer-generated child pornography. Section 2 also
7 revises the applicable criminal penalties by: (1) [subjecting each person found guilty of
8 violating the prohibition to a term of imprisonment in state prison; (2)] providing that a person
9 who is found guilty of a second or subsequent violation is guilty of a category A felony,
10 punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 10 years
11 and a maximum term of life with the possibility of parole; and [(3)] (2) providing that a
12 person who is found guilty of a violation of section 2 may not be convicted of a violation of
13 section 3 of this bill for possessing the same material.
14 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or her
15 possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a person under the age
16 of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in, simulating or assisting others to
17 engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense;
18 and (2) a category A felony for any subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 expands
19 this prohibition to include computer-generated child pornography. [Section 3 also increases
20 the minimum term of imprisonment for subsequent offenses from 1 year to 5 years.]
21 Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex offender
22 and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445, 179D.460) Existing
23 law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these requirements to include any
24 offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3
Senate Amendment No. 753 to Senate Bill No. 263 Page 4
25 expand the applicability of offenses involving pornography and a minor, sections 2 and 3
26 have the effect of requiring a person convicted of a violation of section 2 or 3 to: (1) register
27 as a sex offender under certain circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements
28 applicable to sex offenders. Section 1 of this bill defines certain terms for the purposes of
29 sections 2 and 3.
30 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change that is necessary to reflect the revision
31 to the organization of existing law made by section 3.
