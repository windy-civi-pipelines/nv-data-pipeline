CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding certain prohibitions relating
to pornography involving minors; revising the penalties for
certain crimes relating to pornography involving minors; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or
distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or
assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B
felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not
less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 15 years, or by a fine of not
more than $15,000 or both. (NRS 200.725) Section 2 of this bill expands this
prohibition to include computer-generated child pornography. Section 2 also
revises the applicable criminal penalties by: (1) providing that a person who is
found guilty of a second or subsequent violation is guilty of a category A felony,
punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than
10 years and a maximum term of life with the possibility of parole; and (2)
providing that a person who is found guilty of a violation of section 2 may not be
convicted of a violation of section 3 of this bill for possessing the same material.
Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
her possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a person
under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in,
simulating or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of:
(1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any
subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 expands this prohibition to include
computer-generated child pornography.
Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex
offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445,
179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these
requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS
179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability of offenses involving
pornography and a minor, sections 2 and 3 have the effect of requiring a person
convicted of a violation of section 2 or 3 to: (1) register as a sex offender under
certain circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to
sex offenders. Section 1 of this bill defines certain terms for the purposes of

Section 2:
sections 2 and 3.

Section 3:
Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change that is necessary to reflect the
revision to the organization of existing law made by section 3.
