1 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
2 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
3 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
4 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
5 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
6 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
7 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
8 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
9 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
10 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
11 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
12 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
13 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
14 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
15 electronically, the confidential information from the information
16 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
17 confidential.

19 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
20 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
21 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
22 means of an electronic medium if:
23 (a) The public record:
24 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
25 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
26 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
27 means of an electronic medium would:
28 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
29 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
30 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
31 information that is not otherwise confidential.
32 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
33 has legal custody or control of a public record:
34 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
35 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
36 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
37 medium.
38 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
39 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
40 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
41 or herself.
42 Sec. 111. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage
43 and approval.
44 2. Sections 1 to 110, inclusive, of this act become effective:
-
*SB438*

1 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
2 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative

1 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
2 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
3 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
4 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
5 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
6 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
7 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
8 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
9 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
10 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
11 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
12 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
13 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
14 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
15 electronically, the confidential information from the information
16 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
17 confidential.

19 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
20 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
21 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
22 means of an electronic medium if:
23 (a) The public record:
24 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
25 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
26 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
27 means of an electronic medium would:
28 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
29 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
30 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
31 information that is not otherwise confidential.
32 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
33 has legal custody or control of a public record:
34 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
35 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
36 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
37 medium.
38 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
39 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
40 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
41 or herself.
42 Sec. 111. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage
43 and approval.
44 2. Sections 1 to 110, inclusive, of this act become effective:
-
*SB438*
