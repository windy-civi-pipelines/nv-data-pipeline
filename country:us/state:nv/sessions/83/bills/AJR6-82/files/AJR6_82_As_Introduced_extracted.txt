ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the
Nevada Constitution to adopt the National Popular Vote
Compact.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The United States Constitution requires the election of President and Vice
2 President by presidential electors from each state who are appointed in the manner
3 directed by each state legislature under the federal constitutional power granted to
4 states by the Presidential Electors Clause. (U.S. Const. Art. II, § 1, cl. 2, U.S.
5 Const. Amend. XII) The United States Supreme Court has stated that the
6 Presidential Electors Clause “concede[s] plenary power to the state legislatures in
7 the matter of the appointment of electors” and “recognizes that the people act
8 through their representatives in the legislature, and leaves it to the legislature
9 exclusively to define the method of effecting the object.” (McPherson v. Blacker,
10 146 U.S. 1, 27, 35 (1892)) The Supreme Court has also stated that the Presidential
11 Electors Clause was “so framed that congressional and federal influence might be
12 excluded” and, as a result, “the appointment and mode of appointment of electors
13 belong exclusively to the states under the [C]onstitution of the United States.”
14 (McPherson, 146 U.S. at 35)
15 Under existing law in Nevada, the Legislature has exercised its power to define
16 the method of appointing this State’s presidential electors by enacting the Uniform
-
*AJR6_82*
– 2 –
17 Faithful Presidential Electors Act. (NRS 298.005-298.089) Existing law requires
18 each nominee for presidential elector and alternate to sign a pledge to vote only for
19 the candidates for President and Vice President who receive the highest number of
20 votes in this State at the general election. (NRS 298.045) The nominees for
21 presidential elector whose candidates for President and Vice President receive the
22 highest number of votes in this State at the general election are the presidential
23 electors, and the presidential electors may vote only for the candidates for President
24 and Vice President who receive the highest number of votes in this State at the
25 general election. (NRS 298.065, 298.075)
26 The amendment to the Nevada Constitution proposed by this resolution enacts
27 the National Popular Vote Compact. If the Compact is effective and applies to a
28 presidential election: (1) the chief election official of each member state will
29 determine which slate of candidates for President and Vice President wins the
30 national popular vote and will designate that presidential slate as the national
31 popular vote winner; and (2) except in the case of a tie in the national popular vote,
32 the nominees for presidential elector whose slate of candidates for President and
33 Vice President is the national popular vote winner become the presidential electors.
34 The amendment to the Nevada Constitution proposed by this resolution also
35 provides that if the Compact is effective and applies to a presidential election, the
36 presidential electors shall, with limited exception, mark their presidential elector
37 ballots for the national popular vote winner. The amendment to the Nevada
38 Constitution proposed by this resolution also provides that Nevada may withdraw
39 from and rejoin the Compact via statute.
40 If this resolution is passed by the 2023 Legislature, it must also be passed by
41 the next Legislature and then approved and ratified by the voters in an election
42 before the proposed amendments become part of the Nevada Constitution.
43 However, for the Compact to take effect, states cumulatively possessing a majority
44 of the electoral votes must enact the Compact in substantially the same form and
45 the enactments by such states must have taken effect in each state.
1 WHEREAS, The candidate for the Presidency of the United States
2 receiving the most popular votes across the country should become
3 President; and
4 WHEREAS, The United States Constitution empowers each state
5 to choose the manner of selecting its members of the Electoral
6 College; now, therefore, be it
7 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF
8 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That a new section, designated Section 14A, be
9 added to Article 15 of the Nevada Constitution to read as follows:
10 Sec. 14A. The National Popular Vote Compact is
11 hereby enacted into law and entered into with all
12 jurisdictions legally joining the Compact, in substantially

27 association with the national popular vote winner.
28
29 At least six days before the day fixed by law for the
30 meeting and voting by the presidential electors, each
31 member state shall make a final determination of the
32 number of popular votes cast in the state for each
33 presidential slate and shall communicate an official
34 statement of such determination within 24 hours to the chief
35 election official of each other member state.
36
37 The chief election official of each member state shall
38 treat as conclusive an official statement containing the

10 candidate on the presidential slate that has been designated
11 as the national popular vote winner shall have the power to
12 nominate the presidential electors for that state and that
13 state’s presidential elector certifying official shall certify the
14 appointment of such nominees.
15
16 The chief election official of each member state shall
17 immediately release to the public all vote counts or
18 statements of votes as they are determined or obtained.

21 electors in each member state in any year in which this
22 compact is, on July 20, in effect in states cumulatively
23 possessing a majority of the electoral votes.
24
25 4. Other Provisions
26
27 This compact shall take effect when states cumulatively
28 possessing a majority of the electoral votes have enacted this
29 compact in substantially the same form and the enactments
30 by such states have taken effect in each state.
31
32 Any member state may withdraw from this compact,
33 except that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before
34 the end of a President’s term shall not become effective
35 until a President or Vice President shall have been qualified
36 to serve the next term.
37
38 The chief executive of each member state shall promptly
39 notify the chief executive of all other states of when this
40 compact has been enacted and has taken effect in that
41 official’s state, when the state has withdrawn from this
42 compact, and when this compact takes effect generally.
