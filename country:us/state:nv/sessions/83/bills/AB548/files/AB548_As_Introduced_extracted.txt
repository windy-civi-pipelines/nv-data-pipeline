EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vessels; requiring the Board of Wildlife
Commissioners to establish by regulation certain fees
concerning the numbering and titling of certain power-
driven vessels; revising the purposes for which the money
from such fees and other fees relating to vessels may be
used; revising provisions relating to the deposit of money
from certain fees by the Department of Wildlife with the
State Education Fund; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, every power-driven vessel for
2 which this State is the principal state of operation to be numbered and titled. (NRS
3 488.065) Existing law further requires the owner of each power-driven vessel
4 which is required to be numbered to file an application for a number and a
5 certificate of ownership with the Department of Wildlife. Existing law requires
6 such an application to be accompanied by an annual fee, the amount of which is
7 prescribed in existing law and determined by the straight line length of the power-
8 driven vessel, which is measured from the tip of the bow to the back of the transom
9 of the power-driven vessel. Finally, existing law requires the Board of Wildlife
10 Commissioners to adopt regulations providing for the renewal of a certificate of
11 number by the purchase of a validation decal and provides that the amount of the
12 fee for issuing a duplicate validation decal is $20. (NRS 488.075) Section 1 of this
13 bill removes the amounts set forth in existing law for such fees and instead requires
14 the Commission to establish by regulation: (1) a schedule of fees for the issuance
15 and renewal of the certificate, which must be based on the straight line length of a
16 power-driven vessel and the same for each; and (2) fees for issuing a duplicate

17 validation decal. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that
18 the fee for the issuance or renewal of a certificate of number for 2 years, if allowed,
19 is an amount which is equal to twice the annual fee for the vessel set forth in such
20 regulations.
21 Section 1 further authorizes the money from such fees and other fees relating to
22 vessels be expended only for projects to increase education concerning and access
23 to boating and the administration and enforcement of certain provisions relating to
24 vessels and wildlife, including, without limitation, any costs incurred when
25 assisting a law enforcement agency in the enforcement of the laws of this State that
26 are within the jurisdiction of a game warden.
27 Existing law requires the Department to, on or before December 31 of each
28 year, deposit with the State Education Fund 50 percent of each fee collected
29 according to the length of the power-driven vessel for every power-driven vessel
30 registered. (NRS 488.075) Section 1 instead requires the Department to, on or
31 before July 31 of each year, deposit with the Fund $800,000 from such fees
32 received by the Department. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
33 reflect the requirement for the Department to deposit a fixed amount of money in
34 the Fund instead of a portion of the fees.
35 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that no transfer of title to or any
36 interest in any power-driven vessel that is required to be numbered is effective until
37 the transferor: (1) has properly endorsed and delivered certain documents to the
38 transferee and the transferee has timely delivered such documents or placed such
39 documents in the United States mail addressed to the Department with the transfer
40 fee; or (2) has delivered or placed in the United States mail addressed to the
41 Department the appropriate documents for the transfer of ownership pursuant to the
42 sale or transfer. (NRS 488.1793) Section 4 of this bill requires the Commission to
43 prescribe a fee for the transfer of title of a power-driven vessel. Section 3 of this
44 bill makes a conforming change to reflect that such a fee is prescribed by regulation
45 of the Commission.
46 Section 6 of this bill provides that the existing fees for numbering and
47 transferring the title of a vessel remain in effect until the Commission has
48 established such fees by regulation.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to vessels.
(BDR 43-1127)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vessels; requiring the Board of Wildlife
Commissioners to establish by regulation certain fees
concerning the numbering and titling of certain power-
driven vessels; revising the purposes for which the money
from such fees and other fees relating to vessels may be
used; revising provisions relating to the deposit of money
from certain fees by the Department of Wildlife with the
State Education Fund; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, every power-driven vessel for
2 which this State is the principal state of operation to be numbered and titled. (NRS
3 488.065) Existing law further requires the owner of each power-driven vessel
4 which is required to be numbered to file an application for a number and a
5 certificate of ownership with the Department of Wildlife. Existing law requires
6 such an application to be accompanied by an annual fee, the amount of which is
7 prescribed in existing law and determined by the straight line length of the power-
8 driven vessel, which is measured from the tip of the bow to the back of the transom
9 of the power-driven vessel. Finally, existing law requires the Board of Wildlife
10 Commissioners to adopt regulations providing for the renewal of a certificate of
11 number by the purchase of a validation decal and provides that the amount of the
12 fee for issuing a duplicate validation decal is $20. (NRS 488.075) Section 1 of this
13 bill removes the amounts set forth in existing law for such fees and instead requires
14 the Commission to establish by regulation: (1) a schedule of fees for the issuance
15 and renewal of the certificate, which must be based on the straight line length of a
16 power-driven vessel and the same for each; and (2) fees for issuing a duplicate

17 validation decal. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that
18 the fee for the issuance or renewal of a certificate of number for 2 years, if allowed,
19 is an amount which is equal to twice the annual fee for the vessel set forth in such
20 regulations.
21 Section 1 further authorizes the money from such fees and other fees relating to
22 vessels be expended only for projects to increase education concerning and access
23 to boating and the administration and enforcement of certain provisions relating to
24 vessels and wildlife, including, without limitation, any costs incurred when
25 assisting a law enforcement agency in the enforcement of the laws of this State that
26 are within the jurisdiction of a game warden.
27 Existing law requires the Department to, on or before December 31 of each
28 year, deposit with the State Education Fund 50 percent of each fee collected
29 according to the length of the power-driven vessel for every power-driven vessel
30 registered. (NRS 488.075) Section 1 instead requires the Department to, on or
31 before July 31 of each year, deposit with the Fund $800,000 from such fees
32 received by the Department. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
33 reflect the requirement for the Department to deposit a fixed amount of money in
34 the Fund instead of a portion of the fees.
35 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that no transfer of title to or any
36 interest in any power-driven vessel that is required to be numbered is effective until
37 the transferor: (1) has properly endorsed and delivered certain documents to the
38 transferee and the transferee has timely delivered such documents or placed such
39 documents in the United States mail addressed to the Department with the transfer
40 fee; or (2) has delivered or placed in the United States mail addressed to the
41 Department the appropriate documents for the transfer of ownership pursuant to the
42 sale or transfer. (NRS 488.1793) Section 4 of this bill requires the Commission to
43 prescribe a fee for the transfer of title of a power-driven vessel. Section 3 of this
44 bill makes a conforming change to reflect that such a fee is prescribed by regulation
45 of the Commission.
46 Section 6 of this bill provides that the existing fees for numbering and
47 transferring the title of a vessel remain in effect until the Commission has
48 established such fees by regulation.
