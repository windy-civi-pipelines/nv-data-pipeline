EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring certain public utilities to submit to
the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada an annual report relating to
the infrastructure of the public utility; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations
2 which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of rates for public utilities
3 which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, to persons within this
4 State for compensation, and which: (1) serve 3,000 or fewer persons; and (2) had gross sales
5 for water or services for the disposal of sewage, considered separately, amounting to
6 $2,000,000 or less for the immediately preceding 12-month period. (NRS 704.095) This bill
7 requires such a public utility to submit an annual report to the Commission relating to the
8 infrastructure of the public utility if the public utility is located in a county whose population
9 is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and the public utility serves at least 250
10 persons. This bill requires the report to be submitted each year on or before a date established
11 by the Commission and to include, without limitation: (1) information concerning the
12 [condition] adequacy of the infrastructure of the public utility, including, without limitation,
13 the adequacy of the infrastructure to furnish a reasonably adequate supply of water for
14 fire protection and the sufficiency and availability of any water rights that are necessary to
15 provide service; and (2) any other information related to the infrastructure of the public utility
16 that the Commission may require by regulation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which provide
3 simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of rates for those public
4 utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, to
5 persons within this State for compensation, and which:
6 (a) Serve 3,000 or fewer persons; and

Senate Amendment No. 241 to Senate Bill No. 326 Page 4
1 (b) Had during the immediately preceding 12-month period gross sales for
2 water or services for the disposal of sewage amounting to $2,000,000 or less. If a
3 public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its gross
4 sales for each service must be considered separately for determining whether the
5 public utility qualifies under this paragraph for either service.
6 2. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to subsection 1 must
7 provide, without limitation, for the filing of letters of advice to change rates based
8 on a nationally recognized inflation index approved by the Commission.
9 3. A public utility described in subsection 1 which is located in a county
10 whose population is 700,000 or more and which serves at least 250 persons shall,
11 each year on or before a date established by the Commission, submit to the
12 Commission a report that includes, without limitation:
13 (a) Information concerning the [condition] adequacy of the infrastructure of
14 the public utility, including, without limitation, the adequacy of the infrastructure
15 to furnish a reasonably adequate supply of water for fire protection as required
16 by NRS 704.660 and the sufficiency and availability of any water rights that are
17 necessary to provide service; and
18 (b) Any other information related to the infrastructure of the public utility
19 that the Commission may require by regulation.
