AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring certain public utilities

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
2 regulations which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
3 rates for public utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage,
4 or both, to persons within this State for compensation, and which: (1) serve 3,000
5 or fewer persons; and (2) had gross sales for water or services for the disposal of
6 sewage, considered separately, amounting to $2,000,000 or less for the immediately
7 preceding 12-month period. (NRS 704.095) This bill requires such a public utility
8 to submit an annual report to the Commission relating to the infrastructure of the
9 public utility if the public utility is located in a county whose population is 700,000
10 or more (currently only Clark County) and the public utility serves at least 250
11 persons. This bill requires the report to be submitted each year on or before a date
12 established by the Commission and to include, without limitation: (1) information
13 concerning the condition of the infrastructure of the public utility, including,
14 without limitation, the sufficiency and availability of any water rights that are
15 necessary to provide service; and (2) any other information related to the
16 infrastructure of the public utility that the Commission may require by regulation.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which
3 provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
4 rates for those public utilities which furnish water or services for the
5 disposal of sewage, or both, to persons within this State for
6 compensation, and which:

8 (b) Had during the immediately preceding 12-month period
9 gross sales for water or services for the disposal of sewage
10 amounting to $2,000,000 or less. If a public utility furnishes both
11 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its gross sales for
12 each service must be considered separately for determining whether
13 the public utility qualifies under this paragraph for either service.
14 2. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
15 subsection 1 must provide, without limitation, for the filing of letters
16 of advice to change rates based on a nationally recognized inflation
17 index approved by the Commission.
18 3. A public utility described in subsection 1 which is located
19 in a county whose population is 700,000 or more and which serves
20 at least 250 persons shall, each year on or before a date
21 established by the Commission, submit to the Commission a report
22 that includes, without limitation:
23 (a) Information concerning the condition of the infrastructure
24 of the public utility, including, without limitation, the sufficiency
25 and availability of any water rights that are necessary to provide

28 public utility that the Commission may require by regulation.
