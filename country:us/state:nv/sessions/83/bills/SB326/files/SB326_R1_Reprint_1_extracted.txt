2 regulations which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
3 rates for public utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage,
4 or both, to persons within this State for compensation, and which: (1) serve 3,000
5 or fewer persons; and (2) had gross sales for water or services for the disposal of
6 sewage, considered separately, amounting to $2,000,000 or less for the immediately
7 preceding 12-month period. (NRS 704.095) This bill requires such a public utility
8 to submit an annual report to the Commission relating to the infrastructure of the
9 public utility if the public utility is located in a county whose population is 700,000
10 or more (currently only Clark County) and the public utility serves at least 250
11 persons. This bill requires the report to be submitted each year on or before a date
12 established by the Commission and to include, without limitation: (1) information
13 concerning the adequacy of the infrastructure of the public utility, including,
14 without limitation, the adequacy of the infrastructure to furnish a reasonably
15 adequate supply of water for fire protection and the sufficiency and availability of
16 any water rights that are necessary to provide service; and (2) any other information
17 related to the infrastructure of the public utility that the Commission may require by
18 regulation.

1 Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which
3 provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
4 rates for those public utilities which furnish water or services for the
5 disposal of sewage, or both, to persons within this State for

13 the public utility qualifies under this paragraph for either service.
14 2. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
15 subsection 1 must provide, without limitation, for the filing of letters
16 of advice to change rates based on a nationally recognized inflation
17 index approved by the Commission.
