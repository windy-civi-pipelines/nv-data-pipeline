Senate Bill No. 326–Senator Cruz-Crawford
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring certain public utilities
to submit to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada an
annual report relating to the infrastructure of the public
utility; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
regulations which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
rates for public utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage,
or both, to persons within this State for compensation, and which: (1) serve 3,000
or fewer persons; and (2) had gross sales for water or services for the disposal of
sewage, considered separately, amounting to $2,000,000 or less for the immediately
preceding 12-month period. (NRS 704.095) This bill requires such a public utility
to submit an annual report to the Commission relating to the infrastructure of the
public utility if the public utility is located in a county whose population is 700,000
or more (currently only Clark County) and the public utility serves at least 250
persons. This bill requires the report to be submitted each year on or before a date
established by the Commission and to include, without limitation: (1) information
concerning the adequacy of the infrastructure of the public utility, including,
without limitation, the adequacy of the infrastructure to furnish a reasonably
adequate supply of water for fire protection and the sufficiency and availability of
any water rights that are necessary to provide service; and (2) any other information
related to the infrastructure of the public utility that the Commission may require by
regulation.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which
provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
rates for those public utilities which furnish water or services for the
disposal of sewage, or both, to persons within this State for
compensation, and which:
(a) Serve 3,000 or fewer persons; and
(b) Had during the immediately preceding 12-month period
gross sales for water or services for the disposal of sewage
amounting to $2,000,000 or less. If a public utility furnishes both
water and services for the disposal of sewage, its gross sales for
each service must be considered separately for determining whether
the public utility qualifies under this paragraph for either service.
