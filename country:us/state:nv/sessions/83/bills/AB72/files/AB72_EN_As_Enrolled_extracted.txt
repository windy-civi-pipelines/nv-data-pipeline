Section 1:
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State
to adopt a code of professional responsibility for notaries
public; authorizing a notarial officer to refuse to perform a
notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the
procedure for filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering
document preparation services; prohibiting a registrant to
engage in the business of a document preparation service
from engaging in such business for or under an entity that is
not covered by such a bond; providing that certain
information and documents obtained during an investigation
of a document preparation service is confidential; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1)
prescribing the procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary
public; and (2) establishing procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic
signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes the
Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a code of professional
responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries
public, including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility
adopted pursuant to section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who
willfully violates such a code would be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable
harm results. (NRS 240.175)
Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3
of this bill authorizes a notarial officer to refuse to perform a notarial act if the
notary officer is not satisfied that: (1) the person executing the document is
competent or has capacity to execute the document; or (2) the persons signature is
not knowingly and voluntarily made. Section 3 further authorizes a notarial officer
to refuse to perform a notarial act under other circumstances where such refusal is
not prohibited.
Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic
notarial acts using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is
physically present in the State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill
clarifies that an electronic notary public is prohibited from performing an electronic
notarial act unless he or she is present in the State. Under existing law, the
Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a notary public
who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to
indemnify persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS
240A.120) However, existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or
more employees who perform document preparation services to file such a bond on
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
behalf of all such employees; and (2) exempts the employees of a business entity
that files such a bond from the requirement to file their own bonds. (NRS
240A.123) Sections 5.3-5.7 of this bill authorize a registrant who performs
document preparation services under more than one business entity to file one bond
for each such business entity and establish the amount of such a bond on the
number of business entities under which the registrant performs document
preparation services. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to allow a
registrant to perform document preparation services under multiple entities under
one bond. Sections 9 and 9.5 of this bill authorize a business entity to file such a
bond on behalf of its independent contractors who provide document preparation
services.

Section 2:
Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or renewal of
registration as a document preparation service to provide a list of each entity under
which the applicant intends to perform document preparation services during the
following calendar year. Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging
in the business of a document preparation service for or under any entity for which
a bond has not been filed. Under existing law, a registrant who violates that
prohibition would be subject to certain administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270)
Additionally, a registrant who willfully violates that prohibition is subject to certain
criminal penalties. (NRS 240A.290)
Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be
conducted an investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a
provision of law, regulation or order relating to document preparation services has
been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections 1 and 11 of this bill make information
and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary of State in connection with
an investigation confidential.

Section 57:
3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.

Section 58:
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic

(a) The public record:
(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:

medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself

Sec. 9.7. NRS 240A.127 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
240A.127 1. A claim against a bond filed pursuant to NRS
240A.120 or 240A.123 or section 5.5 of this act may be filed in a
court of competent jurisdiction for damages to the extent covered by
the bond. A claim may not be brought against a bond after 3 years
from the date of the act on which the action is based.

Section 114:
2. If a person commences an action pursuant to subsection 1,
he or she must notify the Secretary of State in writing upon filing
the action. Upon receiving such notification, the Secretary of State
shall notify the person:
(a) Whether the bond is in effect;
(b) The amount of the bond; and
(c) If there is any other claim against the bond, the title, court
and case number of the action and the amount sought by the plaintiff
in the other action.

Section 115:
3. If a surety wishes to make payment without awaiting action
by a court:
(a) The amount of the bond must be reduced to the extent of any
payment made by the surety in good faith under the bond; and
(b) Any payment must be based on written claims received by
the surety before any action is taken by a court.

Section 116:
4. A surety may bring an action for interpleader against all
claimants upon the bond. If such an action for interpleader is
brought, the surety:
(a) Shall publish notice of the action at least once each week for
2 weeks in every issue of a newspaper of general circulation in the
county of the principal place of business of the registrant or business
entity, as applicable; and
(b) May deduct its costs of the action, including, without
limitation, costs for attorney’s fees and publication, from its liability
under the bond.

Section 117:
5. Claims against a bond have equal priority. If a bond is
insufficient to pay all claims in full, the claims must be paid on a pro
rata basis. Any claimant may bring action against the registrant or
business entity, as applicable, for the unpaid balance of a claim.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 72–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State
to adopt a code of professional responsibility for notaries
public; authorizing a notarial officer to refuse to perform a
notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the
procedure for filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering
document preparation services; prohibiting a registrant to
engage in the business of a document preparation service
from engaging in such business for or under an entity that is
not covered by such a bond; providing that certain
information and documents obtained during an investigation
of a document preparation service is confidential; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1)
prescribing the procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary
public; and (2) establishing procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic
signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes the
Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a code of professional
responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries
public, including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility
adopted pursuant to section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who
willfully violates such a code would be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable
harm results. (NRS 240.175)
Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3
of this bill authorizes a notarial officer to refuse to perform a notarial act if the
notary officer is not satisfied that: (1) the person executing the document is
competent or has capacity to execute the document; or (2) the persons signature is
not knowingly and voluntarily made. Section 3 further authorizes a notarial officer
to refuse to perform a notarial act under other circumstances where such refusal is
not prohibited.
Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic
notarial acts using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is
physically present in the State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill
clarifies that an electronic notary public is prohibited from performing an electronic
notarial act unless he or she is present in the State. Under existing law, the
Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a notary public
who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to
indemnify persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS
240A.120) However, existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or
more employees who perform document preparation services to file such a bond on
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
behalf of all such employees; and (2) exempts the employees of a business entity
that files such a bond from the requirement to file their own bonds. (NRS
240A.123) Sections 5.3-5.7 of this bill authorize a registrant who performs
document preparation services under more than one business entity to file one bond
for each such business entity and establish the amount of such a bond on the
number of business entities under which the registrant performs document
preparation services. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to allow a
registrant to perform document preparation services under multiple entities under
one bond. Sections 9 and 9.5 of this bill authorize a business entity to file such a
bond on behalf of its independent contractors who provide document preparation
services.
Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or renewal of
registration as a document preparation service to provide a list of each entity under
which the applicant intends to perform document preparation services during the
following calendar year. Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging
in the business of a document preparation service for or under any entity for which
a bond has not been filed. Under existing law, a registrant who violates that
prohibition would be subject to certain administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270)
Additionally, a registrant who willfully violates that prohibition is subject to certain
criminal penalties. (NRS 240A.290)
Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be
conducted an investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a
provision of law, regulation or order relating to document preparation services has
been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections 1 and 11 of this bill make information
and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary of State in connection with
an investigation confidential.

federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium if:
(a) The public record:
(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:
(1) Give access to proprietary software; or
(2) Require the production of information that is confidential
and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
or herself.

240.017 The Secretary of State:
1. May adopt regulations:

[11.] (k) Affix his or her stamp to any document which does not
contain a notarial certificate.
2. A notarial officer may refuse to perform a notarial act if
the notarial officer is not satisfied that:

notary public appointed pursuant to the authority of this State may
act, either by the law of this State or of another state, territory or
country, or by the law of nations, or by commercial usage, the

injured thereby, for all the damages sustained.
2. The employer of a notary public may be assessed a civil
penalty by the Secretary of State of not more than $2,000 for each

with a complaint which alleges a violation of this chapter.
4. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, for any willful
violation or neglect of duty or other violation of this chapter [,] or
any regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or upon proof that a

240A.260 1. If the Secretary of State obtains information that
a provision of this chapter or a regulation or order adopted or issued

the registration of the registrant.
3. If, after investigation, the Secretary of State determines that
a violation has occurred, the Secretary of State may:
(a) Serve, by certified mail addressed to the person who has

Secretary of State shall afford any person upon whom such a penalty
is imposed an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the provisions of
NRS 233B.121.
(c) If a person engaged in the business of a document
preparation service and was not a registrant at the time of the

district attorney for commencement of a civil action against the
person pursuant to NRS 240A.280.

district attorney for prosecution of the person pursuant to
NRS 240A.290.
(f) Take any combination of the actions described in this
subsection.

document preparation service, a person applying for registration as a
document preparation service or a person who is engaging in the
business of a document preparation service and is not registered by
the Secretary of State pursuant to this chapter may file a complaint
with the Secretary of State setting forth the details of the violation
that are known by the person who is filing the complaint.
5. If the Secretary of State receives a complaint alleging a
violation of this chapter, the Secretary of State shall notify the

for the commencement of a civil action or prosecution pursuant to

section 9 of this act, a business entity files with the Secretary of
State a cash bond or surety bond on behalf of an independent

not required to file any other cash bond or surety bond with the
Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 240A.120, as amended by

effective date of section 8 of this act.
(b) Allow the release of a surety bond filed by the independent
contractor pursuant to NRS 240A.120, as that section existed before
