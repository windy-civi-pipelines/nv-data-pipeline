AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State to adopt a
code of professional responsibility for notaries public; [prohibiting a
notary public from performing a notarial act under certain
circumstances;] authorizing a notarial officer to refuse to perform a
notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the procedure for
filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering document preparation
services; prohibiting a registrant to engage in the business of a
document preparation service from engaging in such business for or
under an entity that is not covered by such a bond; providing that
certain information and documents obtained during an investigation of
a document preparation service is confidential; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1) prescribing the
2 procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary public; and (2) establishing
3 procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2
4 of this bill additionally authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a
5 code of professional responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the
6 Secretary of State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
7 regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries public,
8 including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility adopted pursuant to
9 section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who willfully violates such a code would
10 be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable harm results. (NRS 240.175)
11 Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3 of this
12 bill [additionally prohibits] authorizes a [notary public from performing] notarial officer to
13 refuse to perform a notarial act if the notary [public has reason to believe that the person
14 whose signature is to be acknowledged, sworn to or witnessed or attested does not know or
Assembly Amendment No. 229 to Assembly Bill No. 72 Page 4
15 understand the act he or she is performing or the effect of that act. Under existing law, a
16 person who violates that prohibition would be subject to administrative sanctions. Under
17 existing law, if a person willfully violates that prohibition and irreparable harm results, the
18 person would be guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 240.175)] officer is not satisfied that:
19 (1) the person executing the document is competent or has capacity to execute the
20 document; or (2) the persons signature is not knowingly and voluntarily made. Section 3
21 further authorizes a notarial officer to refuse to perform a notarial act under other
22 circumstances where such refusal is not prohibited.
23 Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic notarial acts
24 using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is physically present in the
25 State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill clarifies that an electronic notary public
26 is prohibited from performing an electronic notarial act unless he or she is present in the State.
27 Under existing law, the Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a
28 notary public who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
29 Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
30 preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to indemnify
31 persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS 240A.120) However,
32 existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or more employees who perform
33 document preparation services to file such a bond on behalf of all such employees; and (2)
34 exempts the employees of a business entity that files such a bond from the requirement to file
35 their own bonds. (NRS 240A.123) Section 5.3-5.7 of this bill authorize a registrant who
36 performs document preparation services under more than one business entity to file one
37 bond for each such business entity and establish the amount of such a bond on the
38 number of business entities under which the registrant performs document preparation
39 services. Section 8 of this bill [requires each registrant who files a bond on behalf of himself
40 or herself to file a separate bond for each entity under which he or she performs document
41 preparation services, thereby prohibiting such] makes a conforming change to allow a
42 registrant [from performing] to perform document preparation services [for] under multiple
43 entities under one bond. [Section] Sections 9 and 9.5 of this bill [removes the discretion for a
44 business entity that employs one or more persons who provide document preparation services
45 to not file a cash or surety bond on behalf of such employees if each employee instead files
46 such a bond on his or her own behalf. Section 9 thereby requires each such] authorize a
47 business entity to file such a bond on behalf of its [employees,] independent contractors
48 who provide document preparation services.
49 Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or renewal of
50 registration as a document preparation service to provide [: (1)] a list of each entity under
51 which the applicant intends to [provide] perform document preparation services [; and (2) for
52 each such entity, proof that the required bond has been filed.] during the following calendar
53 year. Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging in the business of a document
54 preparation service for or under any entity for which a bond has not been filed. Under
55 existing law, a registrant who violates that prohibition would be subject to certain
56 administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270) Additionally, a registrant who willfully violates
57 that prohibition [or a business entity that willfully fails to file a bond where required by
58 section 9] is subject to certain criminal penalties. (NRS 240A.290)
59 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be conducted an
60 investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a provision of law, regulation or
61 order relating to document preparation services has been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections
62 1 and 11 of this bill make information and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary
63 of State in connection with an investigation confidential.

18 set forth in NRS 240A.125.
19 2. If a business entity files a cash bond or surety bond pursuant to subsection
20 1, the employees and independent contractors of the business entity who are
21 covered by the bond are not required to file a cash bond or surety bond pursuant to
22 NRS 240A.120 [.] with respect to documentation preparation services provided
23 for that business entity.
24 3. A cash or surety bond filed pursuant to subsection 1 must be approved as to
25 form by the Attorney General and conditioned to provide:
26 (a) Indemnification to a client or any other person who is determined in an
27 action or proceeding to have suffered damage as a result of:
28 (1) An act or omission of a registrant employed or contracted by the
29 business entity which violates a provision of this chapter or a regulation or order
30 adopted or issued pursuant thereto;
31 (2) A wrongful failure or refusal by a registrant employed or contracted by
32 the business entity to provide services in accordance with a contract entered into
33 pursuant to NRS 240A.190;
34 (3) The fraud, dishonesty, negligence or other wrongful conduct of a
35 registrant employed or contracted by the business entity; or
36 (4) An act or omission of a registrant employed or contracted by the
37 business entity in violation of any other federal or state law for which the return of
38 fees, an award of damages or the imposition of sanctions have been awarded by a
39 court of competent jurisdiction in this State; or
40 (b) Payment to the Secretary of State for any civil penalty or award of
41 attorney’s fees or costs of suit owing and unpaid by a registrant employed or
42 contracted by the business entity to the Secretary of State pursuant to this chapter.
43 4. No part of a bond filed pursuant to this section may be withdrawn while the
44 registration of a registrant employed or contracted by the business entity remains in
45 effect, or while a proceeding to suspend or revoke the registration is pending.
46 5. If a surety bond is filed pursuant to subsection 1:
47 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the bond must be executed by
48 the business entity as principal and by a surety company qualified and authorized to
49 do business in this State.
50 (b) The bond must cover the period of registration of each employee and
51 independent contractor of the business entity who is registered as a document
52 preparation service and performs document preparation services for the business
53 entity, except when the surety is released in accordance with this section.
Assembly Amendment No. 229 to Assembly Bill No. 72 Page 15
1 (c) The surety shall pay any final, nonappealable judgment of a court of this
2 State that has jurisdiction, upon receipt of written notice that the judgment is final.
3 (d) The bond may be continuous, but regardless of the duration of the bond, the
4 aggregate liability of the surety does not exceed the penal sum of the bond.
5 (e) If the penal sum of the bond is exhausted, the surety shall give written
6 notice to the Secretary of State and the business entity within 30 days after its
7 exhaustion.
8 (f) The surety may be released after giving 30 days’ written notice to the
9 Secretary of State and the business entity, but the release does not discharge or
10 otherwise affect any claim resulting from an act or omission which is alleged to
11 have occurred while the bond was in effect.
12 6. If a business entity employs or contracts with only one registrant to
13 perform document preparation services, the registrant must be named as principal in
14 the bond filed pursuant to this section.
15 7. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a cash bond is filed
16 pursuant to subsection 1, the Secretary of State may retain the bond until the
17 expiration of 3 years after the date the business entity has ceased to do business, or
18 3 years after the date of the expiration or revocation of the registration of each
19 employee and independent contractor of the business entity who is registered as a
20 document preparation service and performs document preparation services for the
21 business entity, to ensure that there are no outstanding claims against the bond. A
22 court of competent jurisdiction may order the return of the bond, or any part of the
23 bond, at an earlier date upon evidence satisfactory to the court that there are no
24 outstanding claims against the bond or that the part of the bond retained by the
25 Secretary of State is sufficient to satisfy any outstanding claims. Interest on a cash
26 bond filed pursuant to subsection 1 must accrue to the account of the depositor.
27 8. The registration of a registrant is suspended by operation of law when the
28 registrant is no longer covered by a bond or the penal sum of the bond is exhausted.
29 If the Secretary of State receives notice pursuant to subsection 5 that the penal sum
30 of a surety bond is exhausted or that the surety is being released, the Secretary of
31 State shall immediately notify the business entity and each registrant covered under
32 the bond in writing that their registration is suspended by operation of law until
33 another bond is filed in the same manner and amount as the former bond.
34 9. The Secretary of State may reinstate the registration of a registrant whose
35 registration has been suspended pursuant to subsection 8 if, before the current term
36 of the registration expires, the business entity files with the Secretary of State a new
37 bond meeting the requirements of this section or the registrant files with the
38 Secretary of State a new bond meeting the requirements of NRS 240A.120 [.] or
39 section 5.5 of this act. A registrant who files a new bond pursuant to NRS
40 240A.120 or section 5.5 of this act shall not provide document preparation
41 services for a business entity that is subject to the requirements of this section but
42 has not filed a bond pursuant to subsection 1.
43 10. Except as specifically authorized or required by this chapter, a business
44 entity or registrant shall not make or cause to be made any oral or written reference
45 to the registrant’s compliance with the requirements of this section.
46 Sec. 9.5. NRS 240A.125 is hereby amended to read as follows:
47 240A.125 1. A bond filed by a business entity pursuant to NRS 240A.123
48 on behalf of the employees and independent contractors of the business entity who
49 are registered as a document preparation service must be in the penal sum of:
50 (a) If the business entity employs or contracts with 1 registrant to perform
51 document preparation services, $25,000;
52 (b) If the business entity employs or contracts with at least 2 but not more than
53 25 registrants to perform document preparation services, $50,000;
Assembly Amendment No. 229 to Assembly Bill No. 72 Page 16
1 (c) If the business entity employs or contracts with at least 26 but not more
2 than 75 registrants to perform document preparation services, $75,000;
3 (d) If the business entity employs or contracts with at least 76 but not more
4 than 125 registrants to perform document preparation services, $100,000;
5 (e) If the business entity employs or contracts with at least 126 but not more
6 than 200 registrants to perform document preparation services, $150,000; and
7 (f) If the business entity employs or contracts with more than 200 registrants
8 to perform document preparation services, $200,000.
9 2. For purposes of determining the amount of the bond required pursuant to
10 subsection 1, the number of registrants employed or contracted by a business entity
11 to perform document preparation services is the greatest number of registrants who
12 will perform document preparation services for the business entity at any time
13 during the year, including, without limitation, on a temporary or seasonal basis.
14 Sec. 9.7. NRS 240A.127 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 240A.127 1. A claim against a bond filed pursuant to NRS 240A.120 or
16 240A.123 or section 5.5 of this act may be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction
17 for damages to the extent covered by the bond. A claim may not be brought against
18 a bond after 3 years from the date of the act on which the action is based.
19 2. If a person commences an action pursuant to subsection 1, he or she must
20 notify the Secretary of State in writing upon filing the action. Upon receiving such
21 notification, the Secretary of State shall notify the person:
22 (a) Whether the bond is in effect;
23 (b) The amount of the bond; and
24 (c) If there is any other claim against the bond, the title, court and case number
25 of the action and the amount sought by the plaintiff in the other action.
26 3. If a surety wishes to make payment without awaiting action by a court:
27 (a) The amount of the bond must be reduced to the extent of any payment
28 made by the surety in good faith under the bond; and
29 (b) Any payment must be based on written claims received by the surety before
30 any action is taken by a court.
31 4. A surety may bring an action for interpleader against all claimants upon the
32 bond. If such an action for interpleader is brought, the surety:
33 (a) Shall publish notice of the action at least once each week for 2 weeks in
34 every issue of a newspaper of general circulation in the county of the principal
35 place of business of the registrant or business entity, as applicable; and
36 (b) May deduct its costs of the action, including, without limitation, costs for
37 attorney’s fees and publication, from its liability under the bond.
38 5. Claims against a bond have equal priority. If a bond is insufficient to pay
39 all claims in full, the claims must be paid on a pro rata basis. Any claimant may
40 bring action against the registrant or business entity, as applicable, for the unpaid
41 balance of a claim.
42 Sec. 10. NRS 240A.240 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 240A.240 1. A registrant shall not:
44 (a) After the date of the last service performed for a client, retain any fees or
45 costs for services not performed or costs not incurred.
46 (b) Make, orally or in writing:
47 (1) A promise of the result to be obtained by the filing or submission of
48 any document, unless the registrant has some basis in fact for making the promise;
49 (2) A statement that the registrant has some special influence with or is
50 able to obtain special treatment from the court or agency with which a document is
51 to be filed or submitted; or
Assembly Amendment No. 229 to Assembly Bill No. 72 Page 17
1 (3) A false or misleading statement to a client if the registrant knows that
2 the statement is false or misleading or knows that the registrant lacks a sufficient
3 basis for making the statement.
4 (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, in any advertisement or
5 written description of the registrant or the services provided by the registrant, or on
6 any letterhead or business card of the registrant, use the term “legal aid,” “legal
7 services,” “law office,” “notario,” “notario publico,” “notary public,” “notary,”
8 “paralegal,” “legal assistant,” “licensed,” “licenciado,” “attorney,” “lawyer” or any
9 similar term, in English, Spanish or any other language, which implies that the
10 registrant:
11 (1) Offers services without charge if the registrant does not do so;
12 (2) Is an attorney authorized to practice law in this State; or
13 (3) Is acting under the direction and supervision of an attorney.
14 (d) Represent himself or herself, orally or in writing, as a paralegal or legal
15 assistant which implies that the registrant is acting under the direction and
16 supervision of an attorney licensed to practice law in this State.
17 (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, negotiate with another person
18 concerning the rights or responsibilities of a client, communicate the position of a
19 client to another person or convey the position of another person to a client.
20 (f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, appear on behalf of a client in
21 a court proceeding or other formal adjudicative proceeding, unless the registrant is
22 ordered to appear by the court or presiding officer.
23 (g) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, provide any advice,
24 explanation, opinion or recommendation to a client about possible legal rights,
25 remedies, defenses, options or the selection of documents or strategies, except that
26 a registrant may provide to a client published factual information, written or
27 approved by an attorney, relating to legal procedures, rights or obligations.
28 (h) Engage in the business of a document preparation service as an employee
29 or independent contractor for an entity that is not covered by a cash bond or
30 surety bond filed pursuant to NRS [240A.120 or] 240A.123 [.] or under a sole
31 proprietorship or business entity unless the registrant is covered by a cash bond
32 or surety bond filed pursuant to section 5.5 of this act.
33 (i) Seek or obtain from a client a waiver of any provision of this chapter. Any
34 such waiver is contrary to public policy and void.
35 2. The provisions of paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of subsection 1 do not apply to
36 a registrant to the extent that compliance with such provisions would violate federal
37 law.
38 3. A registrant who is also a notary public appointed by the Secretary of State
39 pursuant to chapter 240 of NRS and in good standing with the Secretary of State
40 may, in any advertisement or written description of the registrant or the services
41 provided by the registrant, use the term “notary public.”
42 4. If the Secretary of State finds a registrant in violation of the provisions of
43 subsection 1, the Secretary of State may:
44 (a) Suspend the registration of the registrant for not less than 1 year.
45 (b) Revoke the registration of the registrant for a third or subsequent offense.
46 (c) Assess a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation.
47 Sec. 11. NRS 240A.260 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 240A.260 1. If the Secretary of State obtains information that a provision of
49 this chapter or a regulation or order adopted or issued pursuant thereto has been
50 violated by a registrant or another person, the Secretary of State may conduct or
51 cause to be conducted an investigation of the alleged violation.
52 2. If, within a reasonable period of time, a registrant fails to provide the
53 Secretary of State with any information requested by the Secretary of State during
Assembly Amendment No. 229 to Assembly Bill No. 72 Page 18
1 an investigation of an alleged violation by the registrant, the Secretary of State may
2 suspend or refuse to renew the registration of the registrant.
3 3. If, after investigation, the Secretary of State determines that a violation has
4 occurred, the Secretary of State may:
5 (a) Serve, by certified mail addressed to the person who has committed the
6 violation, a written order directing the person to cease and desist from the conduct
7 constituting the violation. The order must notify the person that any willful
8 violation of the order may subject the person to prosecution and criminal penalties
9 pursuant to NRS 240A.290 and penalties pursuant to this section and NRS
10 240A.280.
11 (b) If a registrant has committed the violation:
12 (1) Revoke or suspend the registration of the registrant; or
13 (2) Impose a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation. The
14 authority of the Secretary of State to impose a penalty applies regardless of whether
15 the person is still a registrant at the time that the penalty is imposed so long as the
16 person was a registrant at the time that he or she committed the violation. The
17 Secretary of State shall afford any person upon whom such a penalty is imposed an
18 opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the provisions of NRS 233B.121.
19 (c) If a person engaged in the business of a document preparation service and
20 was not a registrant at the time of the violation, after a hearing on the matter,
21 impose a penalty for each violation of not more than $5,000 or the amount of
22 economic benefit derived from the violation, whichever is greater.
23 (d) Refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General or a district attorney for
24 commencement of a civil action against the person pursuant to NRS 240A.280.
25 (e) Refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General or a district attorney for
26 prosecution of the person pursuant to NRS 240A.290.
27 (f) Take any combination of the actions described in this subsection.
28 4. Any person who is aware of a violation of this chapter by a document
29 preparation service, a person applying for registration as a document preparation
30 service or a person who is engaging in the business of a document preparation
31 service and is not registered by the Secretary of State pursuant to this chapter may
32 file a complaint with the Secretary of State setting forth the details of the violation
33 that are known by the person who is filing the complaint.
34 5. If the Secretary of State receives a complaint alleging a violation of this
35 chapter, the Secretary of State shall notify the document preparation service or
36 other person who is the subject of the complaint. The notice:

51 or a regulation or order adopted or issued pursuant thereto has been violated by a
52 registrant or another person and the imposition of any penalty by the Secretary of
53 State pursuant to this section is a public record.

1 7. Except as otherwise necessary to refer an alleged violation for the
2 commencement of a civil action or prosecution pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e),
3 respectively, of subsection 3, information and documents obtained by or filed with
4 the Secretary of State in connection with an investigation concerning a possible
5 violation of this chapter are not public information and are confidential.
6 Sec. 12. 1. If, pursuant to NRS 240A.123, as amended by section 9 of this
7 act, a business entity files with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond on
8 behalf of an [employee] independent contractor of the business entity and the
9 [employee] independent contractor is not required to file any other cash bond or
10 surety bond with the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 240A.120, as amended by
11 section 8 of this act, [or] 240A.123, as amended by section 9 of this act, or section
12 5.5 of this act, the Secretary of State shall:
13 (a) Return a cash bond filed by the [employee] independent contractor
14 pursuant to NRS 240A.120, as that section existed before the effective date of
15 section 8 of this act.
16 (b) Allow the release of a surety bond filed by the [employee] independent
17 contractor pursuant to NRS 240A.120, as that section existed before the effective
18 date of section 8 of this act.
19 2. As used in this section, “business entity” has the meaning ascribed to it in
20 NRS 240A.015.
21 Sec. 13. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
22 2. Sections 1, 3, 5 and 11 of this act become effective on October 1, 2025.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State to adopt a
code of professional responsibility for notaries public; [prohibiting a
notary public from performing a notarial act under certain
circumstances;] authorizing a notarial officer to refuse to perform a
notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the procedure for
filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering document preparation
services; prohibiting a registrant to engage in the business of a
document preparation service from engaging in such business for or
under an entity that is not covered by such a bond; providing that
certain information and documents obtained during an investigation of
a document preparation service is confidential; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1) prescribing the
2 procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary public; and (2) establishing
3 procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2
4 of this bill additionally authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a
5 code of professional responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the
6 Secretary of State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
7 regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries public,
8 including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility adopted pursuant to
9 section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who willfully violates such a code would
10 be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable harm results. (NRS 240.175)
11 Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3 of this
12 bill [additionally prohibits] authorizes a [notary public from performing] notarial officer to
13 refuse to perform a notarial act if the notary [public has reason to believe that the person
14 whose signature is to be acknowledged, sworn to or witnessed or attested does not know or

Assembly Amendment No. 229 to Assembly Bill No. 72 Page 4
15 understand the act he or she is performing or the effect of that act. Under existing law, a
16 person who violates that prohibition would be subject to administrative sanctions. Under
17 existing law, if a person willfully violates that prohibition and irreparable harm results, the
18 person would be guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 240.175)] officer is not satisfied that:
19 (1) the person executing the document is competent or has capacity to execute the
20 document; or (2) the persons signature is not knowingly and voluntarily made. Section 3
21 further authorizes a notarial officer to refuse to perform a notarial act under other
22 circumstances where such refusal is not prohibited.
23 Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic notarial acts
24 using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is physically present in the
25 State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill clarifies that an electronic notary public
26 is prohibited from performing an electronic notarial act unless he or she is present in the State.
27 Under existing law, the Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a
28 notary public who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
29 Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
30 preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to indemnify
31 persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS 240A.120) However,
32 existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or more employees who perform
33 document preparation services to file such a bond on behalf of all such employees; and (2)
34 exempts the employees of a business entity that files such a bond from the requirement to file
35 their own bonds. (NRS 240A.123) Section 5.3-5.7 of this bill authorize a registrant who
36 performs document preparation services under more than one business entity to file one
37 bond for each such business entity and establish the amount of such a bond on the
38 number of business entities under which the registrant performs document preparation
39 services. Section 8 of this bill [requires each registrant who files a bond on behalf of himself
40 or herself to file a separate bond for each entity under which he or she performs document
41 preparation services, thereby prohibiting such] makes a conforming change to allow a
42 registrant [from performing] to perform document preparation services [for] under multiple
43 entities under one bond. [Section] Sections 9 and 9.5 of this bill [removes the discretion for a
44 business entity that employs one or more persons who provide document preparation services
45 to not file a cash or surety bond on behalf of such employees if each employee instead files
46 such a bond on his or her own behalf. Section 9 thereby requires each such] authorize a
47 business entity to file such a bond on behalf of its [employees,] independent contractors
48 who provide document preparation services.
49 Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or renewal of
50 registration as a document preparation service to provide [: (1)] a list of each entity under
51 which the applicant intends to [provide] perform document preparation services [; and (2) for
52 each such entity, proof that the required bond has been filed.] during the following calendar
53 year. Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging in the business of a document
54 preparation service for or under any entity for which a bond has not been filed. Under
55 existing law, a registrant who violates that prohibition would be subject to certain
56 administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270) Additionally, a registrant who willfully violates
57 that prohibition [or a business entity that willfully fails to file a bond where required by
58 section 9] is subject to certain criminal penalties. (NRS 240A.290)
59 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be conducted an
60 investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a provision of law, regulation or
61 order relating to document preparation services has been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections
62 1 and 11 of this bill make information and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary
63 of State in connection with an investigation confidential.

46 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
47 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
48 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an

37 bond meeting the requirements of this section or the registrant files with the
