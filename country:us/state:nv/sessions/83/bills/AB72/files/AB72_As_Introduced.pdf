AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State
to adopt a code of professional responsibility for notaries
public; prohibiting a notary public from performing a
notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the
procedure for filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering

from engaging in such business for an entity that is not

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1)
2 prescribing the procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary
3 public; and (2) establishing procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic
4 signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes the
5 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a code of professional
6 responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
7 State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
8 regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries

9 public, including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility
10 adopted pursuant to section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who
11 willfully violates such a code would be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable
12 harm results. (NRS 240.175)
13 Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3
14 of this bill additionally prohibits a notary public from performing a notarial act if
15 the notary public has reason to believe that the person whose signature is to be
16 acknowledged, sworn to or witnessed or attested does not know or understand the
17 act he or she is performing or the effect of that act. Under existing law, a person
18 who violates that prohibition would be subject to administrative sanctions. Under
19 existing law, if a person willfully violates that prohibition and irreparable harm
20 results, the person would be guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 240.175)
21 Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic
22 notarial acts using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is
23 physically present in the State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill
24 clarifies that an electronic notary public is prohibited from performing an electronic
25 notarial act unless he or she is present in the State. Under existing law, the
26 Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a notary public
27 who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
28 Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
29 preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to
30 indemnify persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS
31 240A.120) However, existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or
32 more employees who perform document preparation services to file such a bond on
33 behalf of all such employees; and (2) exempts the employees of a business entity
34 that files such a bond from the requirement to file their own bonds. (NRS
35 240A.123) Section 8 of this bill requires each registrant who files a bond on behalf
36 of himself or herself to file a separate bond for each entity under which he or she
37 performs document preparation services, thereby prohibiting such a registrant from
38 performing document preparation services for multiple entities under one bond.
39 Section 9 of this bill removes the discretion for a business entity that employs one
40 or more persons who provide document preparation services to not file a cash or
41 surety bond on behalf of such employees if each employee instead files such a bond
42 on his or her own behalf. Section 9 thereby requires each such business entity to
43 file such a bond on behalf of its employees, who provide document preparation
44 services. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or
45 renewal of registration as a document preparation service to provide: (1) a list of
46 each entity under which the applicant intends to provide document preparation
47 services; and (2) for each such entity, proof that the required bond has been filed.
48 Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging in the business of a
49 document preparation service for any entity for which a bond has not been filed.
50 Under existing law, a registrant who violates that prohibition would be subject to
51 certain administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270) Additionally, a registrant who
52 willfully violates that prohibition or a business entity that willfully fails to file a
53 bond where required by section 9 is subject to certain criminal penalties.
54 (NRS 240A.290)
55 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be
56 conducted an investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a
57 provision of law, regulation or order relating to document preparation services has
58 been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections 1 and 11 of this bill make information
59 and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary of State in connection with
60 an investigation confidential.

5 711.600, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada
6 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
7 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books
8 and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all
9 times during office hours to inspection by any person, and may be
10 fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be prepared from
11 those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
12 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
13 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other
14 way to the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general
15 public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the
16 federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
17 any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
18 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
19 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
20 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
21 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
22 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
23 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
24 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
25 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
26 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
27 electronically, the confidential information from the information
28 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
29 confidential.
30 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
31 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
32 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
33 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
34 means of an electronic medium if:
35 (a) The public record:
36 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
37 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
38 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
39 means of an electronic medium would:

1 Sec. 11. NRS 240A.260 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 240A.260 1. If the Secretary of State obtains information that
3 a provision of this chapter or a regulation or order adopted or issued
4 pursuant thereto has been violated by a registrant or another person,
5 the Secretary of State may conduct or cause to be conducted an
6 investigation of the alleged violation.
7 2. If, within a reasonable period of time, a registrant fails to
8 provide the Secretary of State with any information requested by the
9 Secretary of State during an investigation of an alleged violation by
10 the registrant, the Secretary of State may suspend or refuse to renew
11 the registration of the registrant.
12 3. If, after investigation, the Secretary of State determines that
13 a violation has occurred, the Secretary of State may:
14 (a) Serve, by certified mail addressed to the person who has
15 committed the violation, a written order directing the person to
16 cease and desist from the conduct constituting the violation. The
17 order must notify the person that any willful violation of the order
18 may subject the person to prosecution and criminal penalties
19 pursuant to NRS 240A.290 and penalties pursuant to this section
20 and NRS 240A.280.
21 (b) If a registrant has committed the violation:
22 (1) Revoke or suspend the registration of the registrant; or
23 (2) Impose a penalty of not more than $1,000 for each
24 violation. The authority of the Secretary of State to impose a penalty
25 applies regardless of whether the person is still a registrant at the
26 time that the penalty is imposed so long as the person was a
27 registrant at the time that he or she committed the violation. The
28 Secretary of State shall afford any person upon whom such a penalty
29 is imposed an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the provisions of
30 NRS 233B.121.
31 (c) If a person engaged in the business of a document
32 preparation service and was not a registrant at the time of the
33 violation, after a hearing on the matter, impose a penalty for each
34 violation of not more than $5,000 or the amount of economic benefit
35 derived from the violation, whichever is greater.
36 (d) Refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General or a
37 district attorney for commencement of a civil action against the
38 person pursuant to NRS 240A.280.
39 (e) Refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General or a
40 district attorney for prosecution of the person pursuant to
41 NRS 240A.290.
42 (f) Take any combination of the actions described in this
43 subsection.
44 4. Any person who is aware of a violation of this chapter by a
45 document preparation service, a person applying for registration as a
-

– 18 –
1 document preparation service or a person who is engaging in the
2 business of a document preparation service and is not registered by
3 the Secretary of State pursuant to this chapter may file a complaint
4 with the Secretary of State setting forth the details of the violation
5 that are known by the person who is filing the complaint.
6 5. If the Secretary of State receives a complaint alleging a
7 violation of this chapter, the Secretary of State shall notify the
8 document preparation service or other person who is the subject of
9 the complaint. The notice:
10 (a) Must be sent by certified mail;
11 (b) Is deemed to have been received 3 days after the notice is
12 mailed;
13 (c) Must include, without limitation:
14 (1) A description of each allegation contained in the
15 complaint;
16 (2) A statement of each statutory provision which the
17 document preparation service or other person is alleged to have
18 violated;
19 (3) An explanation of any disciplinary action that may be
20 taken against the document preparation service or other person if the
21 Secretary of State determines that the alleged violation occurred;
22 (4) A statement that the document preparation service or
23 other person must respond to the notice not later than 15 days after
24 the notice is received; and
25 (5) Instructions on the manner in which the document
26 preparation service or other person may respond to the notice.
27 6. Any determination by the Secretary of State that a provision
28 of this chapter or a regulation or order adopted or issued pursuant
29 thereto has been violated by a registrant or another person and the
30 imposition of any penalty by the Secretary of State pursuant to this
31 section is a public record.
32 7. Except as otherwise necessary to refer an alleged violation
33 for the commencement of a civil action or prosecution pursuant to
34 paragraph (d) or (e), respectively, of subsection 3, information and
35 documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary of State in
36 connection with an investigation concerning a possible violation
37 of this chapter are not public information and are confidential.
38 Sec. 12. 1. If, pursuant to NRS 240A.123, as amended by
39 section 9 of this act, a business entity files with the Secretary of
40 State a cash bond or surety bond on behalf of an employee of the
41 business entity and the employee is not required to file any other
42 cash bond or surety bond with the Secretary of State pursuant to
43 NRS 240A.120, as amended by section 8 of this act, or 240A.123,
44 as amended by section 9 of this act, the Secretary of State shall:

8 ascribed to it in NRS 240A.015.
9 Sec. 13. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and

13 3. Sections 2, 4, 6 to 10, inclusive, and 12 of this act become
14 effective:
15 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
16 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
17 tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and
