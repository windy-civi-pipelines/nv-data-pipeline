AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State
to adopt a code of professional responsibility for notaries
public; authorizing a notarial officer to refuse to perform
a notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the
procedure for filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering
document preparation services; prohibiting a registrant to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1)
2 prescribing the procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary
3 public; and (2) establishing procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic
4 signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes the
5 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a code of professional
6 responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
7 State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
8 regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries

9 public, including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility
10 adopted pursuant to section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who
11 willfully violates such a code would be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable
12 harm results. (NRS 240.175)
13 Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3
14 of this bill authorizes a notarial officer to refuse to perform a notarial act if the
15 notary officer is not satisfied that: (1) the person executing the document is
16 competent or has capacity to execute the document; or (2) the persons signature is
17 not knowingly and voluntarily made. Section 3 further authorizes a notarial officer
18 to refuse to perform a notarial act under other circumstances where such refusal is
19 not prohibited.
20 Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic
21 notarial acts using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is
22 physically present in the State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill
23 clarifies that an electronic notary public is prohibited from performing an electronic
24 notarial act unless he or she is present in the State. Under existing law, the
25 Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a notary public
26 who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
27 Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
28 preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to
29 indemnify persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS
30 240A.120) However, existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or
31 more employees who perform document preparation services to file such a bond on
32 behalf of all such employees; and (2) exempts the employees of a business entity
33 that files such a bond from the requirement to file their own bonds. (NRS
34 240A.123) Sections 5.3-5.7 of this bill authorize a registrant who performs
35 document preparation services under more than one business entity to file one bond
36 for each such business entity and establish the amount of such a bond on the
37 number of business entities under which the registrant performs document
38 preparation services. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to allow a
39 registrant to perform document preparation services under multiple entities under
40 one bond. Sections 9 and 9.5 of this bill authorize a business entity to file such a
41 bond on behalf of its independent contractors who provide document preparation
42 services.
43 Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or renewal of
44 registration as a document preparation service to provide a list of each entity under
45 which the applicant intends to perform document preparation services during the
46 following calendar year. Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging
47 in the business of a document preparation service for or under any entity for which
48 a bond has not been filed. Under existing law, a registrant who violates that
49 prohibition would be subject to certain administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270)
50 Additionally, a registrant who willfully violates that prohibition is subject to certain
51 criminal penalties. (NRS 240A.290)
52 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be
53 conducted an investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a
54 provision of law, regulation or order relating to document preparation services has
55 been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections 1 and 11 of this bill make information
56 and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary of State in connection with
57 an investigation confidential.

5 711.600, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada
6 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
7 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books
8 and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all
9 times during office hours to inspection by any person, and may be
10 fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be prepared from
11 those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
12 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
13 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other
14 way to the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general
15 public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the
16 federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
17 any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
18 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
19 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
20 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
21 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
22 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
23 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
24 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
25 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
26 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
27 electronically, the confidential information from the information
28 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
29 confidential.
30 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
31 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
32 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
33 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
34 means of an electronic medium if:
35 (a) The public record:
36 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
37 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
38 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

9 within 30 days after its exhaustion.

42 with which a document is to be filed or submitted; or

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public affairs; authorizing the Secretary of State
to adopt a code of professional responsibility for notaries
public; authorizing a notarial officer to refuse to perform
a notarial act under certain circumstances; revising the
procedure for filing cash bonds or surety bonds covering
document preparation services; prohibiting a registrant to
engage in the business of a document preparation service
from engaging in such business for or under an entity that
is not covered by such a bond; providing that certain
information and documents obtained during an
investigation of a document preparation service is
confidential; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations: (1)
2 prescribing the procedure for the appointment and mandatory training of a notary
3 public; and (2) establishing procedures for the notarization of digital and electronic
4 signatures. (NRS 240.017) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes the
5 Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing a code of professional
6 responsibility for notaries public. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
7 State to impose certain sanctions against a notary public who violates any
8 regulation adopted pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing notaries
-

9 public, including, without limitation, any code of professional responsibility
10 adopted pursuant to section 2. In addition, under existing law, a person who
11 willfully violates such a code would be guilty of a category D felony if irreparable
12 harm results. (NRS 240.175)
13 Existing law prohibits certain acts by a notary public. (NRS 240.075) Section 3
14 of this bill authorizes a notarial officer to refuse to perform a notarial act if the
15 notary officer is not satisfied that: (1) the person executing the document is
16 competent or has capacity to execute the document; or (2) the persons signature is
17 not knowingly and voluntarily made. Section 3 further authorizes a notarial officer
18 to refuse to perform a notarial act under other circumstances where such refusal is
19 not prohibited.
20 Existing law authorizes an electronic notary public to perform electronic
21 notarial acts using audio-video communication if the electronic notary public is
22 physically present in the State. (NRS 240.198, 240.1993) Section 5 of this bill
23 clarifies that an electronic notary public is prohibited from performing an electronic
24 notarial act unless he or she is present in the State. Under existing law, the
25 Secretary of State would be authorized to impose sanctions against a notary public
26 who violates the provisions of section 5. (NRS 240.150)
27 Existing law generally requires a person who is registered to provide document
28 preparation services to file with the Secretary of State a cash bond or surety bond to
29 indemnify persons injured by certain acts or omissions by the registrant. (NRS
30 240A.120) However, existing law: (1) authorizes a business entity that has one or
31 more employees who perform document preparation services to file such a bond on
32 behalf of all such employees; and (2) exempts the employees of a business entity
33 that files such a bond from the requirement to file their own bonds. (NRS
34 240A.123) Sections 5.3-5.7 of this bill authorize a registrant who performs
35 document preparation services under more than one business entity to file one bond
36 for each such business entity and establish the amount of such a bond on the
37 number of business entities under which the registrant performs document
38 preparation services. Section 8 of this bill makes a conforming change to allow a
39 registrant to perform document preparation services under multiple entities under
40 one bond. Sections 9 and 9.5 of this bill authorize a business entity to file such a
41 bond on behalf of its independent contractors who provide document preparation
42 services.
43 Sections 6 and 7 of this bill require an applicant for the issuance or renewal of
44 registration as a document preparation service to provide a list of each entity under
45 which the applicant intends to perform document preparation services during the
46 following calendar year. Section 10 of this bill prohibits a registrant from engaging
47 in the business of a document preparation service for or under any entity for which
48 a bond has not been filed. Under existing law, a registrant who violates that
49 prohibition would be subject to certain administrative sanctions. (NRS 240A.270)
50 Additionally, a registrant who willfully violates that prohibition is subject to certain
51 criminal penalties. (NRS 240A.290)
52 Existing law authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct or cause to be
53 conducted an investigation if the Secretary of State obtains information that a
54 provision of law, regulation or order relating to document preparation services has
55 been violated. (NRS 240A.260) Sections 1 and 11 of this bill make information
56 and documents obtained by or filed with the Secretary of State in connection with
57 an investigation confidential.
