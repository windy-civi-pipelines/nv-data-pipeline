Section 1:
FIRST REPRINT A.B. 291
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 291–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS JACKSON,
MOORE, ROTH, GONZÁLEZ; AND DALIA
FEBRUARY 25, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to records of criminal
history. (BDR 14-676)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to records of criminal history; eliminating the
authority for a court to consider a proceeding for which
records have been sealed in determining whether to grant
a petition to seal records relating to a conviction of
another offense; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, if a court orders a record sealed, the proceedings recounted
2 in the record are deemed never to have occurred for most purposes. (NRS 179.285)
3 Although existing law generally deems a proceeding for which records have been
4 sealed never to have occurred, existing law authorizes a court to consider any such
5 proceeding in determining whether to grant a petition to seal records relating to a
6 conviction of another offense. (NRS 179.295) Section 2 of this bill eliminates this
7 authorization and instead prohibits a court from considering any such proceeding in
8 determining whether to grant a petition to seal records relating to a conviction of
9 another offense.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. (Deleted by amendment.)

11 there is sufficient evidence reasonably to conclude that the person
12 will stand trial for the offense.
13 3. The court may, upon the application of a prosecuting
14 attorney or an attorney representing a defendant in a criminal action,
