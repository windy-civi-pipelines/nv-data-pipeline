Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to records of criminal
history. (BDR 14-676)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to records of criminal history; requiring a court to
order certain records of criminal history sealed under
certain circumstances; eliminating the authority for a
court to consider a proceeding for which records have
been sealed in determining whether to grant a petition to
seal records relating to a conviction of another offense;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who was arrested for alleged criminal conduct
2 to file a petition for the sealing of certain records relating to the arrest if: (1) the
3 charges are dismissed; or (2) the person is acquitted of the charges. (NRS 179.255)
4 Section 1 of this bill removes the requirement for such a person to file a petition
5 and instead requires the court in which the charges were dismissed or the acquittal
6 was entered, as applicable, to order the sealing of the records. Section 1 also
7 provides that if a person has been arrested for alleged criminal conduct and the
8 prosecuting attorney having jurisdiction declines prosecution of the charges, the
9 person may petition the court having jurisdiction in which the charges are declined
10 for prosecution: (1) any time after the applicable statute of limitations has run; (2)
11 any time 8 years after the arrest; or (3) pursuant to a stipulation between the parties.
12 Under existing law, if a court orders a record sealed, the proceedings recounted
13 in the record are deemed never to have occurred for most purposes. (NRS 179.285)
14 Although existing law generally deems a proceeding for which records have been
15 sealed never to have occurred, existing law authorizes a court to consider any such
16 proceeding in determining whether to grant a petition to seal records relating to a
17 conviction of another offense. (NRS 179.295) Section 2 of this bill eliminates this
18 authorization and instead prohibits a court from considering any such proceeding in
19 determining whether to grant a petition to seal records relating to a conviction of
20 another offense.
