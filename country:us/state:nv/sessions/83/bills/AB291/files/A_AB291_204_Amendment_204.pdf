EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to records of criminal history; [requiring a court to order certain
records of criminal history sealed under certain circumstances;]
eliminating the authority for a court to consider a proceeding for which
records have been sealed in determining whether to grant a petition to
seal records relating to a conviction of another offense; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes a person who was arrested for alleged criminal conduct to file a
2 petition for the sealing of certain records relating to the arrest if: (1) the charges are dismissed;
3 or (2) the person is acquitted of the charges. (NRS 179.255) Section 1 of this bill removes the
4 requirement for such a person to file a petition and instead requires the court in which the
5 charges were dismissed or the acquittal was entered, as applicable, to order the sealing of the
6 records. Section 1 also provides that if a person has been arrested for alleged criminal conduct
7 and the prosecuting attorney having jurisdiction declines prosecution of the charges, the
8 person may petition the court having jurisdiction in which the charges are declined for
9 prosecution: (1) any time after the applicable statute of limitations has run; (2) any time 8
10 years after the arrest; or (3) pursuant to a stipulation between the parties.]
11 Under existing law, if a court orders a record sealed, the proceedings recounted in the
12 record are deemed never to have occurred for most purposes. (NRS 179.285) Although
13 existing law generally deems a proceeding for which records have been sealed never to have
14 occurred, existing law authorizes a court to consider any such proceeding in determining
15 whether to grant a petition to seal records relating to a conviction of another offense. (NRS
16 179.295) Section 2 of this bill eliminates this authorization and instead prohibits a court from
17 considering any such proceeding in determining whether to grant a petition to seal records
18 relating to a conviction of another offense.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
