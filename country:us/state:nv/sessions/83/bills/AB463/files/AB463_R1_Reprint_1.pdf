EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; prohibiting an
insurer from requiring prior authorization for certain other
medical care; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s
9 Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
10 Section 44 of this bill requires that the procedure for obtaining prior
11 authorization for services reimbursable through Medicaid or the Children’s Health
12 Insurance Program on a fee-for-service basis includes: (1) a list of the specific
13 goods and services for which the Department of Health and Human Services
14 requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by the
15 Department to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Section 44 also requires
16 the Department to publish its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its
17 Internet website and update that website as necessary to account for any changes in
-
*AB463_R1*

– 2 –
18 the procedure. Section 44 prohibits the Department from denying a claim for
19 payment for medical or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior
20 authorization if the Department’s procedures for obtaining prior authorization in
21 effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require prior
22 authorization for that care.
23 Section 45 of this bill requires the Department to approve or deny such a
24 request, or request additional, medically relevant information within 48 hours after
25 receiving the request. Section 46 of this bill requires any adverse determination on
26 a request for prior authorization for services reimbursable through Medicaid or the
27 Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-for-service basis to be made by a
28 physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who is licensed in this
29 State and possesses certain other qualifications. Section 46 requires the
30 Department, in certain circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who
31 requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request with
32 the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the
33 request. Section 46 requires the Department, upon making an adverse
34 determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to
35 the recipient of benefits under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
36 Program to whom the request pertains, including information relating to the right of
37 the recipient to appeal the adverse determination. Section 46 further requires: (1)
38 the Department to establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely
39 resolution of appeals submitted by recipients; and (2) a decision upholding an
40 adverse determination on an appeal submitted by a recipient to be made by a
41 physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or
42 dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization. If the Department
43 approves a request for prior authorization, section 47 of this bill requires the
44 Department to pay the provider of health care the full applicable rate for the
45 relevant care, except in certain circumstances.
46 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that
47 has been approved by a public or private insurer, including Medicaid and the
48 Children’s Health Insurance Program, remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2)
49 treatment related to a chronic condition, until the standard of treatment for that
50 condition changes.
51 Sections 19 and 48 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured to
52 obtain prior authorization for certain medical care, including certain preventive care
53 services. Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
54 authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an
55 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
56 earlier than the end of the business day immediately following the date of
57 admission or the date on which the emergency services are provided. Sections 20
58 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization for
59 certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured within
60 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
61 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency
62 services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain
63 conditions.
64 Section 18 prohibits an insurer other than Medicaid from denying or imposing
65 additional limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously
66 approved if the care at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after
67 the date on which the insurer receives the request and certain other requirements are
68 met. Section 21 of this bill requires such an insurer to exempt providers of health
69 care from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for specific goods and
70 services if the insurer has granted requests for prior authorization for those goods or
71 services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or more during the
72 previous year. Section 21 requires such an insurer to annually conduct reviews of
-
*AB463_R1*

– 3 –
73 each provider of health care in the network of the insurer to determine whether each
74 such provider qualifies for an exemption. If the provider qualifies for an exemption,
75 section 21 requires the insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the
76 applicable goods and services, without requiring the provider to affirmatively
77 request an exemption. Section 22 of this bill prescribes the requirements and
78 procedure for such an insurer to revoke an exemption granted to a provider of
79 health care. Section 22 also requires such an insurer to establish a procedure by
80 which a provider of health care may appeal a revocation of an exemption. Section
81 27 of this bill makes conforming changes to clarify that an insurer may not require
82 prior authorization where prohibited by sections 19-21.
83 Sections 4-15 and 35-42 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
84 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34
85 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 52 of
86 this bill provide that if a private insurer or the Department violates any provision of
87 section 18-20 or 44-49 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization,
88 that the request is deemed approved.
89 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
90 service corporation to comply with sections 2-23. Section 29 of this bill requires
91 the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of sections 33-52 of
92 this bill in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections 30,
93 31 and 56 of this bill require plans of self-insurance for employees of local
94 governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and plans of self-insurance
95 for private employers, respectively, to comply with the requirements of sections 2-
96 27 to the extent applicable. Section 33 provides that a managed care organization
97 that provides services to recipients of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
98 Program is not subject to sections 34-52, but must comply with sections 2-27.
99 Section 55 requires the policies and procedures for coverage for prescription drugs
100 under Medicaid to comply with sections 34-52.

21 care who participate in the network of the health carrier to
22 determine whether those providers meet the criteria prescribed by
23 subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to obtain
24 prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially
25 determined to be ineligible for an exemption based on such a
26 review, the eligibility of the provider of health care to receive an
27 exemption must be independently determined by a provider of
28 health care who:
29 (a) Is licensed in this State;
30 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health

40 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a
41 single 12-month period for each good or service for which the

43 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior
44 authorization pursuant to this section applies to the provision of
45 any good or service covered by the exemption which is provided or
-

– 8 –
1 ordered by the provider of health care to whom the exception
2 applies.
3 5. A health carrier shall not deny a claim or reduce the
4 amount of payment paid under a claim for a good or service that is
5 subject to an exemption pursuant to this section unless:
6 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim
7 knowingly and materially misrepresented the goods or services
8 actually provided to an insured, and the provider of health care
9 made the misrepresentation with the specific intent to obtain a
10 payment from the health carrier to which the provider of health
11 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
12 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not
13 substantially performed or provided, as applicable.
14 Sec. 22. 1. Not more than once during a single 12-month
15 period, a health carrier may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider
16 of health care to receive an exemption from the requirement to
17 obtain prior authorization pursuant to section 21 of this act.
18 2. A health carrier may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an
19 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
20 granted to a provider of health care only if the health carrier
21 determines that the provider of health care would not have met the
22 criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 21 of this act for the
23 good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
24 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider
25 of health care for that good or service during the immediately
26 preceding 3 months; or
27 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10
28 claims for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3
29 months, a retrospective review of at least the last 10 claims
30 submitted by the provider of health care for that good or service.
31 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care
32 meets the criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of
33 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
34 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
35 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2
36 of section 21 of this act before the health carrier may revoke the
37 exemption.
38 4. A health carrier that revokes an exemption from the
39 requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2
40 shall transmit to the provider of health care to which the
41 revocation pertains a notice that includes:
42 (a) The information that the health carrier relied upon when
43 making the determination described in subsection 2;
44 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the
45 revoked exemption applies;
-
*AB463_R1*

– 9 –
1 (c) The date on which the revocation takes effect, which must
2 not be earlier than 30 days after the date on which the health
3 carrier transmits the notice; and
4 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language,
5 of how the provider of health care may appeal the revocation
6 pursuant to subsection 5.
7 5. A health carrier shall adopt a procedure by which a
8 provider of health care may appeal the revocation of an exemption
9 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization. If a provider
10 of health care appeals a revocation of such exemption, the
11 exemption must remain in effect:
12 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next
13 reevaluation pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the
14 provider of health care to continue receiving the exemption.
15 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the
16 5th calendar day after the revocation is upheld or the date
17 contained within the notice sent to the provider of health care
18 pursuant to subsection 4.
19 Sec. 23. If a health carrier violates NRS 687B.225 or
20 sections 17 to 20, inclusive, of this act with respect to a particular
21 request for prior authorization, the request shall be deemed
22 approved.

13 knowledge of health and medicine would believe that the absence
14 of immediate medical attention could result in:
15 (1) Placing the health of the recipient in serious jeopardy;
16 (2) Placing the health of an unborn child of the recipient in
17 serious jeopardy;
18 (3) A serious impairment of a bodily function of the
19 recipient; or

30 construed to require the Department to provide coverage:
31 (a) For medical or dental care that, regardless of whether such

33 the terms and conditions of Medicaid or the Children’s Health
34 Insurance Program, as applicable; or
35 (b) To a person who is not a recipient or is not otherwise
36 eligible to receive coverage under Medicaid or the Children’s
