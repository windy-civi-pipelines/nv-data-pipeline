EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; prohibiting an
insurer from requiring prior authorization for certain other
medical care; requiring an insurer to publish certain
information on the Internet website of the insurer;
requiring an insurer and the Commissioner of Insurance to
compile and submit certain reports; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s
9 Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
10 Specifically, sections 27 and 44 of this bill require that a procedure for
11 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services
12 for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review
13 criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 27
14 and 44 also require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
-

– 2 –
15 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to
16 account for any changes in the procedure. Sections 27 and 44 prohibit an insurer
17 from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the failure
18 to obtain prior authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior
19 authorization in effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require
20 prior authorization for that care.
21 Sections 27 and 45 of this bill revise the period for insurers to take action on a
22 request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer to approve or deny such a
23 request, or request additional, medically relevant information within: (1) 48 hours
24 after receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24
25 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 17 and 46 of this
26 bill require any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be
27 made by a physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who is
28 licensed in this State and possesses certain other qualifications. Sections 17 and 46
29 require an insurer, in certain circumstances, to allow the provider of health care
30 who requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request
31 with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the
32 request. Sections 17 and 46 require an insurer, upon making an adverse
33 determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to
34 the insured to whom the request pertains, including information relating to the right
35 of the insured to appeal the adverse determination. Sections 17 and 46 further
36 require: (1) an insurer to establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely
37 resolution of appeals submitted by insureds; and (2) a decision upholding an
38 adverse determination on an appeal submitted by an insured to be made by a
39 physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or
40 dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
41 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that
42 has been approved by the insurer remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2) treatment
43 related to a chronic condition, until the standard of treatment for that condition
44 changes. Sections 18 and 47 prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured to obtain
45 additional prior authorization for a course of treatment or regimen of medication
46 previously approved by the insurer. Section 18 requires an insurer to honor an
47 approval of a request for prior authorization so long as the approval remains valid,
48 even if the insured obtains coverage under a different policy issued by the insurer.
49 Sections 18 and 47 also prohibit an insurer from denying or imposing additional
50 limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if
51 the care at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after the date on
52 which the insurer receives the request and certain other requirements are met.
53 Sections 18 and 47 require an insurer that approves a request for prior
54 authorization to pay the provider of health care the full applicable rate for the
55 relevant care, except in certain circumstances. Finally, Sections 18 and 47 require
56 an insurer, for the first 90 days of the coverage period for a new insured, to honor a
57 request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the
58 new insured, under certain circumstances.
59 Sections 19, 48 and 55 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured
60 to obtain prior authorization for certain medical care, including certain preventive
61 care services. Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring
62 prior authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an
63 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
64 earlier than the end of the business day immediately following the date of
65 admission or the date on which the emergency services are provided. Sections 20
66 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization for
67 certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured within
68 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
69 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency
-

70 services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain
71 conditions.
72 Sections 24 and 55 of this bill require insurers to receive and respond to
73 requests for prior authorization for prescription drugs through a secure transmission
74 that complies with a standard established by the National Council for Prescription
75 Drug Programs for the electronic transmission of pharmaceutical records.
76 Sections 21 and 50 of this bill require insurers to exempt providers of health
77 care from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for specific goods and
78 services if the insurer has granted requests for prior authorization for those goods or
79 services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or more during the
80 previous year. Sections 21 and 50 require insurers to annually conduct reviews of
81 each provider of health care in the network of the insurer or who has submitted a
82 request for prior authorization to Medicaid in the immediately preceding 12
83 months, as applicable, to determine whether each such provider qualifies for an
84 exemption. If the provider qualifies for an exemption, sections 21 and 50 require
85 the insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods and
86 services, without requiring the provider to affirmatively request an exemption.
87 Sections 22 and 51 of this bill prescribe the requirements and procedure for an
88 insurer to revoke an exemption granted to a provider of health care. Sections 22
89 and 51 also require an insurer to establish a procedure by which a provider of
90 health care may appeal a revocation of an exemption.
91 Sections 3-16 and 35-43 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
92 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34
93 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 52 of
94 this bill provide that if an insurer violates any provision of section 17-20, 27 or 44-
95 49 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the request is
96 deemed approved. Sections 23 and 52 also clarify that nothing in any provision of
97 section 17-22, 27 or 44-51 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that
98 the insurer does not cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to
99 persons to whom the insured is not obligated to provide coverage.
100 Sections 25 and 53 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its
101 Internet website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that
102 have been processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
103 Sections 26 and 54 of this bill additionally require an insurer to publish an annual
104 report of certain information relating to requests for prior authorization processed
105 by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
106 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
107 service corporation to comply with sections 2-26. Section 29 of this bill requires
108 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
109 provisions of sections 33-54 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
110 governing Medicaid. Sections 30, 31 and 56 of this bill require plans of self-
111 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
112 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
113 with the requirements of sections 2-26 to the extent applicable. Section 33 provides
114 that a managed care organization that provides services to recipients of Medicaid or
115 the Children’s Health Insurance Program is not subject to sections 34-54, but must
116 comply with sections 2-26. Section 55 requires the policies and procedures for
117 coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 34-54.

40 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
41 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
42 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2

24 authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
25 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the
26 eligibility of the provider of health care to receive an exemption
27 must be independently determined by a provider of health care
28 who:
29 (a) Is licensed in this State;
30 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health
31 care who is being evaluated for an exemption; and
32 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the
33 exemption has been initially denied.
34 3. A provider of health care who is not granted an exemption
35 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular
36 good or service may, for that specific good or service, request from
37 the Department any evidence that supported the decision of the
38 Department to not grant the exemption for that good or service. A
39 provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
40 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a
41 single 12-month period for each good or service for which the
42 provider of health care has not been granted an exemption.
43 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior
44 authorization pursuant to this section applies to the provision of
45 any good or service covered by the exemption which is provided or
-

– 33 –
1 ordered by the provider of health care to whom the exception
2 applies.
3 5. The Department shall not deny a claim or reduce the
4 amount of payment paid under a claim for a good or service that is
5 subject to an exemption pursuant to this section unless:
6 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim
7 knowingly and materially misrepresented the goods or services
8 actually provided to a recipient, and the provider of health care
9 made the misrepresentation with the specific intent to obtain a
10 payment from the Department to which the provider of health care
11 is not legally or contractually entitled; or
12 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not
13 substantially performed or provided, as applicable.
14 Sec. 51. 1. Not more than once during a single 12-month
15 period, the Department may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider
16 of health care to receive an exemption from the requirement to
17 obtain prior authorization pursuant to section 50 of this act.
18 2. The Department may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an
19 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
20 granted to a provider of health care only if the Department
21 determines that the provider of health care would not have met the
22 criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 50 of this act for the
23 good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
24 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider
25 of health care for that good or service during the immediately
26 preceding 3 months; or
27 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10
28 claims for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3
29 months, a retrospective review of at least the last 10 claims
30 submitted by the provider of health care for that good or service.
31 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care
32 meets the criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of
33 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
34 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
35 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2
36 of section 50 of this act before the Department may revoke the
37 exemption.
38 4. If the Department revokes an exemption from the
39 requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection
40 2, the Department shall transmit to the provider of health care to
41 which the revocation pertains a notice to that includes:
42 (a) The information that the Department relied upon when
43 making the determination described in subsection 2;
44 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the
45 revoked exemption applies;
-
*AB463*
– 34 –
1 (c) The date on which the revocation takes effect, which must
2 not be earlier than 30 days after the date on which the Department
3 transmits the notice; and
4 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language,
5 of how the provider of health care may appeal the revocation
6 pursuant to subsection 5.
7 5. The Department shall adopt a procedure by which a
8 provider of health care may appeal the revocation of an exemption
9 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization. If a provider
10 of health care appeals a revocation of such exemption, the
11 exemption must remain in effect:
12 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next
13 reevaluation pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the
14 provider of health care to continue receiving the exemption.
15 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the
16 5th calendar day after the revocation is upheld or the date
17 contained within the notice sent to the provider of health care
18 pursuant to subsection 4.
19 Sec. 52. 1. If the Department violates sections 44 to 51,
20 inclusive, of this act with respect to a particular request for prior
21 authorization, the request shall be deemed approved.
22 2. Nothing in sections 44 to 51, inclusive, of this act shall be
23 construed to require the Department to provide coverage:
24 (a) For medical or dental care that, regardless of whether such
25 care is medically necessary, would not be a covered benefit under
26 the terms and conditions of Medicaid or the Children’s Health
27 Insurance Program, as applicable; or
28 (b) To a person who is not a recipient or is not otherwise
29 eligible to receive coverage under Medicaid or the Children’s
30 Health Insurance Program, as applicable, on the date on which
31 medical or dental care is provided to the person.
32 Sec. 53. 1. On or before March 1 of each calendar year, the
33 Department shall publish on an Internet website maintained by

A.B. 463
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 463–ASSEMBLYMEMBER BACKUS
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to prior authorization.
(BDR 57-825)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 30)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing
prior authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting
an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered
emergency services or denying coverage for covered,
medically necessary emergency services; prohibiting an
insurer from requiring prior authorization for certain other
medical care; requiring an insurer to publish certain
information on the Internet website of the insurer;
requiring an insurer and the Commissioner of Insurance to
compile and submit certain reports; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s
9 Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
10 Specifically, sections 27 and 44 of this bill require that a procedure for
11 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services
12 for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review
13 criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 27
14 and 44 also require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
-
*AB463*

– 2 –
15 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to
16 account for any changes in the procedure. Sections 27 and 44 prohibit an insurer
17 from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the failure
18 to obtain prior authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior
19 authorization in effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require
20 prior authorization for that care.
21 Sections 27 and 45 of this bill revise the period for insurers to take action on a
22 request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer to approve or deny such a
23 request, or request additional, medically relevant information within: (1) 48 hours
24 after receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24
25 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 17 and 46 of this
26 bill require any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be
27 made by a physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who is
28 licensed in this State and possesses certain other qualifications. Sections 17 and 46
29 require an insurer, in certain circumstances, to allow the provider of health care
30 who requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request
31 with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the
32 request. Sections 17 and 46 require an insurer, upon making an adverse
33 determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to
34 the insured to whom the request pertains, including information relating to the right
35 of the insured to appeal the adverse determination. Sections 17 and 46 further
36 require: (1) an insurer to establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely
37 resolution of appeals submitted by insureds; and (2) a decision upholding an
38 adverse determination on an appeal submitted by an insured to be made by a
39 physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or
40 dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
41 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that
42 has been approved by the insurer remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2) treatment
43 related to a chronic condition, until the standard of treatment for that condition
44 changes. Sections 18 and 47 prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured to obtain
45 additional prior authorization for a course of treatment or regimen of medication
46 previously approved by the insurer. Section 18 requires an insurer to honor an
47 approval of a request for prior authorization so long as the approval remains valid,
48 even if the insured obtains coverage under a different policy issued by the insurer.
49 Sections 18 and 47 also prohibit an insurer from denying or imposing additional
50 limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if
51 the care at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after the date on
52 which the insurer receives the request and certain other requirements are met.
53 Sections 18 and 47 require an insurer that approves a request for prior
54 authorization to pay the provider of health care the full applicable rate for the
55 relevant care, except in certain circumstances. Finally, Sections 18 and 47 require
56 an insurer, for the first 90 days of the coverage period for a new insured, to honor a
57 request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the
58 new insured, under certain circumstances.
59 Sections 19, 48 and 55 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured
60 to obtain prior authorization for certain medical care, including certain preventive
61 care services. Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring
62 prior authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an
63 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
64 earlier than the end of the business day immediately following the date of
65 admission or the date on which the emergency services are provided. Sections 20
66 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization for
67 certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured within
68 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
69 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency
-

– 3 –
70 services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain
71 conditions.
72 Sections 24 and 55 of this bill require insurers to receive and respond to
73 requests for prior authorization for prescription drugs through a secure transmission
74 that complies with a standard established by the National Council for Prescription
75 Drug Programs for the electronic transmission of pharmaceutical records.
76 Sections 21 and 50 of this bill require insurers to exempt providers of health
77 care from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for specific goods and
78 services if the insurer has granted requests for prior authorization for those goods or
79 services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or more during the
80 previous year. Sections 21 and 50 require insurers to annually conduct reviews of
81 each provider of health care in the network of the insurer or who has submitted a
82 request for prior authorization to Medicaid in the immediately preceding 12
83 months, as applicable, to determine whether each such provider qualifies for an
84 exemption. If the provider qualifies for an exemption, sections 21 and 50 require
85 the insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods and
86 services, without requiring the provider to affirmatively request an exemption.
87 Sections 22 and 51 of this bill prescribe the requirements and procedure for an
88 insurer to revoke an exemption granted to a provider of health care. Sections 22
89 and 51 also require an insurer to establish a procedure by which a provider of
90 health care may appeal a revocation of an exemption.
91 Sections 3-16 and 35-43 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
92 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34
93 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 52 of
94 this bill provide that if an insurer violates any provision of section 17-20, 27 or 44-
95 49 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the request is
96 deemed approved. Sections 23 and 52 also clarify that nothing in any provision of
97 section 17-22, 27 or 44-51 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that
98 the insurer does not cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to
99 persons to whom the insured is not obligated to provide coverage.
100 Sections 25 and 53 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its
101 Internet website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that
102 have been processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
103 Sections 26 and 54 of this bill additionally require an insurer to publish an annual
104 report of certain information relating to requests for prior authorization processed
105 by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
106 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
107 service corporation to comply with sections 2-26. Section 29 of this bill requires
108 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
109 provisions of sections 33-54 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
110 governing Medicaid. Sections 30, 31 and 56 of this bill require plans of self-
111 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
112 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
113 with the requirements of sections 2-26 to the extent applicable. Section 33 provides
114 that a managed care organization that provides services to recipients of Medicaid or
115 the Children’s Health Insurance Program is not subject to sections 34-54, but must
116 comply with sections 2-26. Section 55 requires the policies and procedures for
117 coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 34-54.

20 substantially performed or provided, as applicable.

24 obtain prior authorization pursuant to section 21 of this act.
25 2. A health carrier may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an

40 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
41 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
42 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2

39 provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
40 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a
41 single 12-month period for each good or service for which the
42 provider of health care has not been granted an exemption.

10 payment from the Department to which the provider of health care
11 is not legally or contractually entitled; or

24 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider
25 of health care for that good or service during the immediately
26 preceding 3 months; or

31 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care
32 meets the criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of
33 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
34 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
35 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2
36 of section 50 of this act before the Department may revoke the
37 exemption.

12 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next
13 reevaluation pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the
14 provider of health care to continue receiving the exemption.

20 inclusive, of this act with respect to a particular request for prior
21 authorization, the request shall be deemed approved.
