EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing prior
authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting an insurer from
requiring prior authorization for covered emergency services or
denying coverage for covered, medically necessary emergency
services; prohibiting an insurer from requiring prior authorization for
certain other medical care; [requiring an insurer to publish certain
information on the Internet website of the insurer; requiring an insurer
and the Commissioner of Insurance to compile and submit certain
reports;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
2 insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain circumstances. If an
3 insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure
4 for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
5 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
6 687B.225) This bill establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior
7 authorization for medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the
8 Children’s Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
9 [Specifically, sections 27 and] Section 44 of this bill [require] requires that [a] the
10 procedure for obtaining prior authorization for services reimbursable through Medicaid or
11 the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-for-service basis includes: (1) a list of
12 the specific goods and services for which the [insurer] Department of Health and Human
13 Services requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by the [insurer]
14 Department to evaluate requests for prior authorization. [Sections 27 and] Section 44 also
15 [require an insurer] requires the Department to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
16 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to account for any
17 changes in the procedure. [Sections 27 and] Section 44 [prohibit an insurer] prohibits the
18 Department from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the
19 failure to obtain prior authorization if the [insurer’s] Department’s procedures for obtaining
20 prior authorization in effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require prior
21 authorization for that care.
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 4
22 [Sections 27 and] Section 45 of this bill [revise the period for insurers to take action on a
23 request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer] requires the Department to approve
24 or deny such a request, or request additional, medically relevant information within [: (1)] 48
25 hours after receiving the request . [, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24
26 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 17 and] Section 46 of this
27 bill [require] requires any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization for
28 services reimbursable through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program on
29 a fee-for-service basis to be made by a physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a
30 dentist, who is licensed in this State and possesses certain other qualifications. [Sections 17
31 and] Section 46 [require an insurer,] requires the Department, in certain circumstances, to
32 allow the provider of health care who requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues
33 involved in the request with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a
34 determination on the request. [Sections 17 and] Section 46 [require an insurer,] requires the
35 Department, upon making an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, to
36 transmit certain information to the [insured] recipient of benefits under Medicaid or the
37 Children’s Health Insurance Program to whom the request pertains, including information
38 relating to the right of the [insured] recipient to appeal the adverse determination. [Sections
39 17 and] Section 46 further [require:] requires: (1) [an insurer] the Department to establish a
40 process for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by [insureds;]
41 recipients; and (2) a decision upholding an adverse determination on an appeal submitted by
42 an [insured] recipient to be made by a physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond
43 those required of a physician or dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
44 If the Department approves a request for prior authorization, section 47 of this bill
45 requires the Department to pay the provider of health care the full applicable rate for
46 the relevant care, except in certain circumstances.
47 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that has been
48 approved by [the] a public or private insurer , including Medicaid and the Children’s
49 Health Insurance Program, remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2) treatment related to a
50 chronic condition, until the standard of treatment for that condition changes. [Sections 18 and
51 47 prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured to obtain additional prior authorization for a
52 course of treatment or regimen of medication previously approved by the insurer. Section 18
53 requires an insurer to honor an approval of a request for prior authorization so long as the
54 approval remains valid, even if the insured obtains coverage under a different policy issued by
55 the insurer. Sections 18 and 47 also prohibit an insurer from denying or imposing additional
56 limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if the care
57 at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after the date on which the insurer
58 receives the request and certain other requirements are met. Sections 18 and 47 require an
59 insurer that approves a request for prior authorization to pay the provider of health care the
60 full applicable rate for the relevant care, except in certain circumstances. Finally, Sections 18
61 and 47 require an insurer, for the first 90 days of the coverage period for a new insured, to
62 honor a request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the
63 new insured, under certain circumstances.]
64 Sections 19 [,] and 48 [and 55] of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured
65 to obtain prior authorization for certain medical care, including certain preventive care
66 services. Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior authorization
67 for covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an insurer from requiring that an
68 insured or provider of health care notify the insurer earlier than the end of the business day
69 immediately following the date of admission or the date on which the emergency services are
70 provided. Sections 20 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior
71 authorization for certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured
72 within 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
73 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2)
74 establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain conditions.
75 [Sections 24 and 55 of this bill require insurers to receive and respond to requests for
76 prior authorization for prescription drugs through a secure transmission that complies with a
77 standard established by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs for the electronic
78 transmission of pharmaceutical records.
79 Sections] Section 18 prohibits an insurer other than Medicaid from denying or
80 imposing additional limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 5
81 previously approved if the care at issue in the request is provided within 45 business
82 days after the date on which the insurer receives the request and certain other
83 requirements are met. Section 21 [and 50] of this bill [require insurers] requires such an
84 insurer to exempt providers of health care from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
85 for specific goods and services if the insurer has granted requests for prior authorization for
86 those goods or services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or more during the
87 previous year. [Sections] Section 21 [and 50 require insurers] requires such an insurer to
88 annually conduct reviews of each provider of health care in the network of the insurer [or who
89 has submitted a request for prior authorization to Medicaid in the immediately preceding 12
90 months, as applicable,] to determine whether each such provider qualifies for an exemption. If
91 the provider qualifies for an exemption, [sections] section 21 [and 50 require] requires the
92 insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods and services, without
93 requiring the provider to affirmatively request an exemption. [Sections] Section 22 [and 51]
94 of this bill [prescribe] prescribes the requirements and procedure for [an] such an insurer to
95 revoke an exemption granted to a provider of health care. [Sections] Section 22 [and 51] also
96 [require an] requires such an insurer to establish a procedure by which a provider of health
97 care may appeal a revocation of an exemption. Section 27 of this bill makes conforming
98 changes to clarify that an insurer may not require prior authorization where prohibited
99 by sections 19-21.
100 Sections [3-16] 4-15 and [35-43] 35-42 of this bill define certain terms relating to the
101 process of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34 of
102 this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 52 of this bill provide
103 that if [an] a private insurer or the Department violates any provision of section [17-20, 27]
104 18-20 or 44-49 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the request is
105 deemed approved. [Sections 23 and 52 also clarify that nothing in any provision of section 17-
106 22, 27 or 44-51 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that the insurer does not
107 cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to persons to whom the insured is
108 not obligated to provide coverage.
109 Sections 25 and 53 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its Internet
110 website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that have been
111 processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year. Sections 26 and 54 of this bill
112 additionally require an insurer to publish an annual report of certain information relating to
113 requests for prior authorization processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding
114 year.]
115 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
116 corporation to comply with sections [2-26.] 2-23. Section 29 of this bill requires the Director
117 of the Department [of Health and Human Services] to administer the provisions of sections
118 [33-54] 33-52 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
119 Sections 30, 31 and 56 of this bill require plans of self-insurance for employees of local
120 governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and plans of self-insurance for private
121 employers, respectively, to comply with the requirements of sections [2-26] 2-27 to the extent
122 applicable. Section 33 provides that a managed care organization that provides services to
123 recipients of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program is not subject to sections
124 [34-54,] 34-52, but must comply with sections [2-26.] 2-27. Section 55 requires the policies
125 and procedures for coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections
126 [34-54.] 34-52.

26 2. If a health carrier requires an insured or his or her provider of health
27 care to notify the health carrier that the insured has been admitted to a hospital
28 to receive emergency medical services or has received emergency medical
29 services, the health carrier shall not require an insured or a provider of health
30 care to transmit such a notice earlier than the end of the business day
31 immediately following the date on which the insured was admitted or the
32 emergency medical services were provided, as applicable.
33 3. A health carrier shall not deny coverage for emergency medical services
34 covered by the health carrier that are medically necessary. Emergency medical
35 services are presumed to be medically necessary if, within 72 hours after an
36 insured is admitted to receive emergency medical services, the provider of health
37 care of the insured transmits to the health carrier a certification, in writing, that
38 the condition of the insured required emergency medical services. The health
39 carrier may rebut that presumption by establishing, by clear and convincing
40 evidence, that the emergency medical services were not medically necessary.
41 4. If an insured receives emergency medical services and must additionally
42 receive post-evaluation or post-stabilization medical care, and a health carrier
43 requires prior authorization for the post-evaluation or post-stabilization care, the
44 health carrier shall approve or deny a request for prior authorization for such
45 care within 60 minutes after receiving the request.
46 5. A health carrier shall make all determinations for whether emergency
47 medical services are medically necessary without regard to whether a provider of
48 health care that provided or billed for those services participates in the network of
49 the health carrier.
50 6. As used in this section:
51 (a) “Emergency medical services” means health care services that are
52 provided in a medical facility by a provider of health care to screen and to
53 stabilize an insured after the sudden onset of a medical condition that manifests
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 11
1 itself by symptoms of such sufficient severity that a prudent layperson who
2 possesses average knowledge of health and medicine would believe that the
3 absence of immediate medical attention could result in:
4 (1) Placing the health of the insured in serious jeopardy;
5 (2) Placing the health of an unborn child of the insured in serious
6 jeopardy;
7 (3) A serious impairment of a bodily function of the insured; or
8 (4) A serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of the insured.
9 (b) “Medical facility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 449.0151.
10 Sec. 21. 1. A health carrier shall exempt a provider of health care who
11 participates in the network of the health carrier from the requirement to obtain
12 prior authorization for a specific good or service if, within the immediately
13 preceding 12 months, the health carrier approved 80 percent or more of the
14 requests for prior authorization for that specific good or service submitted by the
15 provider of health care. If a provider of health care qualifies for an exemption
16 pursuant to this section, a health carrier shall:
17 (a) Automatically grant the exemption without requiring the provider of
18 health care to submit a request for the exemption; and
19 (b) Transmit to the provider of health care after granting the exemption a
20 notice that includes:
21 (1) A statement that the provider of health care has been granted an
22 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization from the health
23 carrier for the specific goods and services listed pursuant to subparagraph (2);
24 (2) A list of goods and services to which the exemption applies; and
25 (3) The date on which the exemption expires, which must not be earlier
26 than 12 months after the date on which the health carrier granted the exemption.
27 2. A health carrier shall provide for an annual review of the requests for
28 prior authorization submitted by providers of health care who participate in the
29 network of the health carrier to determine whether those providers meet the
30 criteria prescribed by subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to
31 obtain prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
32 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the eligibility of the
33 provider of health care to receive an exemption must be independently
34 determined by a provider of health care who:
35 (a) Is licensed in this State;
36 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health care who is
37 being evaluated for an exemption; and
38 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the exemption
39 has been initially denied.
40 3. A provider of health care who is not granted an exemption from the
41 requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular good or service may,
42 for that specific good or service, request from the health carrier any evidence that
43 supported the decision of the health carrier to not grant the exemption for that
44 good or service. A provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
45 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a single 12-
46 month period for each good or service for which the provider of health care has
47 not been granted an exemption.
48 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
49 pursuant to this section applies to the provision of any good or service covered by
50 the exemption which is provided or ordered by the provider of health care to
51 whom the exception applies.
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 12
1 5. A health carrier shall not deny a claim or reduce the amount of payment
2 paid under a claim for a good or service that is subject to an exemption pursuant
3 to this section unless:
4 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim knowingly and
5 materially misrepresented the goods or services actually provided to an insured,
6 and the provider of health care made the misrepresentation with the specific
7 intent to obtain a payment from the health carrier to which the provider of health
8 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
9 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not substantially
10 performed or provided, as applicable.
11 Sec. 22. 1. Not more than once during a single 12-month period, a health
12 carrier may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider of health care to receive an
13 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to section
14 21 of this act.
15 2. A health carrier may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an exemption
16 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization granted to a provider of health
17 care only if the health carrier determines that the provider of health care would
18 not have met the criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 21 of this act for
19 the good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
20 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider of health care
21 for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months; or
22 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10 claims for that
23 good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months, a retrospective
24 review of at least the last 10 claims submitted by the provider of health care for
25 that good or service.
26 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care meets the
27 criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of an exemption based on a
28 review conducted pursuant to that subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria
29 must be independently determined by a provider of health care described in
30 subsection 2 of section 21 of this act before the health carrier may revoke the
31 exemption.
32 4. A health carrier that revokes an exemption from the requirement to
33 obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2 shall transmit to the provider
34 of health care to which the revocation pertains a notice that includes:
35 (a) The information that the health carrier relied upon when making the
36 determination described in subsection 2;
37 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the revoked exemption
38 applies;
39 (c) The date on which the revocation takes effect, which must not be earlier
40 than 30 days after the date on which the health carrier transmits the notice; and
41 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language, of how the
42 provider of health care may appeal the revocation pursuant to subsection 5.
43 5. A health carrier shall adopt a procedure by which a provider of health
44 care may appeal the revocation of an exemption from the requirement to obtain
45 prior authorization. If a provider of health care appeals a revocation of such
46 exemption, the exemption must remain in effect:
47 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next reevaluation
48 pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the provider of health care to
49 continue receiving the exemption.
50 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the 5th calendar
51 day after the revocation is upheld or the date contained within the notice sent to
52 the provider of health care pursuant to subsection 4.

3 authorization, the request shall be deemed approved.
4 [2. Nothing in NRS 687B.225 or sections 17 to 22, inclusive, of this act
5 shall be construed to require a health carrier to provide coverage:

7 medically necessary, would not be a covered benefit under the terms and
8 conditions of the contract or policy of insurance;
9 (b) To a person who is not insured by the health carrier on the date on which
10 medical or dental care is provided to the person; or

50 prior authorization for the post-evaluation or post-stabilization care, the
51 Department shall approve or deny a request for prior authorization for such care
52 within 60 minutes after receiving the request.
53 5. As used in this section:
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 26
1 (a) “Emergency services” means health care services that are provided in a
2 medical facility by a provider of health care to screen and to stabilize a recipient
3 after the sudden onset of a medical condition that manifests itself by symptoms of
4 such sufficient severity that a prudent layperson who possesses average
5 knowledge of health and medicine would believe that the absence of immediate
6 medical attention could result in:
7 (1) Placing the health of the recipient in serious jeopardy;
8 (2) Placing the health of an unborn child of the recipient in serious
9 jeopardy;
10 (3) A serious impairment of a bodily function of the recipient; or
11 (4) A serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part of the recipient.
12 (b) “Medical facility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 449.0151.
13 Sec. 50. [1. The Department shall exempt a provider of health care from
14 the requirement to obtain prior authorization for a specific good or service if,
15 within the immediately preceding 12 months, the Department approved 80
16 percent or more of the requests for prior authorization for that specific good or
17 service submitted by the provider of health care. If a provider of health care
18 qualifies for an exemption pursuant to this section, the Department shall:
19 (a) Automatically grant the exemption without requiring the provider of
20 health care to submit a request for the exemption; and
21 (b) Transmit to the provider of health care after granting the exemption a
22 notice that includes:
23 (1) A statement that the provider of health care has been granted an
24 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization from the
25 Department for the specific goods and services listed pursuant to subparagraph
26 (2);
27 (2) A list of goods and services to which the exemption applies; and
28 (3) The date on which the exemption expires, which must not be earlier
29 than 12 months after the date on which the Department granted the exemption.
30 2. The Department shall provide for an annual review of all of the requests
31 for prior authorization submitted by providers of health care during the
32 immediately preceding year to determine whether those providers meet the
33 criteria prescribed by subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to
34 obtain prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
35 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the eligibility of the
36 provider of health care to receive an exemption must be independently
37 determined by a provider of health care who:
38 (a) Is licensed in this State;
39 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health care who is
40 being evaluated for an exemption; and
41 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the exemption
42 has been initially denied.
43 3. A provider of health care who is not granted an exemption from the
44 requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular good or service may,
45 for that specific good or service, request from the Department any evidence that
46 supported the decision of the Department to not grant the exemption for that
47 good or service. A provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
48 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a single 12-
49 month period for each good or service for which the provider of health care has
50 not been granted an exemption.
51 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
52 pursuant to this section applies to the provision of any good or service covered by
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 27
1 the exemption which is provided or ordered by the provider of health care to
2 whom the exception applies.
3 5. The Department shall not deny a claim or reduce the amount of payment
4 paid under a claim for a good or service that is subject to an exemption pursuant
5 to this section unless:
6 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim knowingly and
7 materially misrepresented the goods or services actually provided to a recipient,
8 and the provider of health care made the misrepresentation with the specific
9 intent to obtain a payment from the Department to which the provider of health
10 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
11 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not substantially
12 performed or provided, as applicable.] (Deleted by amendment.)
13 Sec. 51. [1. Not more than once during a single 12-month period, the
14 Department may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider of health care to receive
15 an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to
16 section 50 of this act.
17 2. The Department may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an exemption
18 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization granted to a provider of health
19 care only if the Department determines that the provider of health care would not
20 have met the criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 50 of this act for the
21 good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
22 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider of health care
23 for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months; or
24 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10 claims for that
25 good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months, a retrospective
26 review of at least the last 10 claims submitted by the provider of health care for
27 that good or service.
28 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care meets the
29 criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of an exemption based on a
30 review conducted pursuant to that subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria
31 must be independently determined by a provider of health care described in
32 subsection 2 of section 50 of this act before the Department may revoke the
33 exemption.
34 4. If the Department revokes an exemption from the requirement to obtain
35 prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2, the Department shall transmit to the
36 provider of health care to which the revocation pertains a notice to that includes:
37 (a) The information that the Department relied upon when making the
38 determination described in subsection 2;
39 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the revoked exemption
40 applies;
41 (c) The date on which the revocation takes effect, which must not be earlier
42 than 30 days after the date on which the Department transmits the notice; and
43 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language, of how the
44 provider of health care may appeal the revocation pursuant to subsection 5.
45 5. The Department shall adopt a procedure by which a provider of health
46 care may appeal the revocation of an exemption from the requirement to obtain
47 prior authorization. If a provider of health care appeals a revocation of such
48 exemption, the exemption must remain in effect:
49 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next reevaluation
50 pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the provider of health care to
51 continue receiving the exemption.
Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 28
1 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the 5th calendar
2 day after the revocation is upheld or the date contained within the notice sent to
3 the provider of health care pursuant to subsection 4.] (Deleted by amendment.)
4 Sec. 52. 1. If the Department violates sections 44 to 51, inclusive, of this
5 act with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, the request shall
6 be deemed approved.
7 2. Nothing in sections 44 to 51, inclusive, of this act shall be construed to
8 require the Department to provide coverage:
9 (a) For medical or dental care that, regardless of whether such care is
10 medically necessary, would not be a covered benefit under the terms and
11 conditions of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as
12 applicable; or
13 (b) To a person who is not a recipient or is not otherwise eligible to receive
14 coverage under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, as
15 applicable, on the date on which medical or dental care is provided to the person.
16 Sec. 53. [1. On or before March 1 of each calendar year, the Department
17 shall publish on an Internet website maintained by the Department in an easily
18 accessible format the following information for the immediately preceding
19 calendar year, in aggregated form for all requests for prior authorization received
20 by the Department during the immediately preceding year and disaggregated in

37 prior authorization; and
38 (b) The types of medical or dental care at issue in the request for prior
39 authorization, including the specific types of prescription drugs, procedures or

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements governing prior
authorization for medical or dental care; prohibiting an insurer from
requiring prior authorization for covered emergency services or
denying coverage for covered, medically necessary emergency
services; prohibiting an insurer from requiring prior authorization for
certain other medical care; [requiring an insurer to publish certain
information on the Internet website of the insurer; requiring an insurer
and the Commissioner of Insurance to compile and submit certain
reports;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
2 insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain circumstances. If an
3 insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure
4 for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
5 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
6 687B.225) This bill establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior
7 authorization for medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the
8 Children’s Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
9 [Specifically, sections 27 and] Section 44 of this bill [require] requires that [a] the
10 procedure for obtaining prior authorization for services reimbursable through Medicaid or
11 the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-for-service basis includes: (1) a list of
12 the specific goods and services for which the [insurer] Department of Health and Human
13 Services requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by the [insurer]
14 Department to evaluate requests for prior authorization. [Sections 27 and] Section 44 also
15 [require an insurer] requires the Department to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
16 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to account for any
17 changes in the procedure. [Sections 27 and] Section 44 [prohibit an insurer] prohibits the
18 Department from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the
19 failure to obtain prior authorization if the [insurer’s] Department’s procedures for obtaining
20 prior authorization in effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require prior
21 authorization for that care.

Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 4
22 [Sections 27 and] Section 45 of this bill [revise the period for insurers to take action on a
23 request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer] requires the Department to approve
24 or deny such a request, or request additional, medically relevant information within [: (1)] 48
25 hours after receiving the request . [, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24
26 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 17 and] Section 46 of this
27 bill [require] requires any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization for
28 services reimbursable through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program on
29 a fee-for-service basis to be made by a physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a
30 dentist, who is licensed in this State and possesses certain other qualifications. [Sections 17
31 and] Section 46 [require an insurer,] requires the Department, in certain circumstances, to
32 allow the provider of health care who requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues
33 involved in the request with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a
34 determination on the request. [Sections 17 and] Section 46 [require an insurer,] requires the
35 Department, upon making an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, to
36 transmit certain information to the [insured] recipient of benefits under Medicaid or the
37 Children’s Health Insurance Program to whom the request pertains, including information
38 relating to the right of the [insured] recipient to appeal the adverse determination. [Sections
39 17 and] Section 46 further [require:] requires: (1) [an insurer] the Department to establish a
40 process for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by [insureds;]
41 recipients; and (2) a decision upholding an adverse determination on an appeal submitted by
42 an [insured] recipient to be made by a physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond
43 those required of a physician or dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization.
44 If the Department approves a request for prior authorization, section 47 of this bill
45 requires the Department to pay the provider of health care the full applicable rate for
46 the relevant care, except in certain circumstances.
47 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that has been
48 approved by [the] a public or private insurer , including Medicaid and the Children’s
49 Health Insurance Program, remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2) treatment related to a
50 chronic condition, until the standard of treatment for that condition changes. [Sections 18 and
51 47 prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured to obtain additional prior authorization for a
52 course of treatment or regimen of medication previously approved by the insurer. Section 18
53 requires an insurer to honor an approval of a request for prior authorization so long as the
54 approval remains valid, even if the insured obtains coverage under a different policy issued by
55 the insurer. Sections 18 and 47 also prohibit an insurer from denying or imposing additional
56 limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if the care
57 at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after the date on which the insurer
58 receives the request and certain other requirements are met. Sections 18 and 47 require an
59 insurer that approves a request for prior authorization to pay the provider of health care the
60 full applicable rate for the relevant care, except in certain circumstances. Finally, Sections 18
61 and 47 require an insurer, for the first 90 days of the coverage period for a new insured, to
62 honor a request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the
63 new insured, under certain circumstances.]
64 Sections 19 [,] and 48 [and 55] of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured
65 to obtain prior authorization for certain medical care, including certain preventive care
66 services. Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior authorization
67 for covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an insurer from requiring that an
68 insured or provider of health care notify the insurer earlier than the end of the business day
69 immediately following the date of admission or the date on which the emergency services are
70 provided. Sections 20 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior
71 authorization for certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured
72 within 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
73 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2)
74 establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain conditions.
75 [Sections 24 and 55 of this bill require insurers to receive and respond to requests for
76 prior authorization for prescription drugs through a secure transmission that complies with a
77 standard established by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs for the electronic
78 transmission of pharmaceutical records.
79 Sections] Section 18 prohibits an insurer other than Medicaid from denying or
80 imposing additional limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has

Assembly Amendment No. 480 to Assembly Bill No. 463 Page 5
81 previously approved if the care at issue in the request is provided within 45 business
82 days after the date on which the insurer receives the request and certain other
83 requirements are met. Section 21 [and 50] of this bill [require insurers] requires such an
84 insurer to exempt providers of health care from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
85 for specific goods and services if the insurer has granted requests for prior authorization for
86 those goods or services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or more during the
87 previous year. [Sections] Section 21 [and 50 require insurers] requires such an insurer to
88 annually conduct reviews of each provider of health care in the network of the insurer [or who
89 has submitted a request for prior authorization to Medicaid in the immediately preceding 12
90 months, as applicable,] to determine whether each such provider qualifies for an exemption. If
91 the provider qualifies for an exemption, [sections] section 21 [and 50 require] requires the
92 insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods and services, without
93 requiring the provider to affirmatively request an exemption. [Sections] Section 22 [and 51]
94 of this bill [prescribe] prescribes the requirements and procedure for [an] such an insurer to
95 revoke an exemption granted to a provider of health care. [Sections] Section 22 [and 51] also
96 [require an] requires such an insurer to establish a procedure by which a provider of health
97 care may appeal a revocation of an exemption. Section 27 of this bill makes conforming
98 changes to clarify that an insurer may not require prior authorization where prohibited
99 by sections 19-21.
100 Sections [3-16] 4-15 and [35-43] 35-42 of this bill define certain terms relating to the
101 process of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34 of
102 this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 52 of this bill provide
103 that if [an] a private insurer or the Department violates any provision of section [17-20, 27]
104 18-20 or 44-49 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the request is
105 deemed approved. [Sections 23 and 52 also clarify that nothing in any provision of section 17-
106 22, 27 or 44-51 require an insurer to provide coverage: (1) for care that the insurer does not
107 cover, regardless of the medical necessity of the care; or (2) to persons to whom the insured is
108 not obligated to provide coverage.
109 Sections 25 and 53 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its Internet
110 website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that have been
111 processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year. Sections 26 and 54 of this bill
112 additionally require an insurer to publish an annual report of certain information relating to
113 requests for prior authorization processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding
114 year.]
115 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
116 corporation to comply with sections [2-26.] 2-23. Section 29 of this bill requires the Director
117 of the Department [of Health and Human Services] to administer the provisions of sections
118 [33-54] 33-52 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
119 Sections 30, 31 and 56 of this bill require plans of self-insurance for employees of local
120 governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and plans of self-insurance for private
121 employers, respectively, to comply with the requirements of sections [2-26] 2-27 to the extent
122 applicable. Section 33 provides that a managed care organization that provides services to
123 recipients of Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program is not subject to sections
124 [34-54,] 34-52, but must comply with sections [2-26.] 2-27. Section 55 requires the policies
125 and procedures for coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections
126 [34-54.] 34-52.

30 criteria prescribed by subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to
31 obtain prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
32 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the eligibility of the
33 provider of health care to receive an exemption must be independently
34 determined by a provider of health care who:
35 (a) Is licensed in this State;
36 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health care who is
37 being evaluated for an exemption; and
38 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the exemption

8 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
9 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not substantially
10 performed or provided, as applicable.
11 Sec. 22. 1. Not more than once during a single 12-month period, a health
12 carrier may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider of health care to receive an
13 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to section
14 21 of this act.
15 2. A health carrier may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an exemption
16 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization granted to a provider of health

27 criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of an exemption based on a
28 review conducted pursuant to that subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria
29 must be independently determined by a provider of health care described in
30 subsection 2 of section 21 of this act before the health carrier may revoke the
31 exemption.

33 obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2 shall transmit to the provider

36 determination described in subsection 2;
37 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the revoked exemption

48 pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the provider of health care to

15 an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to
16 section 50 of this act.
17 2. The Department may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an exemption

29 criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of an exemption based on a
30 review conducted pursuant to that subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria
31 must be independently determined by a provider of health care described in
32 subsection 2 of section 50 of this act before the Department may revoke the
33 exemption.
