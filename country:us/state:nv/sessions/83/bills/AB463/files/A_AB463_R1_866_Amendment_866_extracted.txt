EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; [imposing requirements governing] requiring
certain health insurers to respond to requests for prior authorization
for medical or dental care [; prohibiting an insurer from requiring prior
authorization for covered emergency services or denying coverage for
covered, medically necessary emergency services;] within a certain
amount of time; prohibiting [an insurer] certain insurers from
requiring prior authorization for certain [other] types of medical care;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
2 insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain circumstances. If an
3 insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure
4 for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
5 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
6 687B.225) [This bill establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior
7 authorization for medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the
8 Children’s Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
9 Section 44 of this bill requires that the procedure for obtaining prior authorization for
10 services reimbursable through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-
11 for-service basis includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services for which the
12 Department of Health and Human Services requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical
13 review criteria used by the Department to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Section 44
14 also requires the Department to publish its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its
15 Internet website and update that website as necessary to account for any changes in the
16 procedure. Section 44 prohibits the Department from denying a claim for payment for medical
17 or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior authorization if the Department’s
18 procedures for obtaining prior authorization in effect on the date on which the care was
19 provided did not require prior authorization for that care.
20 Section] Sections 27 and 45 of this bill [requires the Department to approve or deny such
21 a request, or request additional, medically relevant information] require private insurers and
22 insurers providing coverage for recipients of Medicaid and the Children’s Health
23 Insurance Program, respectively, to respond to a request for prior authorization within
Assembly Amendment No. 866 to Assembly Bill No. 463 First Reprint Page 4
24 [48 hours] 2 business days after receiving the request [. Section 46 of this bill requires any
25 adverse determination on a request for prior authorization for services reimbursable through
26 Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-for-service basis to be made by
27 a physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who is licensed in this State and
28 possesses certain other qualifications. Section 46 requires the Department, in certain
29 circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who requested the prior authorization to
30 discuss the issues involved in the request with the physician or dentist who is responsible for
31 making a determination on the request. Section 46 requires the Department, upon making an
32 adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to
33 the recipient of benefits under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to whom
34 the request pertains, including information relating to the right of the recipient to appeal the
35 adverse determination. Section 46 further requires: (1) the Department to establish a process
36 for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by recipients; and (2) a
37 decision upholding an adverse determination on an appeal submitted by a recipient to be made
38 by a physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or
39 dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization. If the Department approves a
40 request for prior authorization, section 47 of this bill requires the Department to pay the
41 provider of health care the full applicable rate for the relevant care, except in certain
42 circumstances.
43 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that has been
44 approved by a public or private insurer, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health
45 Insurance Program, remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2) treatment related to a chronic
46 condition, until the standard of treatment for that condition changes.] , unless certain
47 nationally recognized operating rules governing prior authorization would allow the
48 insurer to have additional time to respond to the particular request. In such a case,
49 sections 27 and 45 authorize an insurer to respond to the request within the period of
50 time prescribed by the operating rules, unless doing so would result in the insurer
51 responding to the request more than 7 calendar days after receiving the request.
52 Sections 19 and 48 of this bill prohibit [an insurer] insurers from requiring an insured to
53 obtain prior authorization for [certain medical care, including certain preventive care services.
54 Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior authorization for
55 covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an insurer from requiring that an
56 insured or provider of health care notify the insurer earlier than the end of the business day
57 immediately following the date of admission or the date on which the emergency services are
58 provided. Sections 20 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior
59 authorization for certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured
60 within 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
61 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2)
62 establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain conditions.
63 Section 18 prohibits an insurer other than Medicaid from denying or imposing additional
64 limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if the care
65 at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after the date on which the insurer
66 receives the request and certain other requirements are met. Section 21 of this bill requires
67 such an insurer to exempt providers of health care from the requirement to obtain prior
68 authorization for specific goods and services if the insurer has granted requests for prior
69 authorization for those goods or services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or
70 more during the previous year. Section 21 requires such an insurer to annually conduct
71 reviews of each provider of health care in the network of the insurer to determine whether
72 each such provider qualifies for an exemption. If the provider qualifies for an exemption,
73 section 21 requires the insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods
74 and services, without requiring the provider to affirmatively request an exemption. Section 22
75 of this bill prescribes the requirements and procedure for such an insurer to revoke an
76 exemption granted to a provider of health care. Section 22 also requires such an insurer to
77 establish a procedure by which a provider of health care may appeal a revocation of an
78 exemption.] : (1) certain preventive care services; (2) hospice care provided to pediatric
79 patients; and (3) care provided to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome. Section 19
80 additionally prohibits insurers, other than those covering recipients of Medicaid or the
81 Children’s Health Insurance Program, from requiring prior authorization for: (1)
82 outpatient services for the treatment of substance use disorder; and (2) the prescription
Assembly Amendment No. 866 to Assembly Bill No. 463 First Reprint Page 5
83 of test strips for measuring blood glucose in persons with diabetes. Section 27 [of this
84 bill] makes conforming changes to clarify that [an] a private insurer may not require prior
85 authorization where prohibited by [sections 19-21.] section 19.
86 Sections 4-15 and 35-42 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process of
87 obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34 of this bill
88 establish the applicability of those definitions. [Sections] Section 23 [and 52] of this bill
89 [provide] provides that if a private insurer [or the Department] violates any provision of
90 section [18-20 or 44-49] 19 or 27 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization,
91 that the request is deemed approved.
92 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
93 corporation to comply with sections [2-23.] 2-26 of this bill. Section 29 of this bill requires
94 the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of sections 33-52 of this bill in the
95 same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. [Sections 30, 31 and] Section 56 of this
96 bill [require plans of self-insurance for employees of local governments, the Public
97 Employees’ Benefits Program and] requires plans of self-insurance for private employers,
98 respectively, to comply with the requirements of sections [2-27] 19 and 27 to the extent
99 applicable. Section [33] 15.5 of this bill provides that a health maintenance organization or
100 other managed care organization that provides services to recipients of Medicaid or the
101 Children’s Health Insurance Program or members of the Public Employees’ Benefits
102 Program, or a utilization review organization that conducts utilization reviews for such
103 entities, is not subject to sections [34-52, but must comply with sections 2-27. Section 55
104 requires the policies and procedures for coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to
105 comply with sections 34-52.] 2-27.

19 health care to submit a request for the exemption; and
20 (b) Transmit to the provider of health care after granting the exemption a
21 notice that includes:

29 prior authorization submitted by providers of health care who participate in the
30 network of the health carrier to determine whether those providers meet the
31 criteria prescribed by subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to
32 obtain prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
33 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the eligibility of the
34 provider of health care to receive an exemption must be independently
35 determined by a provider of health care who:
36 (a) Is licensed in this State;
37 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health care who is
38 being evaluated for an exemption; and
39 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the exemption
40 has been initially denied.
41 3. A provider of health care who is not granted an exemption from the
42 requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular good or service may,
43 for that specific good or service, request from the health carrier any evidence that
44 supported the decision of the health carrier to not grant the exemption for that
45 good or service. A provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
46 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a single 12-
47 month period for each good or service for which the provider of health care has
48 not been granted an exemption.
49 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
50 pursuant to this section applies to the provision of any good or service covered by
51 the exemption which is provided or ordered by the provider of health care to
52 whom the exception applies.

1 5. A health carrier shall not deny a claim or reduce the amount of payment
2 paid under a claim for a good or service that is subject to an exemption pursuant
3 to this section unless:
4 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim knowingly and
5 materially misrepresented the goods or services actually provided to an insured,
6 and the provider of health care made the misrepresentation with the specific
7 intent to obtain a payment from the health carrier to which the provider of health
8 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
9 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not substantially
10 performed or provided, as applicable.] (Deleted by amendment.)
11 Sec. 22. [1. Not more than once during a single 12-month period, a
12 health carrier may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider of health care to receive
13 an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to
14 section 21 of this act.
15 2. A health carrier may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an exemption
16 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization granted to a provider of health
17 care only if the health carrier determines that the provider of health care would
18 not have met the criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 21 of this act for
19 the good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
20 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider of health care
21 for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months; or
22 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10 claims for that
23 good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months, a retrospective
24 review of at least the last 10 claims submitted by the provider of health care for
25 that good or service.
26 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care meets the
27 criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of an exemption based on a
28 review conducted pursuant to that subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria
29 must be independently determined by a provider of health care described in
30 subsection 2 of section 21 of this act before the health carrier may revoke the
31 exemption.
32 4. A health carrier that revokes an exemption from the requirement to
33 obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2 shall transmit to the provider
34 of health care to which the revocation pertains a notice that includes:
35 (a) The information that the health carrier relied upon when making the
36 determination described in subsection 2;
37 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the revoked exemption
38 applies;

40 than 30 days after the date on which the health carrier transmits the notice; and
41 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language, of how the
42 provider of health care may appeal the revocation pursuant to subsection 5.
43 5. A health carrier shall adopt a procedure by which a provider of health
44 care may appeal the revocation of an exemption from the requirement to obtain
45 prior authorization. If a provider of health care appeals a revocation of such
46 exemption, the exemption must remain in effect:
47 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next reevaluation
48 pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the provider of health care to
49 continue receiving the exemption.
50 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the 5th calendar
51 day after the revocation is upheld or the date contained within the notice sent to
52 the provider of health care pursuant to subsection 4.] (Deleted by amendment.)

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

[CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 30)

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; [imposing requirements governing] requiring
certain health insurers to respond to requests for prior authorization
for medical or dental care [; prohibiting an insurer from requiring prior
authorization for covered emergency services or denying coverage for
covered, medically necessary emergency services;] within a certain
amount of time; prohibiting [an insurer] certain insurers from
requiring prior authorization for certain [other] types of medical care;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
2 insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain circumstances. If an
3 insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure
4 for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
5 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
6 687B.225) [This bill establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior
7 authorization for medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the
8 Children’s Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
9 Section 44 of this bill requires that the procedure for obtaining prior authorization for
10 services reimbursable through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-
11 for-service basis includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services for which the
12 Department of Health and Human Services requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical
13 review criteria used by the Department to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Section 44
14 also requires the Department to publish its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its
15 Internet website and update that website as necessary to account for any changes in the
16 procedure. Section 44 prohibits the Department from denying a claim for payment for medical
17 or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior authorization if the Department’s
18 procedures for obtaining prior authorization in effect on the date on which the care was
19 provided did not require prior authorization for that care.
20 Section] Sections 27 and 45 of this bill [requires the Department to approve or deny such
21 a request, or request additional, medically relevant information] require private insurers and
22 insurers providing coverage for recipients of Medicaid and the Children’s Health
23 Insurance Program, respectively, to respond to a request for prior authorization within

Assembly Amendment No. 866 to Assembly Bill No. 463 First Reprint Page 4
24 [48 hours] 2 business days after receiving the request [. Section 46 of this bill requires any
25 adverse determination on a request for prior authorization for services reimbursable through
26 Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program on a fee-for-service basis to be made by
27 a physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who is licensed in this State and
28 possesses certain other qualifications. Section 46 requires the Department, in certain
29 circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who requested the prior authorization to
30 discuss the issues involved in the request with the physician or dentist who is responsible for
31 making a determination on the request. Section 46 requires the Department, upon making an
32 adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to
33 the recipient of benefits under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to whom
34 the request pertains, including information relating to the right of the recipient to appeal the
35 adverse determination. Section 46 further requires: (1) the Department to establish a process
36 for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by recipients; and (2) a
37 decision upholding an adverse determination on an appeal submitted by a recipient to be made
38 by a physician or dentist who has qualifications beyond those required of a physician or
39 dentist who evaluates initial requests for prior authorization. If the Department approves a
40 request for prior authorization, section 47 of this bill requires the Department to pay the
41 provider of health care the full applicable rate for the relevant care, except in certain
42 circumstances.
43 Sections 18 and 47 of this bill provide that a request for prior authorization that has been
44 approved by a public or private insurer, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health
45 Insurance Program, remains valid for: (1) 12 months; or (2) treatment related to a chronic
46 condition, until the standard of treatment for that condition changes.] , unless certain
47 nationally recognized operating rules governing prior authorization would allow the
48 insurer to have additional time to respond to the particular request. In such a case,
49 sections 27 and 45 authorize an insurer to respond to the request within the period of
50 time prescribed by the operating rules, unless doing so would result in the insurer
51 responding to the request more than 7 calendar days after receiving the request.
52 Sections 19 and 48 of this bill prohibit [an insurer] insurers from requiring an insured to
53 obtain prior authorization for [certain medical care, including certain preventive care services.
54 Sections 20 and 49 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior authorization for
55 covered emergency services. Sections 20 and 49 prohibit an insurer from requiring that an
56 insured or provider of health care notify the insurer earlier than the end of the business day
57 immediately following the date of admission or the date on which the emergency services are
58 provided. Sections 20 and 49 also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior
59 authorization for certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured
60 within 60 minutes after receiving the request. Finally, Sections 20 and 49: (1) prohibit an
61 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2)
62 establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain conditions.
63 Section 18 prohibits an insurer other than Medicaid from denying or imposing additional
64 limits on a request for prior authorization that the insurer has previously approved if the care
65 at issue in the request is provided within 45 business days after the date on which the insurer
66 receives the request and certain other requirements are met. Section 21 of this bill requires
67 such an insurer to exempt providers of health care from the requirement to obtain prior
68 authorization for specific goods and services if the insurer has granted requests for prior
69 authorization for those goods or services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or
70 more during the previous year. Section 21 requires such an insurer to annually conduct
71 reviews of each provider of health care in the network of the insurer to determine whether
72 each such provider qualifies for an exemption. If the provider qualifies for an exemption,
73 section 21 requires the insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods
74 and services, without requiring the provider to affirmatively request an exemption. Section 22
75 of this bill prescribes the requirements and procedure for such an insurer to revoke an
76 exemption granted to a provider of health care. Section 22 also requires such an insurer to
77 establish a procedure by which a provider of health care may appeal a revocation of an
78 exemption.] : (1) certain preventive care services; (2) hospice care provided to pediatric
79 patients; and (3) care provided to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome. Section 19
80 additionally prohibits insurers, other than those covering recipients of Medicaid or the
81 Children’s Health Insurance Program, from requiring prior authorization for: (1)
82 outpatient services for the treatment of substance use disorder; and (2) the prescription

Assembly Amendment No. 866 to Assembly Bill No. 463 First Reprint Page 5
83 of test strips for measuring blood glucose in persons with diabetes. Section 27 [of this
84 bill] makes conforming changes to clarify that [an] a private insurer may not require prior
85 authorization where prohibited by [sections 19-21.] section 19.
86 Sections 4-15 and 35-42 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process of
87 obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 34 of this bill
88 establish the applicability of those definitions. [Sections] Section 23 [and 52] of this bill
89 [provide] provides that if a private insurer [or the Department] violates any provision of
90 section [18-20 or 44-49] 19 or 27 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization,
91 that the request is deemed approved.
92 Section 28 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
93 corporation to comply with sections [2-23.] 2-26 of this bill. Section 29 of this bill requires
94 the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of sections 33-52 of this bill in the
95 same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. [Sections 30, 31 and] Section 56 of this
96 bill [require plans of self-insurance for employees of local governments, the Public
97 Employees’ Benefits Program and] requires plans of self-insurance for private employers,
98 respectively, to comply with the requirements of sections [2-27] 19 and 27 to the extent
99 applicable. Section [33] 15.5 of this bill provides that a health maintenance organization or
100 other managed care organization that provides services to recipients of Medicaid or the
101 Children’s Health Insurance Program or members of the Public Employees’ Benefits
102 Program, or a utilization review organization that conducts utilization reviews for such
103 entities, is not subject to sections [34-52, but must comply with sections 2-27. Section 55
104 requires the policies and procedures for coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to
105 comply with sections 34-52.] 2-27.

11 Sec. 21. [1. A health carrier shall exempt a provider of health care who

13 prior authorization for a specific good or service if, within the immediately
14 preceding 12 months, the health carrier approved 80 percent or more of the
15 requests for prior authorization for that specific good or service submitted by the
16 provider of health care. If a provider of health care qualifies for an exemption
17 pursuant to this section, a health carrier shall:
18 (a) Automatically grant the exemption without requiring the provider of
19 health care to submit a request for the exemption; and
20 (b) Transmit to the provider of health care after granting the exemption a
21 notice that includes:
22 (1) A statement that the provider of health care has been granted an
23 exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization from the health
24 carrier for the specific goods and services listed pursuant to subparagraph (2);
25 (2) A list of goods and services to which the exemption applies; and
26 (3) The date on which the exemption expires, which must not be earlier
27 than 12 months after the date on which the health carrier granted the exemption.
28 2. A health carrier shall provide for an annual review of the requests for
29 prior authorization submitted by providers of health care who participate in the
30 network of the health carrier to determine whether those providers meet the
31 criteria prescribed by subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to
32 obtain prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
33 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the eligibility of the
34 provider of health care to receive an exemption must be independently
35 determined by a provider of health care who:
36 (a) Is licensed in this State;
37 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health care who is
38 being evaluated for an exemption; and
39 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the exemption
40 has been initially denied.
41 3. A provider of health care who is not granted an exemption from the
42 requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular good or service may,
43 for that specific good or service, request from the health carrier any evidence that
44 supported the decision of the health carrier to not grant the exemption for that
45 good or service. A provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
46 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a single 12-
47 month period for each good or service for which the provider of health care has
48 not been granted an exemption.
49 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization
50 pursuant to this section applies to the provision of any good or service covered by
51 the exemption which is provided or ordered by the provider of health care to
52 whom the exception applies.

Assembly Amendment No. 866 to Assembly Bill No. 463 First Reprint Page 9
1 5. A health carrier shall not deny a claim or reduce the amount of payment
2 paid under a claim for a good or service that is subject to an exemption pursuant
3 to this section unless:
4 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim knowingly and
5 materially misrepresented the goods or services actually provided to an insured,
6 and the provider of health care made the misrepresentation with the specific
7 intent to obtain a payment from the health carrier to which the provider of health
8 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
9 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not substantially
10 performed or provided, as applicable.] (Deleted by amendment.)
11 Sec. 22. [1. Not more than once during a single 12-month period, a
12 health carrier may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider of health care to receive
13 an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to
14 section 21 of this act.
15 2. A health carrier may, pursuant to subsection 1, revoke an exemption
16 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization granted to a provider of health
17 care only if the health carrier determines that the provider of health care would
18 not have met the criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 21 of this act for
19 the good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
20 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider of health care
21 for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months; or
22 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10 claims for that
23 good or service during the immediately preceding 3 months, a retrospective
24 review of at least the last 10 claims submitted by the provider of health care for
25 that good or service.
26 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care meets the
27 criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of an exemption based on a
28 review conducted pursuant to that subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria
29 must be independently determined by a provider of health care described in
30 subsection 2 of section 21 of this act before the health carrier may revoke the
31 exemption.
32 4. A health carrier that revokes an exemption from the requirement to
33 obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2 shall transmit to the provider
34 of health care to which the revocation pertains a notice that includes:
35 (a) The information that the health carrier relied upon when making the
36 determination described in subsection 2;
37 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the revoked exemption
38 applies;
39 (c) The date on which the revocation takes effect, which must not be earlier
40 than 30 days after the date on which the health carrier transmits the notice; and
41 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language, of how the
42 provider of health care may appeal the revocation pursuant to subsection 5.
43 5. A health carrier shall adopt a procedure by which a provider of health
44 care may appeal the revocation of an exemption from the requirement to obtain
45 prior authorization. If a provider of health care appeals a revocation of such
46 exemption, the exemption must remain in effect:
47 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next reevaluation
48 pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the provider of health care to
49 continue receiving the exemption.
50 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the 5th calendar
51 day after the revocation is upheld or the date contained within the notice sent to
52 the provider of health care pursuant to subsection 4.] (Deleted by amendment.)
