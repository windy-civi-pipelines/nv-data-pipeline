AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish
certain information relating to the pricing of goods and
services; prohibiting a hospital from collecting medical
debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a
procedure for the correction of violations of that
requirement; authorizing certain investigations, civil
actions and the imposition of certain administrative
sanctions; providing for the publication of certain
information relating to violations; requiring certain health
care entities to provide certain information before taking
any action to collect a medical debt; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
2 charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
3 friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
4 services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
5 (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections 13-15 of this bill codify similar
6 requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13 requires a hospital to
7 compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all items and
8 services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to compile, publish
9 and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable services provided by the hospital; and
10 (2) a list of the shoppable services that appear on a list of certain shoppable services
11 specified by the Federal Government and that the hospital does not provide.
12 Section 15 requires a hospital to publish the lists required by sections 13 and 14 on
13 the most prominent publicly available Internet website maintained by the hospital
14 and requires those lists to remain available for at least 7 years after the date of
-

15 initial publication. Section 15 prescribes additional technical requirements
16 governing the publication of those lists. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to
17 annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning
18 facility fees for outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16
19 requires the Department to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet
20 website.
21 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect
22 a medical debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not
23 in compliance with the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal
24 requirements. Section 17 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken
25 knowingly, constitute deceptive trade practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that
26 commits such a violation to the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for
27 deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Section 17 also
28 authorizes a medical debtor who is aggrieved by such a prohibited action to file a
29 claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
30 General. Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health
31 Advocate to assist patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines
32 that a hospital has taken an action prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical
33 debt, section 17 requires the hospital to cancel the debt and refund any portion of
34 the debt that has been paid.
35 Sections 18-21 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of
36 sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a
37 complaint against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2)
38 requires the Department to monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21.
39 Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the correction of a violation of sections 2-21,
40 and section 20 requires the Department to impose administrative penalties against a
41 hospital that commits such a violation. Section 21 provides for the publication of
42 certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21. Sections 21 and 25 of
43 this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain initial
44 investigatory documents are confidential.
45 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any
46 action to collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized
47 statement of the medical debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical
48 debtor with a receipt for each payment made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a
49 patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a violation of those requirements to
50 bring a civil action against the health care entity. Sections 3-12 of this bill define
51 certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
52 definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
53 applicability of an existing definition.

27 chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391,
28 Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
29 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
30 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
31 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
32 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
33 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
34 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
35 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental

39 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
40 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

42 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
43 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

45 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

4 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
5 confidential.
6 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
7 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
8 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
9 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
10 means of an electronic medium if:
11 (a) The public record:
12 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
13 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
14 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

16 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
17 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
18 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
19 information that is not otherwise confidential.
20 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
21 has legal custody or control of a public record:
22 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

24 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
25 medium.
26 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
27 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
28 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
29 or herself.

31 any medical debt incurred before, on or after January 1, 2026.
32 2. The provisions of section 22 of this act apply to any medical
33 debt incurred on or after January 1, 2026.
34 3. As used in this section, “medical debt” has the meaning
35 ascribed to it in NRS 649.036.

38 approval.
39 2. Sections 1 to 27, inclusive, of this act become effective:

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on April 21, 2025)
FIRST REPRINT A.B. 343
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 343–ASSEMBLYMEMBER YEAGER
MARCH 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Makes revisions relating to health care.
(BDR 40-988)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish
certain information relating to the pricing of goods and
services; prohibiting a hospital from collecting medical
debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a
procedure for the correction of violations of that
requirement; authorizing certain investigations, civil
actions and the imposition of certain administrative
sanctions; providing for the publication of certain
information relating to violations; requiring certain health
care entities to provide certain information before taking
any action to collect a medical debt; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
2 charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
3 friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
4 services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
5 (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections 13-15 of this bill codify similar
6 requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13 requires a hospital to
7 compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all items and
8 services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to compile, publish
9 and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable services provided by the hospital; and
10 (2) a list of the shoppable services that appear on a list of certain shoppable services
11 specified by the Federal Government and that the hospital does not provide.
12 Section 15 requires a hospital to publish the lists required by sections 13 and 14 on
13 the most prominent publicly available Internet website maintained by the hospital
14 and requires those lists to remain available for at least 7 years after the date of
-
*AB343_R1*

– 2 –
15 initial publication. Section 15 prescribes additional technical requirements
16 governing the publication of those lists. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to
17 annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning
18 facility fees for outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16
19 requires the Department to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet
20 website.
21 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect
22 a medical debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not
23 in compliance with the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal
24 requirements. Section 17 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken
25 knowingly, constitute deceptive trade practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that
26 commits such a violation to the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for
27 deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Section 17 also
28 authorizes a medical debtor who is aggrieved by such a prohibited action to file a
29 claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
30 General. Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health
31 Advocate to assist patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines
32 that a hospital has taken an action prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical
33 debt, section 17 requires the hospital to cancel the debt and refund any portion of
34 the debt that has been paid.
35 Sections 18-21 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of
36 sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a
37 complaint against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2)
38 requires the Department to monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21.
39 Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the correction of a violation of sections 2-21,
40 and section 20 requires the Department to impose administrative penalties against a
41 hospital that commits such a violation. Section 21 provides for the publication of
42 certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21. Sections 21 and 25 of
43 this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain initial
44 investigatory documents are confidential.
45 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any
46 action to collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized
47 statement of the medical debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical
48 debtor with a receipt for each payment made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a
49 patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a violation of those requirements to
50 bring a civil action against the health care entity. Sections 3-12 of this bill define
51 certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
52 definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
53 applicability of an existing definition.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 439B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 to 22, inclusive, of this
3 act.
4 Sec. 2. As used in sections 2 to 22, inclusive, of this act,
5 unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined
6 in sections 3 to 12, inclusive, of this act have the meanings
7 ascribed to them in those sections.

19 information that is not otherwise confidential.
20 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who

25 medium.
26 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
27 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
