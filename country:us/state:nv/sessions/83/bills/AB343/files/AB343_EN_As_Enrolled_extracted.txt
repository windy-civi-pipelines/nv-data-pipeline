Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish
certain information relating to the pricing of goods and
services; prohibiting a hospital from collecting medical debt
that accrued while the hospital was out of compliance with
that requirement; prescribing a procedure for the correction
of violations of that requirement; authorizing certain
investigations, civil actions and the imposition of certain
administrative sanctions; providing for the publication of
certain information relating to violations; requiring certain
health care entities to provide certain information before
taking any action to collect a medical debt; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
(45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections 13-15 of this bill codify similar
requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13 requires a hospital to
compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all items and
services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to maintain an
online price-estimator tool or compile, publish and update annually: (1) a list of
shoppable services provided by the hospital; and (2) a list of the shoppable services
that appear on a list of certain shoppable services specified by the Federal
Government and that the hospital does not provide. Section 15 requires a hospital
to publish the most current version of each list required by sections 13 and 14 on
the most prominent publicly available Internet website maintained by the hospital.

Section 2:
Section 15 prescribes certain requirements governing the manner in which those
lists must be published. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to annually report
to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning facility fees for
outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16 requires the
Department to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet website.

Section 3:
Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect
a medical debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not
in compliance with the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal
requirements. Section 17 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken
knowingly, constitute deceptive trade practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that
commits such a violation to the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for
deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Section 17 also
authorizes a medical debtor who is aggrieved by such a prohibited action to file a
claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
General. Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health
Advocate to assist patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines
that a hospital has taken an action prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical
debt, section 17 requires the hospital to cancel the debt and refund any portion of
the debt that has been paid.

Section 4:
Sections 18-21 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of

Section 5:
sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a
complaint against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2)
requires the Department to monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21.

Section 6:
Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the correction of a violation of sections 2-21,
and section 20 requires the Department to impose administrative penalties against a
hospital that commits such a violation. Section 21 provides for the publication of
certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21. Sections 21 and 25 of
this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain initial
investigatory documents are confidential.

Section 7:
Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any
action to collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized
statement of the medical debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical
debtor with a receipt for each payment made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a
patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a violation of those requirements to
file a claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
General. Section 24.5 requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to assist
patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a health care
entity has taken an action to collect a medical debt where prohibited by section 22,

Section 8:
section 22 requires the health care entity to cancel the debt and refund any portion
of the debt that has been paid. Section 22 also provides that attempting to collect a
debt under such prohibited circumstances constitutes a deceptive trade practice.

Section 9:
Sections 3-12 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes
the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make
conforming changes to clarify the applicability of an existing definition.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 343–Assemblymember Yeager
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish
certain information relating to the pricing of goods and
services; prohibiting a hospital from collecting medical debt
that accrued while the hospital was out of compliance with
that requirement; prescribing a procedure for the correction
of violations of that requirement; authorizing certain
investigations, civil actions and the imposition of certain
administrative sanctions; providing for the publication of
certain information relating to violations; requiring certain
health care entities to provide certain information before
taking any action to collect a medical debt; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
(45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections 13-15 of this bill codify similar
requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13 requires a hospital to
compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all items and
services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to maintain an
online price-estimator tool or compile, publish and update annually: (1) a list of
shoppable services provided by the hospital; and (2) a list of the shoppable services
that appear on a list of certain shoppable services specified by the Federal
Government and that the hospital does not provide. Section 15 requires a hospital
to publish the most current version of each list required by sections 13 and 14 on
the most prominent publicly available Internet website maintained by the hospital.
Section 15 prescribes certain requirements governing the manner in which those
lists must be published. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to annually report
to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning facility fees for
outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16 requires the
Department to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet website.
Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect
a medical debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not
in compliance with the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal
requirements. Section 17 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken
knowingly, constitute deceptive trade practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that
commits such a violation to the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed for
deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Section 17 also
authorizes a medical debtor who is aggrieved by such a prohibited action to file a
claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
General. Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health
Advocate to assist patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines
that a hospital has taken an action prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical
debt, section 17 requires the hospital to cancel the debt and refund any portion of
the debt that has been paid.

83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Sections 18-21 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of
sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a
complaint against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2)
requires the Department to monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21.
Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the correction of a violation of sections 2-21,
and section 20 requires the Department to impose administrative penalties against a
hospital that commits such a violation. Section 21 provides for the publication of
certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21. Sections 21 and 25 of
this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain initial
investigatory documents are confidential.
Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any
action to collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized
statement of the medical debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical
debtor with a receipt for each payment made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a
patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a violation of those requirements to
file a claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney
General. Section 24.5 requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to assist
patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a health care
entity has taken an action to collect a medical debt where prohibited by section 22,
section 22 requires the health care entity to cancel the debt and refund any portion
of the debt that has been paid. Section 22 also provides that attempting to collect a
debt under such prohibited circumstances constitutes a deceptive trade practice.
Sections 3-12 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes
the applicability of those definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make
conforming changes to clarify the applicability of an existing definition.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
