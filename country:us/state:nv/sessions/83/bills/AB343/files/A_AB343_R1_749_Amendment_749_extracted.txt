AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish certain information
relating to the pricing of goods and services; prohibiting a hospital
from collecting medical debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a procedure for the
correction of violations of that requirement; authorizing certain
investigations, civil actions and the imposition of certain administrative
sanctions; providing for the publication of certain information relating
to violations; requiring certain health care entities to provide certain
information before taking any action to collect a medical debt;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard charges for
2 all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-friendly list of standard
3 charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are services provided by a hospital that
4 can be scheduled by a consumer in advance. (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections
5 13-15 of this bill codify similar requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13
6 requires a hospital to compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all
7 items and services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to maintain an
8 online price-estimator tool or compile, publish and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable
9 services provided by the hospital; and (2) a list of the shoppable services that appear on a list
10 of certain shoppable services specified by the Federal Government and that the hospital does
11 not provide. Section 15 requires a hospital to publish the [lists] most current version of each
12 list required by sections 13 and 14 on the most prominent publicly available Internet website
13 maintained by the hospital . [and requires those lists to remain available for at least 7 years
14 after the date of initial publication.] Section 15 prescribes [additional technical] certain
15 requirements governing the [publication of] manner in which those lists [.] must be
16 published. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to annually report to the Department of
17 Health and Human Services concerning facility fees for outpatient services provided in off-
18 campus facilities. Section 16 requires the Department to publish those reports on a publicly
19 available Internet website.
20 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect a medical
21 debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not in compliance with
22 the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal requirements. Section 17
Senate Amendment No. 749 to Assembly Bill No. 343 First Reprint Page 4
23 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken knowingly, constitute deceptive trade
24 practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that commits such a violation to the civil and criminal
25 penalties that may be imposed for deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter 598 of NRS)
26 Section 17 also authorizes a medical debtor who is aggrieved by such a prohibited action to
27 file a claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General.
28 Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to assist patients
29 with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a hospital has taken an action
30 prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical debt, section 17 requires the hospital to cancel
31 the debt and refund any portion of the debt that has been paid.
32 Sections 18-21 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of sections 2-21.
33 Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a complaint against a
34 hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2) requires the Department to monitor
35 the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21. Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the
36 correction of a violation of sections 2-21, and section 20 requires the Department to impose
37 administrative penalties against a hospital that commits such a violation. Section 21 provides
38 for the publication of certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21. Sections 21
39 and 25 of this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain initial
40 investigatory documents are confidential.
41 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any action to
42 collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized statement of the medical
43 debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical debtor with a receipt for each payment
44 made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a
45 violation of those requirements to [bring a civil action against the health care entity.] file a
46 claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General.
47 Section 24.5 requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to assist patients with
48 the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a health care entity has taken an
49 action to collect a medical debt where prohibited by section 22, section 22 requires the
50 health care entity to cancel the debt and refund any portion of the debt that has been
51 paid. Section 22 also provides that attempting to collect a debt under such prohibited
52 circumstances constitutes a deceptive trade practice. Sections 3-12 of this bill define
53 certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions.
54 Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of an
55 existing definition.

53 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
Senate Amendment No. 749 to Assembly Bill No. 343 First Reprint Page 18
1 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

3 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
4 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
5 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
6 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
7 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
8 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
9 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
10 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
11 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
12 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
13 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
14 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
15 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
16 record that is not otherwise confidential.
17 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
18 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
19 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
20 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
21 (a) The public record:
22 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
23 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
24 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
25 electronic medium would:
26 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
27 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
28 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
29 otherwise confidential.
30 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
31 custody or control of a public record:
32 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
33 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
34 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
35 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
36 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
37 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
38 Sec. 26. 1. The provisions of section 17 of this act apply to any medical
39 debt incurred before, on or after January 1, 2026.
40 2. The provisions of section 22 of this act apply to any medical debt incurred
41 on or after January 1, 2026.
42 3. As used in this section, “medical debt” has the meaning ascribed to it in
43 NRS 649.036.
44 Sec. 27. NRS 439B.140 is hereby repealed.
45 Sec. 28. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
46 2. Sections 1 to 27, inclusive, of this act become effective:
47 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
48 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
49 out the provisions of this act; and
50 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish certain information
relating to the pricing of goods and services; prohibiting a hospital
from collecting medical debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a procedure for the
correction of violations of that requirement; authorizing certain
investigations, civil actions and the imposition of certain administrative
sanctions; providing for the publication of certain information relating
to violations; requiring certain health care entities to provide certain
information before taking any action to collect a medical debt;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard charges for
2 all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-friendly list of standard
3 charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are services provided by a hospital that
4 can be scheduled by a consumer in advance. (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections
5 13-15 of this bill codify similar requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13
6 requires a hospital to compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all
7 items and services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to maintain an
8 online price-estimator tool or compile, publish and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable
9 services provided by the hospital; and (2) a list of the shoppable services that appear on a list
10 of certain shoppable services specified by the Federal Government and that the hospital does
11 not provide. Section 15 requires a hospital to publish the [lists] most current version of each
12 list required by sections 13 and 14 on the most prominent publicly available Internet website
13 maintained by the hospital . [and requires those lists to remain available for at least 7 years
14 after the date of initial publication.] Section 15 prescribes [additional technical] certain
15 requirements governing the [publication of] manner in which those lists [.] must be
16 published. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to annually report to the Department of
17 Health and Human Services concerning facility fees for outpatient services provided in off-
18 campus facilities. Section 16 requires the Department to publish those reports on a publicly
19 available Internet website.
20 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect a medical
21 debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not in compliance with
22 the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal requirements. Section 17

Senate Amendment No. 749 to Assembly Bill No. 343 First Reprint Page 4
23 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken knowingly, constitute deceptive trade
24 practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that commits such a violation to the civil and criminal
25 penalties that may be imposed for deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter 598 of NRS)
26 Section 17 also authorizes a medical debtor who is aggrieved by such a prohibited action to
27 file a claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General.
28 Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to assist patients
29 with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a hospital has taken an action
30 prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical debt, section 17 requires the hospital to cancel
31 the debt and refund any portion of the debt that has been paid.
32 Sections 18-21 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of sections 2-21.
33 Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a complaint against a
34 hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2) requires the Department to monitor
35 the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21. Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the
36 correction of a violation of sections 2-21, and section 20 requires the Department to impose
37 administrative penalties against a hospital that commits such a violation. Section 21 provides
38 for the publication of certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21. Sections 21
39 and 25 of this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain initial
40 investigatory documents are confidential.
41 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any action to
42 collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized statement of the medical
43 debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical debtor with a receipt for each payment
44 made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a
45 violation of those requirements to [bring a civil action against the health care entity.] file a
46 claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General.
47 Section 24.5 requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to assist patients with
48 the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a health care entity has taken an
49 action to collect a medical debt where prohibited by section 22, section 22 requires the
50 health care entity to cancel the debt and refund any portion of the debt that has been
51 paid. Section 22 also provides that attempting to collect a debt under such prohibited
52 circumstances constitutes a deceptive trade practice. Sections 3-12 of this bill define
53 certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions.
54 Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of an
55 existing definition.

1 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
2 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
3 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
4 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
5 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
6 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
7 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
8 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
9 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
10 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
11 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
12 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
13 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
14 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
15 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
16 record that is not otherwise confidential.
17 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
18 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
19 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
20 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
21 (a) The public record:
22 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
23 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
24 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
25 electronic medium would:
26 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
27 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
28 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
29 otherwise confidential.
30 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
31 custody or control of a public record:
32 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
33 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
34 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
35 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
36 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
37 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
38 Sec. 26. 1. The provisions of section 17 of this act apply to any medical
39 debt incurred before, on or after January 1, 2026.
40 2. The provisions of section 22 of this act apply to any medical debt incurred
41 on or after January 1, 2026.
42 3. As used in this section, “medical debt” has the meaning ascribed to it in
43 NRS 649.036.
44 Sec. 27. NRS 439B.140 is hereby repealed.
45 Sec. 28. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
46 2. Sections 1 to 27, inclusive, of this act become effective:
47 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
48 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
49 out the provisions of this act; and
50 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
