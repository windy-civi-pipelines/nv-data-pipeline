AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish certain information
relating to the pricing of goods and services; prohibiting a hospital
from collecting medical debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a procedure for the
correction of violations of that requirement; authorizing certain
investigations, civil actions and the imposition of certain
administrative sanctions; providing for the publication of certain
information relating to violations; requiring certain health care entities
to provide certain information before taking any action to collect a
medical debt; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard charges for
2 all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-friendly list of standard
3 charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are services provided by a hospital that
4 can be scheduled by a consumer in advance. (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections
5 13-15 of this bill codify similar requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13
6 requires a hospital to compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all
7 items and services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to compile, publish
8 and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable services provided by the hospital; and (2) a list of
9 the shoppable services that appear on a list of certain shoppable services specified by the
10 Federal Government and that the hospital does not provide. Section 15 requires a hospital to
11 publish the lists required by sections 13 and 14 on the most prominent publicly available
12 Internet website maintained by the hospital and requires those lists to remain available for at
13 least 7 years after the date of initial publication. Section 15 prescribes additional technical
14 requirements governing the publication of those lists. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital
15 to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning facility fees
16 for outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16 requires the Department
17 to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet website.
18 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect a medical
19 debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not in compliance with
20 the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal requirements. Section 17
21 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken knowingly, constitute deceptive trade
22 practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that commits such a violation to the civil and
Assembly Amendment No. 450 to Assembly Bill No. 343 Page 4
23 criminal penalties that may be imposed for deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter
24 598 of NRS) Section 17 also authorizes a [patient or] medical debtor who is aggrieved by
25 such a [violation of those requirements] prohibited action to [bring a civil action against the
26 hospital.] file a claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
27 Attorney General. Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health
28 Advocate to assist patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a
29 hospital has taken an action prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical debt, section 17
30 requires the hospital to cancel the debt and refund any portion of the debt that has been
31 paid.
32 Sections 18-21 [and 24] of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of
33 sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a complaint
34 against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2) requires the Department to
35 monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21. Section 19 prescribes a procedure for
36 the correction of a violation of sections 2-21, and section 20 requires the Department to
37 impose administrative penalties against a hospital that commits such a violation. [Section 24
38 additionally authorizes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department to
39 suspend or revoke the license of a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21.] Section 21
40 provides for the publication of certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21.
41 Sections 21 and 25 of this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain
42 initial investigatory documents are confidential.
43 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any action to
44 collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized statement of the medical
45 debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical debtor with a receipt for each payment
46 made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a
47 violation of those requirements to bring a civil action against the health care entity. Sections
48 3-12 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of
49 those definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
50 applicability of an existing definition.

16 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
17 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
18 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
19 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
20 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
21 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
22 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
23 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
24 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
25 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
26 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
27 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
28 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
29 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
30 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
31 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
32 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
33 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
34 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
35 record that is not otherwise confidential.
36 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
37 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
38 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
39 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
40 (a) The public record:
41 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
42 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
43 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
44 electronic medium would:
45 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
46 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
47 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
48 otherwise confidential.
49 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
50 custody or control of a public record:
51 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
52 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
53 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
Assembly Amendment No. 450 to Assembly Bill No. 343 Page 19
1 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
2 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
3 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
4 Sec. 26. 1. The provisions of section 17 of this act apply to any medical
5 debt incurred before, on or after January 1, 2026.
6 2. The provisions of section 22 of this act apply to any medical debt incurred
7 on or after January 1, 2026.
8 3. As used in this section, “medical debt” has the meaning ascribed to it in
9 NRS 649.036.
10 Sec. 27. NRS 439B.140 is hereby repealed.
11 Sec. 28. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
12 2. Sections 1 to 27, inclusive, of this act become effective:
13 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
14 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
15 out the provisions of this act; and
16 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish certain information
relating to the pricing of goods and services; prohibiting a hospital
from collecting medical debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a procedure for the
correction of violations of that requirement; authorizing certain
investigations, civil actions and the imposition of certain
administrative sanctions; providing for the publication of certain
information relating to violations; requiring certain health care entities
to provide certain information before taking any action to collect a
medical debt; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard charges for
2 all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-friendly list of standard
3 charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are services provided by a hospital that
4 can be scheduled by a consumer in advance. (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections
5 13-15 of this bill codify similar requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13
6 requires a hospital to compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all
7 items and services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to compile, publish
8 and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable services provided by the hospital; and (2) a list of
9 the shoppable services that appear on a list of certain shoppable services specified by the
10 Federal Government and that the hospital does not provide. Section 15 requires a hospital to
11 publish the lists required by sections 13 and 14 on the most prominent publicly available
12 Internet website maintained by the hospital and requires those lists to remain available for at
13 least 7 years after the date of initial publication. Section 15 prescribes additional technical
14 requirements governing the publication of those lists. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital
15 to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning facility fees
16 for outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16 requires the Department
17 to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet website.
18 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect a medical
19 debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not in compliance with
20 the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal requirements. Section 17
21 provides that such prohibited actions, when taken knowingly, constitute deceptive trade
22 practices, thereby subjecting a hospital that commits such a violation to the civil and

Assembly Amendment No. 450 to Assembly Bill No. 343 Page 4
23 criminal penalties that may be imposed for deceptive trade practices generally. (Chapter
24 598 of NRS) Section 17 also authorizes a [patient or] medical debtor who is aggrieved by
25 such a [violation of those requirements] prohibited action to [bring a civil action against the
26 hospital.] file a claim with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
27 Attorney General. Section 24.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health
28 Advocate to assist patients with the filing of such claims. If the Bureau determines that a
29 hospital has taken an action prohibited by section 17 to collect a medical debt, section 17
30 requires the hospital to cancel the debt and refund any portion of the debt that has been
31 paid.
32 Sections 18-21 [and 24] of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement of
33 sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file a complaint
34 against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2) requires the Department to
35 monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21. Section 19 prescribes a procedure for
36 the correction of a violation of sections 2-21, and section 20 requires the Department to
37 impose administrative penalties against a hospital that commits such a violation. [Section 24
38 additionally authorizes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department to
39 suspend or revoke the license of a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21.] Section 21
40 provides for the publication of certain documents relating to violations of sections 2-21.
41 Sections 21 and 25 of this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a violation and certain
42 initial investigatory documents are confidential.
43 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any action to
44 collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized statement of the medical
45 debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical debtor with a receipt for each payment
46 made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a
47 violation of those requirements to bring a civil action against the health care entity. Sections
48 3-12 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of
49 those definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
50 applicability of an existing definition.

18 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
19 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
20 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

24 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
25 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
26 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
27 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

35 record that is not otherwise confidential.
36 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
37 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

39 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
40 (a) The public record:
41 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
42 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
43 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
44 electronic medium would:
45 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
46 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
47 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
48 otherwise confidential.
49 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
50 custody or control of a public record:
51 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
52 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
53 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.

Assembly Amendment No. 450 to Assembly Bill No. 343 Page 19
