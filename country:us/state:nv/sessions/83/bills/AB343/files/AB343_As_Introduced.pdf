AN ACT relating to health care; requiring hospitals to publish
certain information relating to the pricing of goods and
services; prohibiting a hospital from collecting medical
debt that accrued while the hospital was out of
compliance with that requirement; prescribing a
procedure for the correction of violations of that
requirement; authorizing certain civil actions and the
imposition of certain administrative sanctions; providing
for the publication of certain information relating to
violations; requiring certain health care entities to provide
certain information before taking any action to collect a
medical debt; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
2 charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
3 friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
4 services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
5 (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Sections 13-15 of this bill codify similar
6 requirements into Nevada law. Specifically, section 13 requires a hospital to
7 compile, publish and update annually a list of standard charges for all items and
8 services provided by the hospital. Section 14 requires a hospital to compile, publish
9 and update annually: (1) a list of shoppable services provided by the hospital; and
10 (2) a list of the shoppable services that appear on a list of certain shoppable services
11 specified by the Federal Government and that the hospital does not provide.
12 Section 15 requires a hospital to publish the lists required by sections 13 and 14 on
13 the most prominent publicly available Internet website maintained by the hospital
14 and requires those lists to remain available for at least 7 years after the date of
-

15 initial publication. Section 15 prescribes additional technical requirements
16 governing the publication of those lists. Section 16 of this bill requires a hospital to
17 annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services concerning
18 facility fees for outpatient services provided in off-campus facilities. Section 16
19 requires the Department to publish those reports on a publicly available Internet
20 website.
21 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a hospital from taking certain actions to collect
22 a medical debt for goods or services provided to a patient while the hospital is not
23 in compliance with the requirements of sections 13-15 or the corresponding federal
24 requirements. Section 17 authorizes a patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved
25 by a violation of those requirements to bring a civil action against the hospital.
26 Sections 18-21 and 24 of this bill provide for the administrative enforcement
27 of sections 2-21. Specifically, section 18: (1) authorizes any person or entity to file
28 a complaint against a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21; and (2)
29 requires the Department to monitor the compliance of hospitals with sections 2-21.
30 Section 19 prescribes a procedure for the correction of a violation of sections 2-21,
31 and section 20 requires the Department to impose administrative penalties against a
32 hospital that commits such a violation. Section 24 additionally authorizes the
33 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department to suspend or revoke
34 the license of a hospital that fails to comply with sections 2-21. Section 21
35 provides for the publication of certain documents relating to violations of sections
36 2-21. Sections 21 and 25 of this bill provide that a complaint alleging such a
37 violation and certain initial investigatory documents are confidential.
38 Section 22 of this bill requires certain health care entities, before taking any
39 action to collect a medical debt, to provide: (1) the patient with an itemized
40 statement of the medical debt and certain other information; and (2) the medical
41 debtor with a receipt for each payment made on the debt. Section 22 authorizes a
42 patient or medical debtor who is aggrieved by a violation of those requirements to
43 bring a civil action against the health care entity. Sections 3-12 of this bill define
44 certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
45 definitions. Sections 23 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
46 applicability of an existing definition.
