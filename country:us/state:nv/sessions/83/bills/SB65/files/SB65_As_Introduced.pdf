SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain records of
investigations of deaths. (BDR 20-452)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to coroners; providing, with certain exceptions,
that the final report of a coroner concerning certain
investigations of deaths is a public record; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, all sheriffs in this State are ex
2 officio coroners. (NRS 259.020) Existing law requires a coroner to conduct an
3 investigation when the coroner or the coroner’s deputy is informed that a person
4 has been killed, has committed suicide or has suddenly died under certain
5 circumstances. (NRS 259.050) Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain
6 exceptions, that the final report of a coroner for the investigation is a public record.
7 Section 2 also: (1) authorizes a coroner to redact or withhold from public disclosure
8 certain information, records, documents or materials under certain circumstances;
9 and (2) provides that, with certain exceptions, certain records, documents and
10 materials contained in the case file or final report of a coroner for the investigation
11 are confidential.
12 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to create the office of
13 the county coroner by ordinance and prescribe the qualifications and duties of the
14 county coroner. (NRS 244.163) If created, the office of county coroner enacted by
15 ordinance is governed by the ordinance and certain provisions of existing law
16 relating to coroners. (NRS 244.163, 259.010) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill provide
17 that the case files and final reports of a coroner whose office is enacted by
18 ordinance are also governed by the provisions of section 2.
19 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that certain records
20 are confidential pursuant to section 2.

8 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes
9 of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
10 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
11 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
12 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
13 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
14 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
15 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
16 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
17 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
18 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
19 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
20 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
21 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
22 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
23 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
24 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
25 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
26 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
27 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
28 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,

30 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
31 confidential.

36 means of an electronic medium if:
37 (a) The public record:
38 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
39 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
40 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
41 means of an electronic medium would:
42 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
43 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
44 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
