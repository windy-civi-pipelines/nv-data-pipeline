AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions relating to the employment of
children; providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Fair Labor Standards Act and existing state law establish certain standards
2 relating to the employment of children. (29 U.S.C. § 212, 29 C.F.R. Part 570; chapter 609 of
3 NRS) When such federal and state standards are different, the standards that provide the most
4 protection to children apply. (29 U.S.C. § 218) With certain exceptions, both existing federal
5 and state law restrict the daily and weekly number of hours worked in authorized employment
6 by children who are 14 and 15 years of age. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35; NRS 609.240) In part,
7 existing state law prohibits children who are 14 and 15 years of age from being employed,
8 subject to certain exceptions, more than 48 hours in any 1 week. (NRS 609.240) Section 2 of
9 this bill reduces the maximum allowable number of weekly work hours under this prohibition
10 to 40 hours in any 1 week. With the exception of working as certain messengers, existing state
11 law does not place restrictions on the times of day worked in authorized employment by
12 children who are 14 years of age and older and under 18 years of age. (NRS 609.230,
13 609.240) However, existing federal law limits the times of day worked in authorized
14 employment by children who are 14 and 15 years of age to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., except between
15 June 1 and Labor Day when the evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35)
16 Section 2 prohibits, with certain exceptions, work between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. on any night
17 immediately preceding a school day by a child who is: (1) enrolled in high school at a public
18 or private school; (2) 16 years of age or older and under 19 years of age; and (3) not
19 emancipated. Section 2 exempts from this time restriction the employment of a child as a
20 lifeguard, employee of an arcade or stage or theatrical performer. Section 2 authorizes a
21 school district or other governing body of the high school or juvenile court to grant an
22 exemption from this time restriction in certain circumstances.
23 A person who violates the prohibitions relating to the employment of children: (1) is
24 guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
25 than 6 months, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2)
26 may be liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS 193.150, 609.650, 609.652) These penalties
27 apply to persons who violate the maximum allowable number of weekly work hours or time
28 restrictions in section 2.

29 Section 1.7 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of the
30 federal Fair Labor Standards Act, or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto, relating
31 to the hours of work and conditions of employment permitted for a child under 16 years
32 of age is subject to these penalties.
33 Existing law requires every employer in this State to conspicuously post on the premises
34 where any person is employed a printed abstract, furnished by the Labor Commissioner, of the
35 provisions relating to compensation, wages and hours of employment. (NRS 608.013) Section
36 [1] 1.3 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to prepare an abstract of the provisions
37 relating to the employment of children and post the abstract to the Internet website maintained
38 by the Office of Labor Commissioner. Section [1] 1.3 also requires the Labor Commissioner
39 to include the abstract relating to the employment of children in a two-dimensional bar code,
40 commonly known as a QR code, or other machine-readable bar code used for storing an
41 Internet address, in the abstract relating to compensation, wages and hours of employment that
42 the Labor Commissioner is required to furnish to every employer in this State.

11 Sec. 1.7. A violation of any provision of the federal Fair Labor Standards

30 inclusive.
31  A school district or other governing body of the high school or juvenile court
32 may grant an exemption from the restrictions of this subsection if the school
33 district, governing body or juvenile court, as applicable, determines the
34 exemption is in the best interest of the child.
