EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions relating to the employment of
children; providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Fair Labor Standards Act and existing state law establish certain standards
2 relating to the employment of children. (29 U.S.C. § 212, 29 C.F.R. Part 570; chapter 609 of
3 NRS) When such federal and state standards are different, the standards that provide the most
4 protection to children apply. (29 U.S.C. § 218) With certain exceptions, both existing federal
5 and state law restrict the daily and weekly number of hours worked in authorized employment
6 by children who are 14 and 15 years of age. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35; NRS 609.240) In part,
7 existing state law prohibits children who are 14 and 15 years of age from being
8 employed, subject to certain exceptions, more than 48 hours in any 1 week. (NRS
9 609.240) Section 2 of this bill reduces the maximum allowable number of weekly work
10 hours under this prohibition to 40 hours in any 1 week. With the exception of working as
11 certain messengers, existing state law does not place restrictions on the times of day worked in
12 authorized employment by children who are 14 years of age and older and under 18 years of
13 age. (NRS 609.230, 609.240) However, existing federal law limits the times of day worked in
14 authorized employment by children who are 14 and 15 years of age to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., except
15 between June 1 and Labor Day when the evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. (29 C.F.R. §
16 570.35) Section 2 [of this bill] prohibits, with certain exceptions, work between [10] 11 p.m.
17 and [5] 6 a.m. on any night immediately preceding a school day by a child who is: (1) enrolled
18 in high school [;] at a public or private school; (2) 16 years of age or older and under 19
19 years of age; and (3) not emancipated. Section 2 exempts from this time restriction the
20 employment of a child as a lifeguard, employee of an arcade or stage or theatrical
21 performer. Section 2 authorizes a school district or other governing body of the high
22 school or juvenile court to grant an exemption from this time restriction in certain
23 circumstances.
24 A person who violates the prohibitions relating to the employment of children: (1) is
25 guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
26 than 6 months, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2)
27 may be liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS 193.150, 609.650, 609.652) These penalties
28 apply to persons who violate the maximum allowable number of weekly work hours or
29 time restrictions in section 2.

Assembly Amendment No. 30 to Assembly Bill No. 215 Page 4
30 Existing law requires every employer in this State to conspicuously post on the premises
31 where any person is employed a printed abstract, furnished by the Labor Commissioner, of the
32 provisions relating to compensation, wages and hours of employment. (NRS 608.013) Section
33 1 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner to prepare an abstract of the provisions relating
34 to the employment of children and post the abstract to the Internet website maintained by the
35 Office of Labor Commissioner. Section 1 also requires the Labor Commissioner to include
36 the abstract relating to the employment of children in a two-dimensional bar code, commonly
37 known as a QR code, or other machine-readable bar code used for storing an Internet address,
38 in the abstract relating to compensation, wages and hours of employment that the Labor
39 Commissioner is required to furnish to every employer in this State.
