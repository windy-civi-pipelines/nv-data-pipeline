AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions relating to the
employment of children; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Fair Labor Standards Act and existing state law establish certain
2 standards relating to the employment of children. (29 U.S.C. § 212, 29 C.F.R. Part
3 570; chapter 609 of NRS) When such federal and state standards are different, the
4 standards that provide the most protection to children apply. (29 U.S.C. § 218)
5 With certain exceptions, both existing federal and state law restrict the daily and
6 weekly number of hours worked in authorized employment by children who are 14
7 and 15 years of age. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35; NRS 609.240) In part, existing state law
8 prohibits children who are 14 and 15 years of age from being employed, subject to
9 certain exceptions, more than 48 hours in any 1 week. (NRS 609.240) Section 2 of
10 this bill reduces the maximum allowable number of weekly work hours under this
11 prohibition to 40 hours in any 1 week. With the exception of working as certain
12 messengers, existing state law does not place restrictions on the times of day
13 worked in authorized employment by children who are 14 years of age and older
14 and under 18 years of age. (NRS 609.230, 609.240) However, existing federal law
15 limits the times of day worked in authorized employment by children who are 14
16 and 15 years of age to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., except between June 1 and Labor Day when
17 the evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35) Section 2 prohibits,
18 with certain exceptions, work between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. on any night immediately
19 preceding a school day by a child who is: (1) enrolled in high school at a public or
20 private school; (2) 16 years of age or older and under 19 years of age; and (3) not
21 emancipated. Section 2 exempts from this time restriction the employment of
22 a child as a lifeguard, employee of an arcade or stage or theatrical performer.
23 Section 2 authorizes a school district or other governing body of the high school or
-

– 2 –
24 juvenile court to grant an exemption from this time restriction in certain
25 circumstances.
26 A person who violates the prohibitions relating to the employment of children:
27 (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punishable by imprisonment in the county
28 jail for not more than 6 months, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both
29 fine or imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS
30 193.150, 609.650, 609.652) These penalties apply to persons who violate the
31 maximum allowable number of weekly work hours or time restrictions in section 2.
32 Section 1.7 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of the
33 federal Fair Labor Standards Act, or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto,
34 relating to the hours of work and conditions of employment permitted for a child
35 under 16 years of age is subject to these penalties.
36 Existing law requires every employer in this State to conspicuously post on the
37 premises where any person is employed a printed abstract, furnished by the Labor
38 Commissioner, of the provisions relating to compensation, wages and hours of
39 employment. (NRS 608.013) Section 1.3 of this bill requires the Labor
40 Commissioner to prepare an abstract of the provisions relating to the employment
41 of children and post the abstract to the Internet website maintained by the Office of
42 Labor Commissioner. Section 1.3 also requires the Labor Commissioner to include
43 the abstract relating to the employment of children in a two-dimensional bar code,
44 commonly known as a QR code, or other machine-readable bar code used for
45 storing an Internet address, in the abstract relating to compensation, wages and
46 hours of employment that the Labor Commissioner is required to furnish to every
47 employer in this State.

13 129.140, inclusive.
14  A school district or other governing body of the high school or
15 juvenile court may grant an exemption from the restrictions of this
16 subsection if the school district, governing body or juvenile court,
17 as applicable, determines the exemption is in the best interest of
18 the child.
19 3. The presence of a child in any establishment during working
20 hours is prima facie evidence of employment of the child therein.
21 4. As used in this section:

23 NRS 394.103.
24 (b) “Public school” has the meaning ascribed to it in
25 NRS 385.007.
