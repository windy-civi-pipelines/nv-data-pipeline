EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions relating to the
employment of children; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Fair Labor Standards Act and existing state law establish certain
2 standards relating to the employment of children. (29 U.S.C. § 212, 29 C.F.R. Part
3 570; chapter 609 of NRS) When such federal and state standards are different, the
4 standards that provide the most protection to children apply. (29 U.S.C. § 218)
5 With certain exceptions, both existing federal and state law restrict the daily and
6 weekly number of hours worked in authorized employment by children who are 14
7 and 15 years of age. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35; NRS 609.240) In part, existing state law
8 prohibits children who are 14 and 15 years of age from being employed, subject to
9 certain exceptions, more than 48 hours in any 1 week. (NRS 609.240) Section 2 of
10 this bill reduces the maximum allowable number of weekly work hours under this
11 prohibition to 40 hours in any 1 week. With the exception of working as certain
12 messengers, existing state law does not place restrictions on the times of day
13 worked in authorized employment by children who are 14 years of age and older
14 and under 18 years of age. (NRS 609.230, 609.240) However, existing federal law
15 limits the times of day worked in authorized employment by children who are 14
16 and 15 years of age to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., except between June 1 and Labor Day when
17 the evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. (29 C.F.R. § 570.35) Section 2 prohibits,
18 with certain exceptions, work between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. on any night immediately
19 preceding a school day by a child who is: (1) enrolled in high school at a public or
20 private school; (2) 16 years of age or older and under 19 years of age; and (3) not
21 emancipated. Section 2 exempts from this time restriction the employment of a
22 child as a lifeguard, employee of an arcade or stage or theatrical performer. Section
-
*AB215_R1*
– 2 –
23 2 authorizes a school district or other governing body of the high school or juvenile
24 court to grant an exemption from this time restriction in certain circumstances.
25 A person who violates the prohibitions relating to the employment of children:
26 (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punishable by imprisonment in the county
27 jail for not more than 6 months, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or by both
28 fine or imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS
29 193.150, 609.650, 609.652) These penalties apply to persons who violate the
30 maximum allowable number of weekly work hours or time restrictions in section 2.
31 Existing law requires every employer in this State to conspicuously post on the
32 premises where any person is employed a printed abstract, furnished by the Labor
33 Commissioner, of the provisions relating to compensation, wages and hours of
34 employment. (NRS 608.013) Section 1 of this bill requires the Labor
35 Commissioner to prepare an abstract of the provisions relating to the employment
36 of children and post the abstract to the Internet website maintained by the Office of
37 Labor Commissioner. Section 1 also requires the Labor Commissioner to include
38 the abstract relating to the employment of children in a two-dimensional bar code,
39 commonly known as a QR code, or other machine-readable bar code used for
40 storing an Internet address, in the abstract relating to compensation, wages and
41 hours of employment that the Labor Commissioner is required to furnish to every
42 employer in this State.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 609 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 The Labor Commissioner shall:

5 2. Post the abstract on the Internet website maintained by the
6 Office of Labor Commissioner; and
7 3. Include the abstract in a two-dimensional bar code,
8 commonly known as a QR code, or other machine-readable
9 barcode used for storing an Internet address, in any abstract
10 furnished to an employer pursuant to NRS 608.013.
11 Sec. 2. NRS 609.240 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 609.240 1. No child under the age of 16 years may be
13 employed, permitted or suffered to work at any gainful occupation,
14 other than employment as a performer in the production of a motion
15 picture or work on a farm, more than [48] 40 hours in any 1 week,
16 or more than 8 hours in any 1 day.
17 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
18 609.230, no child may be employed, permitted or suffered to work
19 at any gainful occupation, other than employment as a lifeguard,
20 employee of an arcade, stage or theatrical performer or performer
21 in the production of a motion picture or work on a farm, between
22 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. on any night immediately preceding a school
23 day if the child:
24 (a) Is enrolled in high school at a public or private school;

2 (c) Is not declared emancipated pursuant to NRS 129.080 to
3 129.140, inclusive.
4  A school district or other governing body of the high school or
5 juvenile court may grant an exemption from the restrictions of this
6 subsection if the school district, governing body or juvenile court,
7 as applicable, determines the exemption is in the best interest of
8 the child.
9 3. The presence of a child in any establishment during working
10 hours is prima facie evidence of employment of the child therein.
11 4. As used in this section:
12 (a) “Private school” has the meaning ascribed to it in
13 NRS 394.103.
14 (b) “Public school” has the meaning ascribed to it in
15 NRS 385.007.
