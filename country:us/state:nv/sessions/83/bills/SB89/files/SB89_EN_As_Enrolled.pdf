Senate Bill No. 89–Senator Pazina
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to crimes; prohibiting the purchase, possession or
ownership of a firearm by a person who has been convicted
of committing or attempting to commit a crime motivated by
certain characteristics of the victim; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that if a person commits certain crimes ordinarily
punishable as misdemeanors because of certain characteristics of the victim
including race, color, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual
orientation or gender identity or expression, then the crime committed is punishable
as a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 207.185) Existing law also prohibits a person from
owning or having in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control any
firearm if that person has been convicted of certain crimes. (NRS 202.360) Section
1 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing, owning or having in his or her
possession or under his or her custody or control any firearm if the person has been
convicted within the immediately preceding 10 years of committing or attempting
to commit certain offenses that: (1) are punishable under the laws of this State as
gross misdemeanors because the conduct of the offender was motivated by certain
characteristics of the victim; or (2) under the laws of the United States or any state,
territory or district, require that the conduct of the offender was motivated by
certain characteristics of the victim or resulted in a court imposing an additional
penalty based on a finding that the conduct of the offender was motivated by
certain characteristics of the victim. Section 1 also prohibits a person from
purchasing, owning or having in his or her possession or under his or her custody or
control any firearm if the person has been convicted of committing or attempting to
commit certain offenses involving violence that are motivated by certain
characteristics of the victim. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
provide that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of section 1, each firearm
purchased by a person constitutes a separate violation.
Section 3 of this bill provides that a person who was convicted of certain
offenses described in section 1 before July 1, 2025, is not prohibited from owning
or having in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control any firearm
that the person legally owned before July 1, 2025.
