EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; prohibiting the purchase, possession or
ownership of a firearm by a person who has been
convicted of committing or attempting to commit a crime
motivated by certain characteristics of the victim; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits certain crimes ordinarily
2 punishable as misdemeanors because of certain characteristics of the victim
3 including race, color, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual
4 orientation or gender identity or expression, then the crime committed is punishable
5 as a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 207.185) Existing law also prohibits a person from
6 owning or having in his or her possession or under his or her custody or control any
7 firearm if that person has been convicted of certain crimes. (NRS 202.360) Section
8 1 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing, owning or having in his or her
9 possession or under his or her custody or control any firearm if the person has been
10 convicted within the immediately preceding 10 years of committing or attempting
11 to commit certain offenses that: (1) are punishable under the laws of this State as
12 gross misdemeanors because the conduct of the offender was motivated by certain
13 characteristics of the victim; or (2) under the laws of the United States or any state,
14 territory or district, require that the conduct of the offender was motivated by
15 certain characteristics of the victim or resulted in a court imposing an additional
16 penalty based on a finding that the conduct of the offender was motivated by
17 certain characteristics of the victim. Section 1 also prohibits a person from
18 purchasing, owning or having in his or her possession or under his or her custody or
19 control any firearm if the person has been convicted of committing or attempting to
20 commit certain offenses involving violence that are motivated by certain
21 characteristics of the victim. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
22 provide that, for purposes of prosecuting a violation of section 1, each firearm
23 purchased by a person constitutes a separate violation.
