EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; removing and repealing
provisions relating to vicarious liability; revising
provisions governing comparative negligence; requiring a
trier of fact to consider the fault of all persons, including
persons not named as a party, in an action to recover
damages for death or injury to persons or for injury to
property; authorizing the admission of certain evidence in
certain civil actions; limiting the amount of medical
expenses recoverable as damages in certain civil actions;
limiting the amount of fees that a private attorney or
representative may receive in proceedings under the
Nevada Industrial Insurance Act; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 A common law doctrine, known as “vicarious liability,” generally provides that
2 a principal party is responsible for the actions of the agent of the principal. Existing
3 law provides: (1) whenever any person suffers personal injury by wrongful act,
4 neglect or default of another, the person causing the injury is liable to the person
5 injured for damages; and (2) with certain exceptions, where the person causing the
6 injury is employed by another person or corporation responsible for the conduct of
7 the person causing the injury, the other person or corporation is liable to the person
8 injured for damages. (NRS 41.130) Section 2 of this bill instead provides that only
9 the person causing the injury is liable to the person injured and removes the
10 provisions of existing law providing for liability on the employer for the actions of
11 the person who caused the injury. Section 10 of this bill repeals the existing
12 provisions of law which set forth certain limitations on the liability of the employer,
13 and section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a reference to the
14 provisions repealed by section 10.

15 Existing law provides that in any action to recover damages for death or injury
16 to persons or property where comparative negligence is asserted as a defense, the
17 comparative negligence of the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s decedent does not bar
18 recovery if that negligence was not greater than the negligence or gross negligence
19 of the parties against whom recovery is sought. If the jury determines that the
20 plaintiff is entitled to recover in such a case, existing law requires the jury to return:
21 (1) a general verdict with the total amount of damages the plaintiff would be
22 entitled to recover notwithstanding the plaintiff’s comparative negligence; and (2) a
23 special verdict indicating the percentage of negligence assigned to each party
24 remaining in the action. Existing law further requires that, in an action where a
25 plaintiff may recover from more than one defendant, each defendant is severally
26 liable to the plaintiff only for that portion of the judgment representing the
27 percentage of negligence assigned to that defendant. Existing law also contains
28 exceptions for certain causes of action where the doctrine of joint and several
29 liability may apply. (NRS 41.141) Section 3 of this bill: (1) removes the
30 requirement for comparative negligence to be asserted as a defense; (2) removes the
31 limitation prohibiting the comparative negligence of the defendant and the amount
32 of the settlement from being admitted into evidence or considered by a jury; (3)
33 requires a trier of fact to consider the fault of all persons who contributed to the
34 death, injury or damage to the property; (4) authorizes a trier of fact to consider the
35 negligence, strict liability or fault of a nonparty under certain circumstances; (5)
36 provides various limitations on the use of percentages of fault for nonparties; and
37 (6) repeals the provisions providing for joint and several liability in certain
38 circumstances.
39 A common law doctrine, known as the “collateral source rule,” prohibits a
40 defendant in a tort case, which generally includes actions for personal injury, from
41 introducing into evidence proof of amounts that the plaintiff received or was
42 entitled to receive from a source other than the defendant in compensation for the
43 harms or injuries caused by the defendant. Existing law provides a limited
44 exception to the collateral source rule by allowing a defendant in a case against a
45 provider of health care based upon professional negligence to introduce evidence of
46 amounts paid or payable to a plaintiff pursuant to policies of health or accident
47 insurance, the United States Social Security Act, worker’s compensation statutes
48 and other programs or contracts that pay for or reimburse costs of health care.
49 (NRS 42.021)
50 Section 4 of this bill abolishes the common law collateral source rule in civil
51 actions for personal injury, other than those actions against a provider of health care
52 based upon professional negligence, and instead limits the amount of damages for
53 medical expenses to the amount that the plaintiff has been or will be compensated
54 for his or her injury by health insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.
55 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act, which provides
56 for the payment of compensation to employees who are injured or disabled as a
57 result of an occupational injury or disease. (Chapters 616A-616D of NRS) Sections
58 5-9 of this bill revise various provisions of the Act to prohibit a private attorney or
59 representative of a claimant or injured employee, as applicable, from receiving a
60 fee for any services provided in an amount greater than 20 percent of any lump sum
61 payment paid to the claimant or injured employee.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.03475 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 41.03475 [Except as otherwise provided in NRS 41.745, no] A

8 Legislator which was outside the course and scope of the person’s
9 public duties or employment.
10 Sec. 2. NRS 41.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 41.130 [Except as otherwise provided in NRS 41.745,]
12 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever any person
13 shall suffer personal injury by wrongful act, neglect or default of
14 another, only the person causing the injury is liable to the person
15 injured for [damages; and where the person causing the injury is
16 employed by another person or corporation responsible for the
17 conduct of the person causing the injury, that other person or
18 corporation so responsible is liable to the person injured for]
19 damages.
20 Sec. 3. NRS 41.141 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 41.141 1. In any action to recover damages for death or
22 injury to persons or for injury to property , [in which comparative
23 negligence is asserted as a defense,] the comparative negligence of
24 the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s decedent does not bar a recovery if that
25 negligence was not greater than the negligence or gross negligence
26 of the parties to the action against whom recovery is sought.
27 2. In those cases, the judge shall instruct the jury that:
28 (a) The plaintiff may not recover if the plaintiff’s comparative
29 negligence or that of the plaintiff’s decedent is greater than the
30 negligence of the [defendant] tortfeasor or the combined negligence
31 of multiple [defendants.] tortfeasors.
32 (b) If the jury determines the plaintiff is entitled to recover, it
33 shall return:
34 (1) By general verdict the total amount of damages the
35 plaintiff would be entitled to recover without regard to the plaintiff’s
36 comparative negligence; and
37 (2) A special verdict indicating the percentage of negligence
38 attributable to each [party remaining in the action.] tortfeasor.
39 3. If a defendant in such an action settles with the plaintiff
40 before the entry of judgment, the [comparative negligence of that
41 defendant and the amount of the settlement must not thereafter be
42 admitted into evidence nor considered by the jury. The] judge shall
-
*SB363*
– 4 –
1 deduct the amount of the settlement from the net sum otherwise
2 recoverable by the plaintiff pursuant to the general and special
3 verdicts.
4 4. In assessing percentages of fault, the trier of fact shall
5 consider the fault of all persons who contributed to the death of,
6 or injury to, a person or injury to property, regardless of whether:
7 (a) The person was, or could have been, named a party to the
8 suit; and
9 (b) Liability is based upon strict liability or negligence.
10 5. The trier of fact may consider the negligence, strict liability
11 or fault of any nonparty if the plaintiff entered into a settlement
12 agreement with the nonparty or if the defending party gives notice
13 before trial, in accordance with any requirements established by
14 court rule, that a nonparty was wholly or partially at fault.
15 6. An assessment of percentage of fault for nonparties:
16 (a) May only be used for accurately determining the fault of
17 the named parties;
18 (b) Does not subject any nonparty to liability in the action
19 where the assessment is made; and
20 (c) May not be introduced as evidence of liability in any other
21 action.
22 7. Where recovery is allowed against more than one defendant
23 in such an action , [, except as otherwise provided in subsection 5,]
24 each defendant is severally liable to the plaintiff only for that
25 portion of the judgment which represents the percentage of
26 negligence attributable to that defendant.
27 [5. This section does not affect the joint and several liability, if
28 any, of the defendants in an action based upon:
29 (a) Strict liability;
30 (b) An intentional tort;
31 (c) The emission, disposal or spillage of a toxic or hazardous
32 substance;
33 (d) The concerted acts of the defendants; or
34 (e) An injury to any person or property resulting from a product
35 which is manufactured, distributed, sold or used in this State.

1 Sec. 5. NRS 616C.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 616C.380 1. If a hearing officer, appeals officer or district
3 court renders a decision on a claim for compensation and the insurer
4 or employer appeals that decision, but is unable to obtain a stay of
5 the decision:
6 (a) Payment of that portion of an award for a permanent partial
7 disability which is contested must be made in installment payments
8 until the claim reaches final resolution.
9 (b) Payment of the award must be made in monthly installments
10 of 66 2/3 percent of the average wage of the claimant until the claim
11 reaches final resolution if the claim is for more than 3 months of
12 past benefits for a temporary total disability or rehabilitation, or for
13 a payment in lump sum related to past benefits for rehabilitation,
14 such as costs for purchasing a business or equipment.
15 2. If the final resolution of the claim is in favor of the claimant,
16 the remaining amount of compensation to which the claimant is
17 entitled may be paid in a lump sum to the claimant if the claimant is
18 otherwise eligible for such a payment pursuant to NRS 616C.495
19 and any regulations adopted pursuant thereto. A private attorney or
20 representative of the claimant may not receive a fee for any
21 services provided in an amount greater than 20 percent of any
22 lump sum payment paid to the claimant pursuant to this section. If
23 the final resolution of the claim is in favor of the insurer or
24 employer, any amount paid to the claimant in excess of the
25 uncontested amount must be deducted from any future benefits
26 related to that claim, other than medical benefits, to which the
27 claimant is entitled. The deductions must be made in a reasonable
28 manner so as not to create an undue hardship to the claimant.
29 Sec. 6. NRS 616C.427 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 616C.427 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 3
31 of NRS 616C.315 and except as otherwise provided in this section,
32 if an injured employee is receiving compensation based on a
33 calculation of the average monthly wage of the injured employee as
34 determined pursuant to the regulations adopted by the Administrator
35 pursuant to NRS 616C.420, the injured employee or the employer
36 may request a hearing before a hearing officer pursuant to the
37 provisions of NRS 616C.315 to 616C.385, inclusive, asking for a
38 recalculation of the average monthly wage of the injured employee.
39 2. The injured employee is entitled to have his or her average
40 monthly wage recalculated if the injured employee proves by a
41 preponderance of the evidence that the insurer calculated the
42 average monthly wage improperly or incorrectly as a result of:
43 (a) The use of any improper or incorrect information or
44 methodology;
-
*SB363*
– 7 –
1 (b) The failure to use any proper or correct information or
2 methodology;
3 (c) Any error of law or fact; or
4 (d) Any other error, omission, neglect or wrongful act.
5 3. If the injured employee proves that the insurer calculated his
6 or her average monthly wage improperly or incorrectly, resulting in
7 an underpayment of compensation:
8 (a) The insurer shall:
9 (1) Increase the injured employee’s future compensation
10 based on the correct average monthly wage; and
11 (2) Pay the injured employee a lump sum in an amount equal
12 to the underpayment of compensation for the period during which
13 the insurer was using the incorrect average monthly wage; and
14 (b) The remedy provided in paragraph (a) is the sole remedy for
15 the underpayment and the insurer is not subject to the imposition of
16 any fine or benefit penalty therefor.
17 4. A private attorney or representative of the injured
18 employee may not receive a fee for any services provided in an
19 amount greater than 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to
20 the injured employee pursuant to this section.
21 5. If the hearing officer determines that the calculation of the
22 average monthly wage resulted in an overpayment of compensation,
23 the insurer may require the injured employee to repay to the insurer
24 an amount equal to the overpayment received by the injured
25 employee during any one 30-day period.
26 [5.] 6. The average monthly wage of an injured employee may
27 not be challenged by the insurer, the employer or the injured
28 employee after the date on which any portion of an award for
29 permanent partial disability is paid or the claim closes, whichever
30 occurs first.
31 [6.] 7. The provisions of this section do not apply if the issue
32 of the average monthly wage of the injured employee was
33 previously adjudicated to a final decision in:
34 (a) A hearing before a hearing officer or appeals officer pursuant
35 to the provisions of NRS 616C.315 to 616C.385, inclusive; or
36 (b) Any proceedings for judicial review.
37 Sec. 7. NRS 616C.495 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 616C.495 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.380,
39 an award for a permanent partial disability may be paid to a
40 claimant in a lump sum under the following conditions:
41 (a) A claimant injured on or after July 1, 1973, and before
42 July 1, 1981, who incurs a disability that does not exceed 12 percent
43 may elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum. A
44 claimant injured on or after July 1, 1981, and before July 1, 1995,
-
*SB363*
– 8 –
1 who incurs a disability that does not exceed 30 percent may elect to
2 receive his or her compensation in a lump sum.
3 (b) The spouse, or in the absence of a spouse, any dependent
4 child of a deceased claimant injured on or after July 1, 1973, who is
5 not entitled to compensation in accordance with NRS 616C.505, is
6 entitled to a lump sum equal to the present value of the deceased
7 claimant’s undisbursed award for a permanent partial disability.
8 (c) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 1981, and before
9 July 1, 1995, who incurs a disability that exceeds 30 percent may
10 elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum equal to the
11 present value of an award for a disability of 30 percent. If the
12 claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to this paragraph,
13 the insurer shall pay in installments to the claimant that portion of
14 the claimant’s disability in excess of 30 percent.
15 (d) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 1995, and before
16 January 1, 2016, who incurs a disability that:
17 (1) Does not exceed 25 percent may elect to receive his or
18 her compensation in a lump sum.
19 (2) Exceeds 25 percent may:
20 (I) Elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum
21 equal to the present value of an award for a disability of 25 percent.
22 If the claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to this sub-
23 subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in installments to the claimant
24 that portion of the claimant’s disability in excess of 25 percent.
25 (II) To the extent that the insurer has offered to provide
26 compensation in a lump sum up to the present value of an award for
27 disability of 30 percent, elect to receive his or her compensation in a
28 lump sum up to the present value of an award for a disability of 30
29 percent. If the claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to
30 this sub-subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in installments to the
31 claimant that portion of the claimant’s disability in excess of 30
32 percent.
33 (e) Any claimant injured on or after January 1, 2016, and before
34 July 1, 2017, who incurs a disability that:
35 (1) Does not exceed 30 percent may elect to receive his or
36 her compensation in a lump sum.
37 (2) Exceeds 30 percent may elect to receive his or her
38 compensation in a lump sum equal to the present value of an award
39 for a disability of 30 percent. If the claimant elects to receive
40 compensation pursuant to this subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in
41 installments to the claimant that portion of the claimant’s disability
42 in excess of 30 percent.
43 (f) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 2017, who incurs a
44 disability that:
-
*SB363*
– 9 –
1 (1) Does not exceed 30 percent may elect to receive his or
2 her compensation in a lump sum.
3 (2) Exceeds 30 percent may elect to receive his or her
4 compensation in a lump sum equal to the present value of an award
5 for a disability of up to 30 percent. If the claimant elects to receive
6 compensation pursuant to this subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in
7 installments to the claimant that portion of the claimant’s disability
8 in excess of 30 percent.
9 (g) If the permanent partial disability rating of a claimant
10 seeking compensation pursuant to this section would, when
11 combined with any previous permanent partial disability rating of
12 the claimant that resulted in an award of benefits to the claimant,
13 result in the claimant having a total permanent partial disability
14 rating in excess of 100 percent, the claimant’s disability rating upon
15 which compensation is calculated must be reduced by such
16 percentage as required to limit the total permanent partial disability
17 rating of the claimant for all injuries to not more than 100 percent.
18 2. If the claimant elects to receive his or her payment for a
19 permanent partial disability in a lump sum pursuant to subsection 1,
20 all of the claimant’s benefits for compensation terminate. Except as
21 otherwise provided in paragraph (d), the claimant’s acceptance of
22 that payment constitutes a final settlement of all factual and legal
23 issues in the case. By so accepting the claimant waives all of his or
24 her rights regarding the claim, including the right to appeal from the
25 closure of the case or the percentage of his or her disability, except:
26 (a) The right of the claimant to:
27 (1) Reopen his or her claim in accordance with the
28 provisions of NRS 616C.390; or
29 (2) Have his or her claim considered by his or her insurer
30 pursuant to NRS 616C.392;
31 (b) Any counseling, training or other rehabilitative services
32 provided by the insurer;
33 (c) The right of the claimant to receive a benefit penalty in
34 accordance with NRS 616D.120; and
35 (d) The right of the claimant to conclude or resolve any
36 contested matter which is pending at the time that the claimant
37 executes his or her election to receive his or her payment for a
38 permanent partial disability in a lump sum. The provisions of this
39 paragraph do not apply to:
40 (1) The scope of the claim;
41 (2) The claimant’s stable and ratable status; and
42 (3) The claimant’s average monthly wage.
43 3. The claimant, when he or she demands payment in a lump
44 sum pursuant to subsection 2, must be provided with a written
45 notice which prominently displays a statement describing the effects
-
*SB363*
– 10 –
1 of accepting payment in a lump sum of an entire permanent partial
2 disability award, any portion of such an award or any uncontested
3 portion of such an award, and that the claimant has 20 days after the
4 mailing or personal delivery of the notice within which to retract or
5 reaffirm the demand, before payment may be made and the
6 claimant’s election becomes final.
7 4. Any lump-sum payment which has been paid on a claim
8 incurred on or after July 1, 1973, must be supplemented if necessary
9 to conform to the provisions of this section.
10 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the total
11 lump-sum payment for disablement paid to the claimant must not
12 be less than one-half the product of the average monthly wage
13 multiplied by the percentage of disability. If the claimant received
14 compensation in installment payments for his or her permanent
15 partial disability before electing to receive payment for that
16 disability in a lump sum, the lump-sum payment must be calculated
17 for the remaining payment of compensation.
18 6. The lump sum payable to the claimant must be equal to the
19 present value of the compensation awarded, less any advance
20 payment or lump sum previously paid. The present value must be
21 calculated using monthly payments in the amounts prescribed in
22 subsection 8 of NRS 616C.490 and actuarial annuity tables adopted
23 by the Division. The tables must be reviewed annually by a
24 consulting actuary and must be adjusted accordingly on July 1 of
25 each year by the Division using:
26 (a) The most recent unisex “Static Mortality Tables for Defined
27 Benefit Pension Plans” published by the Internal Revenue Service;
28 and
29 (b) The average 30-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for
30 March of the current year as reported by the Board of Governors of
31 the Federal Reserve System.
32 7. To calculate the present value of a lump sum payable to a
33 claimant, the insurer shall use the actuarial annuity tables adopted
34 by the Division that are in effect on the date on which the claimant
35 elects payment in a lump sum.
36 8. If a claimant would receive more money by electing to
37 receive compensation in a lump sum than the claimant would if he
38 or she receives installment payments, the claimant may elect to
39 receive the lump-sum payment.
40 9. A private attorney or representative of the claimant may
41 not receive a fee for any services provided in an amount greater
42 than 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to the claimant
43 pursuant to this section.

26 4. A private attorney or representative of an injured employee
27 may not receive a fee for any services in an amount greater than
28 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to the injured employee
29 pursuant to this section.
30 5. An injured employee who resides outside of this State but
31 does not qualify to receive vocational rehabilitation services outside
32 of this State pursuant to subsection 2 may receive the vocational
33 rehabilitation services to which the injured employee is entitled
34 pursuant to NRS 616C.545 to 616C.575, inclusive, and 616C.590 if
35 the injured employee relocates to:
36 (a) This State; or
37 (b) A location within 50 miles from any border of this State,
38  at his or her own expense, if such services are available at such a
39 location.
40 [5.] 6. An injured employee who resides in this State may
41 receive vocational rehabilitation services outside of this State at a
42 location within 50 miles from the residence of the injured employee
43 if such services are available at such a location. An insurer may not
44 unreasonably deny a request made by an injured employee pursuant
-
*SB363*
– 12 –
1 to this subsection to receive vocational rehabilitation services
2 outside of this State.
3 [6.] 7. An injured employee may receive vocational
4 rehabilitation services in any state that borders this State if the
5 injured employee demonstrates that the services are available in a
6 more cost-effective manner than are available in this State. Any
7 vocational rehabilitation services provided pursuant to this
8 subsection must be monitored by a vocational rehabilitation
9 counselor in this State.
10 Sec. 9. NRS 616C.595 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 616C.595 1. If an injured employee is eligible for vocational
12 rehabilitation services pursuant to NRS 616C.590, the insurer and
13 the injured employee may, at any time during the employee’s
14 eligibility for such services, execute a written agreement providing
15 for the payment of compensation to the injured employee in a lump
16 sum in lieu of the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. An
17 insurer’s refusal to execute such an agreement may not be appealed.
18 2. If the insurer and the injured employee execute an agreement
19 pursuant to subsection 1, the acceptance of the payment of
20 compensation in a lump sum by the injured employee extinguishes
21 the right of the injured employee to receive vocational rehabilitation
22 services under the injured employee’s claim. Except as otherwise
23 required by federal law, an injured employee shall not receive
24 vocational rehabilitation services from any state agency after the
25 injured employee accepts payment of compensation in a lump sum
26 pursuant to this section.
27 3. Before executing an agreement pursuant to subsection 1, an
28 insurer shall:
29 (a) Order an assessment of and counseling concerning the
30 vocational skills of the injured employee, unless the provisions of
31 subsection 3 of NRS 616C.580 are applicable;
32 (b) Consult with the employer of the injured employee; and
33 (c) Provide a written notice to the injured employee that
34 contains the following statements:
35 (1) That the injured employee is urged to seek assistance and
36 advice from the Nevada Attorney for Injured Workers or to consult
37 with a private attorney before signing the agreement.
38 (2) That the injured employee may rescind the agreement
39 within 20 days after the injured employee signs it.
40 (3) That the 20-day period pursuant to subparagraph (2) may
41 not be waived.
42 (4) That acceptance by the injured employee of payment of
43 compensation in a lump sum in lieu of the provision of vocational
44 rehabilitation services extinguishes the right of the injured employee
45 to receive such services.
-
*SB363*
– 13 –
1 4. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.580, any
2 payment of compensation in a lump sum in lieu of the provision of
3 vocational rehabilitation services must not be less than 55 percent of
4 the maximum amount of vocational rehabilitation maintenance due
5 to the injured employee pursuant to NRS 616C.555.
6 5. No payment of compensation in a lump sum may be made
7 pursuant to this section until the 20-day period provided for the
8 rescission of the agreement has expired.
9 6. A private attorney or representative of the injured
10 employee may not receive a fee for any services in an amount
11 greater than 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to the
12 injured employee pursuant to this section.
13 Sec. 10. NRS 41.745 is hereby repealed.

S.B. 363
SENATE BILL NO. 363–SENATOR HANSEN
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing civil actions.
(BDR 3-1017)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; removing and repealing
provisions relating to vicarious liability; revising
provisions governing comparative negligence; requiring a
trier of fact to consider the fault of all persons, including
persons not named as a party, in an action to recover
damages for death or injury to persons or for injury to
property; authorizing the admission of certain evidence in
certain civil actions; limiting the amount of medical
expenses recoverable as damages in certain civil actions;
limiting the amount of fees that a private attorney or
representative may receive in proceedings under the
Nevada Industrial Insurance Act; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 A common law doctrine, known as “vicarious liability,” generally provides that
2 a principal party is responsible for the actions of the agent of the principal. Existing
3 law provides: (1) whenever any person suffers personal injury by wrongful act,
4 neglect or default of another, the person causing the injury is liable to the person
5 injured for damages; and (2) with certain exceptions, where the person causing the
6 injury is employed by another person or corporation responsible for the conduct of
7 the person causing the injury, the other person or corporation is liable to the person
8 injured for damages. (NRS 41.130) Section 2 of this bill instead provides that only
9 the person causing the injury is liable to the person injured and removes the
10 provisions of existing law providing for liability on the employer for the actions of
11 the person who caused the injury. Section 10 of this bill repeals the existing
12 provisions of law which set forth certain limitations on the liability of the employer,
13 and section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a reference to the
14 provisions repealed by section 10.
-
*SB363*

– 2 –
15 Existing law provides that in any action to recover damages for death or injury
16 to persons or property where comparative negligence is asserted as a defense, the
17 comparative negligence of the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s decedent does not bar
18 recovery if that negligence was not greater than the negligence or gross negligence
19 of the parties against whom recovery is sought. If the jury determines that the
20 plaintiff is entitled to recover in such a case, existing law requires the jury to return:
21 (1) a general verdict with the total amount of damages the plaintiff would be
22 entitled to recover notwithstanding the plaintiff’s comparative negligence; and (2) a
23 special verdict indicating the percentage of negligence assigned to each party
24 remaining in the action. Existing law further requires that, in an action where a
25 plaintiff may recover from more than one defendant, each defendant is severally
26 liable to the plaintiff only for that portion of the judgment representing the
27 percentage of negligence assigned to that defendant. Existing law also contains
28 exceptions for certain causes of action where the doctrine of joint and several
29 liability may apply. (NRS 41.141) Section 3 of this bill: (1) removes the
30 requirement for comparative negligence to be asserted as a defense; (2) removes the
31 limitation prohibiting the comparative negligence of the defendant and the amount
32 of the settlement from being admitted into evidence or considered by a jury; (3)
33 requires a trier of fact to consider the fault of all persons who contributed to the
34 death, injury or damage to the property; (4) authorizes a trier of fact to consider the
35 negligence, strict liability or fault of a nonparty under certain circumstances; (5)
36 provides various limitations on the use of percentages of fault for nonparties; and
37 (6) repeals the provisions providing for joint and several liability in certain
38 circumstances.
39 A common law doctrine, known as the “collateral source rule,” prohibits a
40 defendant in a tort case, which generally includes actions for personal injury, from
41 introducing into evidence proof of amounts that the plaintiff received or was
42 entitled to receive from a source other than the defendant in compensation for the
43 harms or injuries caused by the defendant. Existing law provides a limited
44 exception to the collateral source rule by allowing a defendant in a case against a
45 provider of health care based upon professional negligence to introduce evidence of
46 amounts paid or payable to a plaintiff pursuant to policies of health or accident
47 insurance, the United States Social Security Act, worker’s compensation statutes
48 and other programs or contracts that pay for or reimburse costs of health care.
49 (NRS 42.021)
50 Section 4 of this bill abolishes the common law collateral source rule in civil
51 actions for personal injury, other than those actions against a provider of health care
52 based upon professional negligence, and instead limits the amount of damages for
53 medical expenses to the amount that the plaintiff has been or will be compensated
54 for his or her injury by health insurance, Medicare or Medicaid.
55 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act, which provides
56 for the payment of compensation to employees who are injured or disabled as a
57 result of an occupational injury or disease. (Chapters 616A-616D of NRS) Sections
58 5-9 of this bill revise various provisions of the Act to prohibit a private attorney or
59 representative of a claimant or injured employee, as applicable, from receiving a
60 fee for any services provided in an amount greater than 20 percent of any lump sum
61 payment paid to the claimant or injured employee.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.03475 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 41.03475 [Except as otherwise provided in NRS 41.745, no] A
4 judgment may not be entered against the State of Nevada or any
5 agency of the State or against any political subdivision of the State
6 for any act or omission of any present or former officer, employee,
7 immune contractor, member of a board or commission or State
8 Legislator which was outside the course and scope of the person’s
9 public duties or employment.
10 Sec. 2. NRS 41.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 41.130 [Except as otherwise provided in NRS 41.745,]
12 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever any person
13 shall suffer personal injury by wrongful act, neglect or default of
14 another, only the person causing the injury is liable to the person
15 injured for [damages; and where the person causing the injury is
16 employed by another person or corporation responsible for the
17 conduct of the person causing the injury, that other person or
18 corporation so responsible is liable to the person injured for]
19 damages.
20 Sec. 3. NRS 41.141 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 41.141 1. In any action to recover damages for death or
22 injury to persons or for injury to property , [in which comparative
23 negligence is asserted as a defense,] the comparative negligence of
24 the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s decedent does not bar a recovery if that
25 negligence was not greater than the negligence or gross negligence
26 of the parties to the action against whom recovery is sought.
27 2. In those cases, the judge shall instruct the jury that:
28 (a) The plaintiff may not recover if the plaintiff’s comparative
29 negligence or that of the plaintiff’s decedent is greater than the
30 negligence of the [defendant] tortfeasor or the combined negligence
31 of multiple [defendants.] tortfeasors.
32 (b) If the jury determines the plaintiff is entitled to recover, it
33 shall return:
34 (1) By general verdict the total amount of damages the
35 plaintiff would be entitled to recover without regard to the plaintiff’s
36 comparative negligence; and
37 (2) A special verdict indicating the percentage of negligence
38 attributable to each [party remaining in the action.] tortfeasor.
39 3. If a defendant in such an action settles with the plaintiff
40 before the entry of judgment, the [comparative negligence of that
41 defendant and the amount of the settlement must not thereafter be
42 admitted into evidence nor considered by the jury. The] judge shall
-
*SB363*

– 4 –
1 deduct the amount of the settlement from the net sum otherwise
2 recoverable by the plaintiff pursuant to the general and special
3 verdicts.
4 4. In assessing percentages of fault, the trier of fact shall
5 consider the fault of all persons who contributed to the death of,
6 or injury to, a person or injury to property, regardless of whether:
7 (a) The person was, or could have been, named a party to the
8 suit; and
9 (b) Liability is based upon strict liability or negligence.
10 5. The trier of fact may consider the negligence, strict liability
11 or fault of any nonparty if the plaintiff entered into a settlement
12 agreement with the nonparty or if the defending party gives notice
13 before trial, in accordance with any requirements established by
14 court rule, that a nonparty was wholly or partially at fault.
15 6. An assessment of percentage of fault for nonparties:
16 (a) May only be used for accurately determining the fault of
17 the named parties;
18 (b) Does not subject any nonparty to liability in the action
19 where the assessment is made; and
20 (c) May not be introduced as evidence of liability in any other
21 action.
22 7. Where recovery is allowed against more than one defendant
23 in such an action , [, except as otherwise provided in subsection 5,]
24 each defendant is severally liable to the plaintiff only for that
25 portion of the judgment which represents the percentage of
26 negligence attributable to that defendant.
27 [5. This section does not affect the joint and several liability, if
28 any, of the defendants in an action based upon:
29 (a) Strict liability;
30 (b) An intentional tort;
31 (c) The emission, disposal or spillage of a toxic or hazardous
32 substance;
33 (d) The concerted acts of the defendants; or
34 (e) An injury to any person or property resulting from a product
35 which is manufactured, distributed, sold or used in this State.
36 6. As used in this section:
37 (a) “Concerted acts of the defendants” does not include
38 negligent acts committed by providers of health care while working
39 together to provide treatment to a patient.
40 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in
41 NRS 629.031.]
42 Sec. 4. Chapter 42 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
43 thereto a new section to read as follows:
44 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 42.021, in any civil action
45 for personal injury caused by wrongful act, neglect or default of

2 the trier of fact as follows:
3 1. Damages for past medical expenses that have been paid
4 must not exceed the amount paid, regardless of the source of
5 payment.
6 2. Damages for past medical expenses that are unpaid must
7 not exceed:
8 (a) If the plaintiff has health insurance:
9 (1) The amount that the health insurance is obligated to
10 pay to satisfy the charges for the medical treatment; and
11 (2) The share of medical expenses that the plaintiff is
12 required to pay under the health insurance policy.
13 (b) If the plaintiff has health insurance but obtains medical

23 percent of:
24 (1) The Medicare reimbursement rate in effect on the date

26 (2) The applicable Medicaid reimbursement rate in effect
27 on the date of the medical treatment received by the plaintiff, if
28 there is not an applicable Medicare reimbursement rate for the
29 treatment.
30 3. Damages for any future medical expenses that the plaintiff
31 will incur must not exceed, if at the time of trial the plaintiff:
32 (a) Has health insurance or is eligible for health insurance:
33 (1) The amount for which the future medical expenses
34 could be satisfied if submitted to the health insurance; and
35 (2) The share of medical expenses under the health
36 insurance policy that the plaintiff would be entitled.

1 Sec. 5. NRS 616C.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 616C.380 1. If a hearing officer, appeals officer or district
3 court renders a decision on a claim for compensation and the insurer
4 or employer appeals that decision, but is unable to obtain a stay of
5 the decision:
6 (a) Payment of that portion of an award for a permanent partial
7 disability which is contested must be made in installment payments
8 until the claim reaches final resolution.
9 (b) Payment of the award must be made in monthly installments
10 of 66 2/3 percent of the average wage of the claimant until the claim
11 reaches final resolution if the claim is for more than 3 months of
12 past benefits for a temporary total disability or rehabilitation, or for
13 a payment in lump sum related to past benefits for rehabilitation,
14 such as costs for purchasing a business or equipment.
15 2. If the final resolution of the claim is in favor of the claimant,
16 the remaining amount of compensation to which the claimant is
17 entitled may be paid in a lump sum to the claimant if the claimant is
18 otherwise eligible for such a payment pursuant to NRS 616C.495
19 and any regulations adopted pursuant thereto. A private attorney or
20 representative of the claimant may not receive a fee for any
21 services provided in an amount greater than 20 percent of any
22 lump sum payment paid to the claimant pursuant to this section. If
23 the final resolution of the claim is in favor of the insurer or
24 employer, any amount paid to the claimant in excess of the
25 uncontested amount must be deducted from any future benefits
26 related to that claim, other than medical benefits, to which the
27 claimant is entitled. The deductions must be made in a reasonable
28 manner so as not to create an undue hardship to the claimant.
29 Sec. 6. NRS 616C.427 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 616C.427 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 3
31 of NRS 616C.315 and except as otherwise provided in this section,
32 if an injured employee is receiving compensation based on a
33 calculation of the average monthly wage of the injured employee as
34 determined pursuant to the regulations adopted by the Administrator
35 pursuant to NRS 616C.420, the injured employee or the employer
36 may request a hearing before a hearing officer pursuant to the
37 provisions of NRS 616C.315 to 616C.385, inclusive, asking for a
38 recalculation of the average monthly wage of the injured employee.
39 2. The injured employee is entitled to have his or her average
40 monthly wage recalculated if the injured employee proves by a
41 preponderance of the evidence that the insurer calculated the
42 average monthly wage improperly or incorrectly as a result of:
43 (a) The use of any improper or incorrect information or
44 methodology;
-
*SB363*

– 7 –
1 (b) The failure to use any proper or correct information or
2 methodology;
3 (c) Any error of law or fact; or
4 (d) Any other error, omission, neglect or wrongful act.
5 3. If the injured employee proves that the insurer calculated his
6 or her average monthly wage improperly or incorrectly, resulting in
7 an underpayment of compensation:
8 (a) The insurer shall:
9 (1) Increase the injured employee’s future compensation
10 based on the correct average monthly wage; and
11 (2) Pay the injured employee a lump sum in an amount equal
12 to the underpayment of compensation for the period during which
13 the insurer was using the incorrect average monthly wage; and
14 (b) The remedy provided in paragraph (a) is the sole remedy for
15 the underpayment and the insurer is not subject to the imposition of
16 any fine or benefit penalty therefor.
17 4. A private attorney or representative of the injured
18 employee may not receive a fee for any services provided in an
19 amount greater than 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to
20 the injured employee pursuant to this section.
21 5. If the hearing officer determines that the calculation of the
22 average monthly wage resulted in an overpayment of compensation,
23 the insurer may require the injured employee to repay to the insurer
24 an amount equal to the overpayment received by the injured
25 employee during any one 30-day period.
26 [5.] 6. The average monthly wage of an injured employee may
27 not be challenged by the insurer, the employer or the injured
28 employee after the date on which any portion of an award for
29 permanent partial disability is paid or the claim closes, whichever
30 occurs first.
31 [6.] 7. The provisions of this section do not apply if the issue
32 of the average monthly wage of the injured employee was
33 previously adjudicated to a final decision in:
34 (a) A hearing before a hearing officer or appeals officer pursuant
35 to the provisions of NRS 616C.315 to 616C.385, inclusive; or
36 (b) Any proceedings for judicial review.
37 Sec. 7. NRS 616C.495 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 616C.495 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.380,
39 an award for a permanent partial disability may be paid to a
40 claimant in a lump sum under the following conditions:
41 (a) A claimant injured on or after July 1, 1973, and before
42 July 1, 1981, who incurs a disability that does not exceed 12 percent
43 may elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum. A
44 claimant injured on or after July 1, 1981, and before July 1, 1995,
-
*SB363*

– 8 –
1 who incurs a disability that does not exceed 30 percent may elect to
2 receive his or her compensation in a lump sum.
3 (b) The spouse, or in the absence of a spouse, any dependent
4 child of a deceased claimant injured on or after July 1, 1973, who is
5 not entitled to compensation in accordance with NRS 616C.505, is
6 entitled to a lump sum equal to the present value of the deceased
7 claimant’s undisbursed award for a permanent partial disability.
8 (c) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 1981, and before
9 July 1, 1995, who incurs a disability that exceeds 30 percent may
10 elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum equal to the
11 present value of an award for a disability of 30 percent. If the
12 claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to this paragraph,
13 the insurer shall pay in installments to the claimant that portion of
14 the claimant’s disability in excess of 30 percent.
15 (d) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 1995, and before
16 January 1, 2016, who incurs a disability that:
17 (1) Does not exceed 25 percent may elect to receive his or
18 her compensation in a lump sum.
19 (2) Exceeds 25 percent may:
20 (I) Elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum
21 equal to the present value of an award for a disability of 25 percent.
22 If the claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to this sub-
23 subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in installments to the claimant
24 that portion of the claimant’s disability in excess of 25 percent.
25 (II) To the extent that the insurer has offered to provide
26 compensation in a lump sum up to the present value of an award for
27 disability of 30 percent, elect to receive his or her compensation in a
28 lump sum up to the present value of an award for a disability of 30
29 percent. If the claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to
30 this sub-subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in installments to the
31 claimant that portion of the claimant’s disability in excess of 30
32 percent.
33 (e) Any claimant injured on or after January 1, 2016, and before
34 July 1, 2017, who incurs a disability that:
35 (1) Does not exceed 30 percent may elect to receive his or
36 her compensation in a lump sum.
37 (2) Exceeds 30 percent may elect to receive his or her
38 compensation in a lump sum equal to the present value of an award
39 for a disability of 30 percent. If the claimant elects to receive
40 compensation pursuant to this subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in
41 installments to the claimant that portion of the claimant’s disability
42 in excess of 30 percent.
43 (f) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 2017, who incurs a
44 disability that:
-
*SB363*

– 9 –
1 (1) Does not exceed 30 percent may elect to receive his or
2 her compensation in a lump sum.
3 (2) Exceeds 30 percent may elect to receive his or her
4 compensation in a lump sum equal to the present value of an award
5 for a disability of up to 30 percent. If the claimant elects to receive
6 compensation pursuant to this subparagraph, the insurer shall pay in
7 installments to the claimant that portion of the claimant’s disability
8 in excess of 30 percent.
9 (g) If the permanent partial disability rating of a claimant
10 seeking compensation pursuant to this section would, when
11 combined with any previous permanent partial disability rating of
12 the claimant that resulted in an award of benefits to the claimant,
13 result in the claimant having a total permanent partial disability
14 rating in excess of 100 percent, the claimant’s disability rating upon
15 which compensation is calculated must be reduced by such
16 percentage as required to limit the total permanent partial disability
17 rating of the claimant for all injuries to not more than 100 percent.
18 2. If the claimant elects to receive his or her payment for a
19 permanent partial disability in a lump sum pursuant to subsection 1,
20 all of the claimant’s benefits for compensation terminate. Except as
21 otherwise provided in paragraph (d), the claimant’s acceptance of
22 that payment constitutes a final settlement of all factual and legal
23 issues in the case. By so accepting the claimant waives all of his or
24 her rights regarding the claim, including the right to appeal from the
25 closure of the case or the percentage of his or her disability, except:
26 (a) The right of the claimant to:
27 (1) Reopen his or her claim in accordance with the
28 provisions of NRS 616C.390; or
29 (2) Have his or her claim considered by his or her insurer
30 pursuant to NRS 616C.392;
31 (b) Any counseling, training or other rehabilitative services
32 provided by the insurer;
33 (c) The right of the claimant to receive a benefit penalty in
34 accordance with NRS 616D.120; and
35 (d) The right of the claimant to conclude or resolve any
36 contested matter which is pending at the time that the claimant
37 executes his or her election to receive his or her payment for a
38 permanent partial disability in a lump sum. The provisions of this
39 paragraph do not apply to:
40 (1) The scope of the claim;
41 (2) The claimant’s stable and ratable status; and
42 (3) The claimant’s average monthly wage.
43 3. The claimant, when he or she demands payment in a lump
44 sum pursuant to subsection 2, must be provided with a written
45 notice which prominently displays a statement describing the effects
-
*SB363*

– 10 –
1 of accepting payment in a lump sum of an entire permanent partial
2 disability award, any portion of such an award or any uncontested
3 portion of such an award, and that the claimant has 20 days after the
4 mailing or personal delivery of the notice within which to retract or
5 reaffirm the demand, before payment may be made and the
6 claimant’s election becomes final.
7 4. Any lump-sum payment which has been paid on a claim
8 incurred on or after July 1, 1973, must be supplemented if necessary
9 to conform to the provisions of this section.
10 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the total
11 lump-sum payment for disablement paid to the claimant must not
12 be less than one-half the product of the average monthly wage
13 multiplied by the percentage of disability. If the claimant received
14 compensation in installment payments for his or her permanent
15 partial disability before electing to receive payment for that
16 disability in a lump sum, the lump-sum payment must be calculated
17 for the remaining payment of compensation.
18 6. The lump sum payable to the claimant must be equal to the
19 present value of the compensation awarded, less any advance
20 payment or lump sum previously paid. The present value must be
21 calculated using monthly payments in the amounts prescribed in
22 subsection 8 of NRS 616C.490 and actuarial annuity tables adopted
23 by the Division. The tables must be reviewed annually by a
24 consulting actuary and must be adjusted accordingly on July 1 of
25 each year by the Division using:
26 (a) The most recent unisex “Static Mortality Tables for Defined
27 Benefit Pension Plans” published by the Internal Revenue Service;
28 and
29 (b) The average 30-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for
30 March of the current year as reported by the Board of Governors of
31 the Federal Reserve System.
32 7. To calculate the present value of a lump sum payable to a
33 claimant, the insurer shall use the actuarial annuity tables adopted
34 by the Division that are in effect on the date on which the claimant
35 elects payment in a lump sum.
36 8. If a claimant would receive more money by electing to
37 receive compensation in a lump sum than the claimant would if he
38 or she receives installment payments, the claimant may elect to
39 receive the lump-sum payment.
40 9. A private attorney or representative of the claimant may
41 not receive a fee for any services provided in an amount greater
42 than 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to the claimant
43 pursuant to this section.

7 border of this State, on the date of injury; or
8 (b) Was injured while temporarily employed in this State by an
9 employer subject to the provisions of chapters 616A to 617,
10 inclusive, of NRS who can demonstrate that, on the date of injury,

12  may receive vocational rehabilitation services at a location within
13 50 miles from his or her residence if such services are available at
14 such a location.
15 3. An injured employee who:
16 (a) Is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to
17 NRS 616C.590; and
18 (b) Resides outside of this State but does not qualify to receive
19 vocational rehabilitation services outside of this State pursuant to
20 subsection 2,
21  may execute a written agreement with the insurer which provides
22 for the payment of compensation to the injured employee in a lump
23 sum in lieu of the provision of vocational rehabilitation services
24 pursuant to NRS 616C.595. The amount of the lump sum must not
25 exceed $20,000.
26 4. A private attorney or representative of an injured employee
27 may not receive a fee for any services in an amount greater than
28 20 percent of any lump sum payment paid to the injured employee
29 pursuant to this section.
30 5. An injured employee who resides outside of this State but
31 does not qualify to receive vocational rehabilitation services outside
32 of this State pursuant to subsection 2 may receive the vocational
33 rehabilitation services to which the injured employee is entitled
34 pursuant to NRS 616C.545 to 616C.575, inclusive, and 616C.590 if
35 the injured employee relocates to:
36 (a) This State; or
37 (b) A location within 50 miles from any border of this State,
38  at his or her own expense, if such services are available at such a

40 [5.] 6. An injured employee who resides in this State may
41 receive vocational rehabilitation services outside of this State at a
42 location within 50 miles from the residence of the injured employee
43 if such services are available at such a location. An insurer may not
44 unreasonably deny a request made by an injured employee pursuant
-
*SB363*

– 12 –
1 to this subsection to receive vocational rehabilitation services
2 outside of this State.
3 [6.] 7. An injured employee may receive vocational
4 rehabilitation services in any state that borders this State if the
5 injured employee demonstrates that the services are available in a
6 more cost-effective manner than are available in this State. Any
7 vocational rehabilitation services provided pursuant to this
8 subsection must be monitored by a vocational rehabilitation
9 counselor in this State.
10 Sec. 9. NRS 616C.595 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 616C.595 1. If an injured employee is eligible for vocational

13 the injured employee may, at any time during the employee’s
14 eligibility for such services, execute a written agreement providing
15 for the payment of compensation to the injured employee in a lump
16 sum in lieu of the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. An
17 insurer’s refusal to execute such an agreement may not be appealed.
18 2. If the insurer and the injured employee execute an agreement
19 pursuant to subsection 1, the acceptance of the payment of
20 compensation in a lump sum by the injured employee extinguishes
21 the right of the injured employee to receive vocational rehabilitation
22 services under the injured employee’s claim. Except as otherwise
23 required by federal law, an injured employee shall not receive
24 vocational rehabilitation services from any state agency after the
25 injured employee accepts payment of compensation in a lump sum
26 pursuant to this section.
27 3. Before executing an agreement pursuant to subsection 1, an
28 insurer shall:

34 contains the following statements:
35 (1) That the injured employee is urged to seek assistance and
36 advice from the Nevada Attorney for Injured Workers or to consult

38 (2) That the injured employee may rescind the agreement
39 within 20 days after the injured employee signs it.
40 (3) That the 20-day period pursuant to subparagraph (2) may
41 not be waived.

– 13 –
1 4. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.580, any
2 payment of compensation in a lump sum in lieu of the provision of
3 vocational rehabilitation services must not be less than 55 percent of
4 the maximum amount of vocational rehabilitation maintenance due
