Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Attorney General to publish model policies for limiting, to the
2 fullest extent possible and consistent with any applicable law, immigration enforcement at
3 certain public places, including public schools. (NRS 228.208) Section 1 of this bill prohibits
4 a school district, public school or any employee of a school district or public school, except
5 pursuant to a lawful court order or warrant, from providing a United States Immigration and
6 Customs Enforcement officer, or other federal official engaging in the investigation or
7 enforcement of immigration laws: (1) permission to access the grounds, buildings or facilities
8 of a school district or public school; or (2) the education records of or information about a
9 pupil or the family or household of a pupil. Section 1 additionally applies the prohibition on
10 the provision of the education records of or information about a pupil or the family or
11 household of a pupil to a state or local law enforcement officer engaged in the investigation or
12 enforcement of immigration laws. Section 1 [makes] provides that a violation of this
13 prohibition : (1) for the first violation, subjects the person who violated the provision to
14 disciplinary action by the school district or public school that employs the person; and
15 (2) for each subsequent violation, is punishable as a misdemeanor.

Assembly Amendment No. 159 to Assembly Bill No. 217 Page 4
16 [Existing law authorizes: (1) the board of trustees of a school district to employ, appoint
17 or contract for the provision of school police officers; and (2) the governing body of a charter
18 school to contract with the board of trustees of the school district in which the charter school
19 is located to provide school police officers. (NRS 388A.384, 391.281) Section 2 of this bill
20 makes it a misdemeanor for a school police officer or employee of a school district in a county
21 whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) to use a chemical agent or
22 electronic stun device on a pupil or minor while: (1) on or in school grounds, property,
23 buildings or any other school district facilities; (2) on or in the grounds, property, buildings or
24 any other facilities in which a charter school is located, if the board of trustees of the school
25 district has entered into a contract with the charter school for the provision of school police
26 officers; or (3) at activities or events sponsored by the school district or charter school that are
27 not located on school property. Section 2 additionally requires that, if a school police officer
28 or employee of a school district uses or orders the use of a chemical agent or electronic stun
29 device against a pupil or minor, the school in which he or she is assigned or the metropolitan
30 police department or sheriff’s office that is his or her employer, as applicable, must prepare
31 and submit a report to the board of trustees of the school district in which the incident
32 occurred. Section 2 further requires: (1) certain information to be included in the report; (2)
33 the board of trustees of the school district to conduct an independent investigation of the
34 incident; (3) the board of trustees of the school district to determine whether the incident was
35 justified; and (4) the board of trustees of the school district to determine whether to change
36 certain policies and procedures of the school district or make recommendations for the
37 adoption or modification of certain policies to the metropolitan police department or sheriff’s
38 department.]
