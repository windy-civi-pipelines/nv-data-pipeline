3 immigration enforcement at certain public places, including public schools. (NRS
4 228.208) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a school district, public school or any

7 Enforcement officer, or other federal official engaging in the investigation or

8 enforcement of immigration laws: (1) permission to access the grounds, buildings
9 or facilities of a school district or public school; or (2) the education records of or
10 information about a pupil or the family or household of a pupil. Section 1
11 additionally applies the prohibition on the provision of the education records of or
12 information about a pupil or the family or household of a pupil to a state or local
13 law enforcement officer engaged in the investigation or enforcement of
14 immigration laws. Section 1 makes a violation of this prohibition punishable as a
15 misdemeanor.
16 Existing law authorizes: (1) the board of trustees of a school district to employ,
17 appoint or contract for the provision of school police officers; and (2) the governing
18 body of a charter school to contract with the board of trustees of the school district
19 in which the charter school is located to provide school police officers. (NRS
20 388A.384, 391.281) Section 2 of this bill makes it a misdemeanor for a school
21 police officer or employee of a school district in a county whose population is
22 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) to use a chemical agent or
23 electronic stun device on a pupil or minor while: (1) on or in school grounds,
24 property, buildings or any other school district facilities; (2) on or in the grounds,
25 property, buildings or any other facilities in which a charter school is located, if the

27 school for the provision of school police officers; or (3) at activities or events
28 sponsored by the school district or charter school that are not located on school
29 property. Section 2 additionally requires that, if a school police officer or employee
30 of a school district uses or orders the use of a chemical agent or electronic stun
31 device against a pupil or minor, the school in which he or she is assigned or the
32 metropolitan police department or sheriff’s office that is his or her employer, as
33 applicable, must prepare and submit a report to the board of trustees of the school
34 district in which the incident occurred. Section 2 further requires: (1) certain
35 information to be included in the report; (2) the board of trustees of the school
36 district to conduct an independent investigation of the incident; (3) the board of
37 trustees of the school district to determine whether the incident was justified; and
38 (4) the board of trustees of the school district to determine whether to change
39 certain policies and procedures of the school district or make recommendations for
40 the adoption or modification of certain policies to the metropolitan police
41 department or sheriff’s department.
