4 district, public school or any employee of a school district or public school, except pursuant to a
5 lawful court order or warrant, from providing a United States Immigration and Customs
6 Enforcement officer, or other federal official engaging in the investigation or enforcement of
7 immigration laws: (1) permission to access the grounds, buildings or facilities of a school district
8 or public school; or (2) the education records of or information about a pupil or the family or

10 education records of or information about a pupil or the family or household of a pupil to a state
11 or local law enforcement officer engaged in the investigation or enforcement of immigration
12 laws. Section 1 provides that a violation of this prohibition [: (1) for the first violation,] subjects
