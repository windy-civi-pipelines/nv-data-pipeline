CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting school districts, public
schools and their employees from providing permission to
access school district facilities to certain federal officials
investigating or enforcing immigration laws; prohibiting
school districts, public schools and their employees from
providing information concerning pupils to certain federal,
state or local officials investigating or enforcing immigration
laws; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Attorney General to publish model policies for
limiting, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with any applicable law,
immigration enforcement at certain public places, including public schools. (NRS
228.208) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a school district, public school or any
employee of a school district or public school, except pursuant to a lawful court
order or warrant, from providing a United States Immigration and Customs
Enforcement officer, or other federal official engaging in the investigation or
enforcement of immigration laws: (1) permission to access the grounds, buildings
or facilities of a school district or public school; or (2) the education records of or
information about a pupil or the family or household of a pupil. Section 1
additionally applies the prohibition on the provision of the education records of or
information about a pupil or the family or household of a pupil to a state or local
law enforcement officer engaged in the investigation or enforcement of
immigration laws. Section 1 provides that a violation of this prohibition subjects
the person who violated the provision to disciplinary action by the school district or
public school that employs the person.
