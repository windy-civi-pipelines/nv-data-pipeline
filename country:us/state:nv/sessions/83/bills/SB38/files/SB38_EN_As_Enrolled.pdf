Senate Bill No. 38–Committee on Education
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the Division of
Emergency Management of the Office of the Military to
disseminate certain school emergency operations plans to
local public safety agencies in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing
body of each charter school and the governing body of each private school to
establish a committee to develop a plan to be used by schools in responding to a
crisis, emergency or suicide and all other hazards. (NRS 388.241, 388.243,
394.1685, 394.1687) Under existing law, the committee is authorized to approve a
deviation from such a plan based on the specific needs and characteristics of a
particular school. (NRS 388.249, 388.251, 394.1691, 394.1692) Under existing
law, each plan, update to a plan or deviation from a plan is required to be provided
to: (1) the Division of Emergency Management of the Office of the Military; (2)
each local public safety agency in the county in which the school district or school,
as applicable, is located; and (3) the local organization for emergency management,
if any. (NRS 388.243, 388.245, 394.1688) Existing law prohibits the disclosure of a
plan, or an update to or deviation from a plan, to any person, government,
governmental agency or political subdivision of a government, with certain
exceptions. (NRS 388.259, 394.1698) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Division
to disseminate a plan, an update to a plan or a deviation from a plan to a local
public safety agency as the Division determines is reasonably necessary: (1) in the
event of an act of terrorism or related emergency; or (2) for emergency
preparedness, coordination and response efforts. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
exempt such disclosure by the Division from the prohibition on disclosure of such
plans, updates or deviations.
