3 establish a committee to develop a plan to be used by schools in responding to a
4 crisis, emergency or suicide and all other hazards. (NRS 388.241, 388.243,
5 394.1685, 394.1687) Under existing law, the committee is authorized to approve a
6 deviation from such a plan based on the specific needs and characteristics of a
7 particular school. (NRS 388.249, 388.251, 394.1691, 394.1692) Under existing
8 law, each plan, update to a plan or deviation from a plan is required to be provided

10 each local public safety agency in the county in which the school district or school,
11 as applicable, is located; and (3) the local organization for emergency management,
12 if any. (NRS 388.243, 388.245, 394.1688) Existing law prohibits the disclosure of a
13 plan, or an update to or deviation from a plan, to any person, government,
14 governmental agency or political subdivision of a government, with certain
15 exceptions. (NRS 388.259, 394.1698) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Division
16 to disseminate a plan, an update to a plan or a deviation from a plan to a local
17 public safety agency as the Division determines is reasonably necessary: (1) in the
18 event of an act of terrorism or related emergency; or (2) for emergency
