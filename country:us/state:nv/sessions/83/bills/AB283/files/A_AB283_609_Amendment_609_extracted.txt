EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; revising provisions relating to summary evictions;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law authorizes a landlord who seeks to recover possession of a
2 premises from a tenant to do so by filing an unlawful detainer action or an action for summary
3 eviction. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542, 40.290-40.420) Existing law prescribes separate
4 summary eviction procedures for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not
5 tenants of a commercial premises and who default in the payment of rent; (2) certain tenants
6 who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent; and
7 (3) certain tenants of a commercial premises who default in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253,
8 40.254, 40.2542)
9 In general, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require a landlord
10 to provide certain written notice to a tenant: (1) informing the tenant that he or she must take
11 certain action or surrender the premises on or before a date specified in the notice; and (2)
12 advising the tenant of his or her right to contest the matter by filing an affidavit with the court
13 that has jurisdiction over the matter. In so doing, the summary eviction procedures prescribed
14 by existing law require a tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court
15 concerning an action for summary eviction before a landlord is required to make any filing
16 concerning the matter. If such an affidavit is filed, a hearing is held. If no such affidavit is
17 filed, upon noncompliance of a tenant with the written notice, existing law authorizes: (1) the
18 landlord to apply by affidavit of complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) the
19 court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the tenant within a prescribed period.
20 (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542)
21 Section 20 of this bill repeals the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing
22 law for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial
23 premises and who default in the payment of rent; and (2) certain tenants who are guilty of
24 unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent. Sections 2-6 of this
25 bill reenact, reorganize and revise these procedures. Section 2 establishes a new procedure for
26 the summary eviction of certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and
27 who default in the payment of rent. Section 6 establishes a new procedure for the summary
28 eviction of certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default
29 in the payment of rent.
30 The new procedures for summary eviction set forth in sections 2 and 6 are similar to the
31 procedures repealed by section 20 except with regard to: (1) the required contents of a written
32 notice; (2) certain requirements relating to filings made with the court; and (3) the period
Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 4
33 before the removal of a tenant. Instead of requiring a tenant who contests a summary eviction
34 to file an affidavit in court before the landlord files a complaint, sections 2 and 6 require the
35 landlord, upon the expiration of certain notice provided to the tenant, to: (1) apply by affidavit
36 of complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) serve the tenant with a file-
37 stamped copy of the affidavit of complaint and a copy of the summons. Sections 2 and 6
38 additionally require the landlord to file with the court proof of service of the affidavit,
39 summons and notice within a prescribed period. Sections 2 and 6 require the tenant to file an
40 answer to the affidavit of complaint within 7 judicial days after the date of service. If a tenant
41 files an answer within the prescribed period, a hearing is held. If no such answer is filed,
42 sections 2 and 6 authorize the court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the
43 tenant within a prescribed period under certain circumstances. Sections 7-18 of this bill make
44 conforming changes relating to the repeal, revision and reorganization of the procedures for
45 summary eviction.
46 Existing law requires a court that grants an action for summary eviction for a default in
47 the payment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency to automatically seal the eviction case
48 court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 9 removes requirements relating to the COVID-19
49 emergency. Section 9 also requires a court to automatically seal the eviction case court file for
50 an action for summary eviction brought pursuant to section 2 or 6 under certain
51 circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes the amendatory provisions of sections 2-18
52 applicable to an action for summary eviction which accrues on or after October 1, 2025.

14 term less than life is guilty of an unlawful detainer when the tenant continues in
15 possession, in person or by subtenant, after a neglect or failure to perform any
16 condition or covenant of the lease or agreement under which the real property,
17 dwelling unit, recreational vehicle or mobile home is held, other than those

24 days after the service, the tenant, or any subtenant in actual occupation of the
25 premises or property, or any mortgagee of the term, or other person, interested in its

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS

Section 2:
40.253 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of summary eviction
and exclusion of tenant for default in payment of rent.

Section 3:
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in addition to the remedy
provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any
dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent
reserved by the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent, the
landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice in writing,
requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the premises:
(a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day following the day
of service; or
(b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth in paragraph
(a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or less and the tenancy has not
continued for more than 45 days, at or before noon of the fourth full day following
the day of service.
 As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the landlord or the
landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the tenant. If personal service was
not so delivered, the “day of service” means the day the notice is delivered, after
posting and mailing pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service
if the request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by the
sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall be deemed to be
the day next following the day that the request is made for service by the sheriff or
constable.

Section 4:
2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a tenant pursuant
to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 shall attempt to deliver the notice in person in the
manner set forth in subsection 2 of NRS 40.2542. If the notice cannot be delivered
in person, the landlord or the landlord’s agent:
(a) Shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises and
mail the notice by overnight mail; and
(b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the notice to the
sheriff or constable for service in the manner set forth in subsection 1 of NRS

Section 5:
40.280. The sheriff or constable shall not accept the notice for service unless it is
accompanied by written evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took
possession of the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful procedures for
eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall
Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 20
serve the notice within 48 hours after the request for service was made by the
landlord or the landlord’s agent.

Section 6:
3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
(a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
(b) Advise the tenant:
(1) Of the tenant’s right to contest the matter by filing, within the time
specified in subsection 1 for the payment of the rent or surrender of the premises,
an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter stating that the tenant
has tendered payment or is not in default in the payment of the rent;
(2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an unlawful
detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal of the tenant or an order
providing for the nonadmittance of the tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of
the county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24
hours after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or constable
shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the
posting of the order; and
(3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief if a landlord
unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the tenant by blocking
or attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or
causes or permits the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.

Section 7:
4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time stated in the notice,
the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt of a file-stamped copy of the
affidavit which was filed, shall not provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to
the premises by locking or otherwise.

Section 8:
5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
(a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit of complaint
for eviction to the justice court of the township in which the dwelling, apartment,
mobile home or recreational vehicle are located or to the district court of the county
in which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are located,
whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may thereupon issue an order
directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the order in a conspicuous
place on the premises not later than 24 hours after the order is received by the
sheriff or constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than
24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of the order. The affidavit
must state or contain:
(1) The date the tenancy commenced.
(2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
(3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits paid in advance,
in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
(4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
(5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession without
paying rent.
(6) The amount of rent claimed due and delinquent.
(7) A statement that the written notice was served on the tenant in
accordance with NRS 40.280.
(8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.
(9) A copy of the signed written rental agreement, if any.
(b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit described in
subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been received by the landlord or the
landlord’s agent, and except when the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS
118A.480, the landlord or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide
for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 21

Section 9:
6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in subsection 3,
regardless of the information contained in the affidavit, and the filing by the
landlord of the affidavit permitted by subsection 5, the justice court or the district
court shall hold a hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice provided for in
this section. If the court determines that there is no legal defense as to the alleged
unlawful detainer and the tenant is guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may
issue a summary order for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a legal defense as
to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall refuse to grant either party any
relief, and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, shall require that any
further proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive. The
issuance of a summary order for removal of the tenant does not preclude an action
by the tenant for any damages or other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If
the alleged unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord thereafter from
pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in accordance with NRS 40.251.

Section 10:
7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees relating to the filing
and service of a motion, file a motion with the court, on a form provided by the
clerk of the court, to dispute the amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord
pursuant to NRS 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20 days after the
summary order for removal of the tenant or the abandonment of the premises by the
tenant, or within 20 days after:
(a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises; and
(b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided to the tenant,
 whichever is later.

Section 11:
8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the court shall
schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 10 days after the
filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of the hearing to the motion and
order a copy served upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process
server. At the hearing, the court may:
(a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
(b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment of the charges
determined to be due or if no charges are determined to be due.

Section 12:
9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees relating to the filing
and service of a motion, file a motion with the court on a form provided by the
clerk of court to dispute the reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the filing of a motion
pursuant to this subsection, the court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The
hearing must be held within 5 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the
landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the court
may:
(a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s essential personal
effects at the date and time and for a period necessary for the retrieval, as
determined by the court; and
(b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.

Section 13:
10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded under
paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall consider:
(a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 22
(b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant; and
(c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s conduct.

Section 14:
11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that is submitted
after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or had served a notice pursuant
to subsection 1 if the refusal is based on the fact that the tenant has not paid
collection fees, attorney’s fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable charge
for late payments of rent or dishonored checks, or a security deposit. As used in this
subsection, “security deposit” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 118A.240.

Section 15:
12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this section does not
apply to:
(a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to the tenant of a
recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home park in this State other than an
area designated as a recreational vehicle lot pursuant to the provisions of subsection
8 of NRS 40.215.
(b) A tenant who provides proof to the landlord that he or she is a federal
worker, tribal worker, state worker or household member of such a worker during a
shutdown.

Section 16:
13. As used in this section, “close of business” means the close of business of
the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.

Section 17:
40.254 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of summary eviction
and exclusion of tenant from certain types of property.

Section 18:
1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, in addition to the remedy
provided in NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of a dwelling unit,
part of a low-rent housing program operated by a public housing authority, a mobile
home or a recreational vehicle is guilty of an unlawful detainer pursuant to NRS

Section 19:
40.250, 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, the landlord or the landlord’s agent may utilize
the summary procedures for eviction as provided in NRS 40.253 except that written
notice to surrender the premises must:
(a) Be given to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of NRS 40.280;
(b) Advise the tenant of the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
(c) Advise the tenant of the tenant’s right to:
(1) Contest the notice by filing before the court’s close of business on the
fifth judicial day after the day of service of the notice an affidavit with the court
that has jurisdiction over the matter stating the reasons why the tenant is not guilty
of an unlawful detainer; or
(2) Request that the court stay the execution of the order for removal of the
tenant or order providing for nonadmittance of the tenant for a period not exceeding
10 days pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 70.010, stating the reasons why such a
stay is warranted.

Section 20:
2. The affidavit of the landlord or the landlord’s agent submitted to the justice
court or the district court must state or contain:
(a) The date when the tenancy commenced, the term of the tenancy and, if any,
a copy of the rental agreement. If the rental agreement has been lost or destroyed,

(b) The date when the tenancy or rental agreement allegedly terminated.
(c) The date when written notice to surrender was given to the tenant pursuant
to the provisions of NRS 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, together with any facts

statement that notice was served in accordance with NRS 40.280 and, if applicable,
a copy of the notice of change of ownership served on the tenant pursuant to NRS

Section 21:
40.255 if the property has been purchased as a residential foreclosure.
Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 23
(e) A statement that the claim for relief was authorized by law.

Section 22:
3. If the tenant is found guilty of unlawful detainer as a result of the tenant’s
violation of any of the provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except
NRS 453.336, the landlord is entitled to be awarded any reasonable attorney’s fees
incurred by the landlord or the landlord’s agent as a result of a hearing, if any, held

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing certain actions and proceedings
relating to real property. (BDR 3-819)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; revising provisions relating to summary evictions;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law authorizes a landlord who seeks to recover possession of a
2 premises from a tenant to do so by filing an unlawful detainer action or an action for summary
3 eviction. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542, 40.290-40.420) Existing law prescribes separate
4 summary eviction procedures for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not
5 tenants of a commercial premises and who default in the payment of rent; (2) certain tenants
6 who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent; and
7 (3) certain tenants of a commercial premises who default in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253,
8 40.254, 40.2542)
9 In general, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require a landlord
10 to provide certain written notice to a tenant: (1) informing the tenant that he or she must take
11 certain action or surrender the premises on or before a date specified in the notice; and (2)
12 advising the tenant of his or her right to contest the matter by filing an affidavit with the court
13 that has jurisdiction over the matter. In so doing, the summary eviction procedures prescribed
14 by existing law require a tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court
15 concerning an action for summary eviction before a landlord is required to make any filing
16 concerning the matter. If such an affidavit is filed, a hearing is held. If no such affidavit is
17 filed, upon noncompliance of a tenant with the written notice, existing law authorizes: (1) the
18 landlord to apply by affidavit of complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) the
19 court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the tenant within a prescribed period.
20 (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542)
21 Section 20 of this bill repeals the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing
22 law for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial
23 premises and who default in the payment of rent; and (2) certain tenants who are guilty of
24 unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent. Sections 2-6 of this
25 bill reenact, reorganize and revise these procedures. Section 2 establishes a new procedure for
26 the summary eviction of certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and
27 who default in the payment of rent. Section 6 establishes a new procedure for the summary
28 eviction of certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default
29 in the payment of rent.
30 The new procedures for summary eviction set forth in sections 2 and 6 are similar to the
31 procedures repealed by section 20 except with regard to: (1) the required contents of a written
32 notice; (2) certain requirements relating to filings made with the court; and (3) the period

Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 4
33 before the removal of a tenant. Instead of requiring a tenant who contests a summary eviction
34 to file an affidavit in court before the landlord files a complaint, sections 2 and 6 require the
35 landlord, upon the expiration of certain notice provided to the tenant, to: (1) apply by affidavit
36 of complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) serve the tenant with a file-
37 stamped copy of the affidavit of complaint and a copy of the summons. Sections 2 and 6
38 additionally require the landlord to file with the court proof of service of the affidavit,
39 summons and notice within a prescribed period. Sections 2 and 6 require the tenant to file an
40 answer to the affidavit of complaint within 7 judicial days after the date of service. If a tenant
41 files an answer within the prescribed period, a hearing is held. If no such answer is filed,
42 sections 2 and 6 authorize the court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the
43 tenant within a prescribed period under certain circumstances. Sections 7-18 of this bill make
44 conforming changes relating to the repeal, revision and reorganization of the procedures for
45 summary eviction.
46 Existing law requires a court that grants an action for summary eviction for a default in
47 the payment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency to automatically seal the eviction case
48 court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 9 removes requirements relating to the COVID-19
49 emergency. Section 9 also requires a court to automatically seal the eviction case court file for
50 an action for summary eviction brought pursuant to section 2 or 6 under certain
51 circumstances. Section 19 of this bill makes the amendatory provisions of sections 2-18
52 applicable to an action for summary eviction which accrues on or after October 1, 2025.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

18 5. A landlord or landlord’s agent who applies for summary eviction
19 pursuant to subsection 3 shall, within:
20 (a) [Fifteen] Twenty-one calendar days after the date on which the affidavit
21 of complaint for summary eviction is filed, serve upon the tenant a file-stamped
22 copy of the affidavit of complaint, with or without a copy of the signed rental

24 (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, the tenant must file a
25 written answer to the affidavit of complaint for summary eviction with the court
26 that has jurisdiction over the matter not later than 7 judicial days after service of
27 the affidavit of complaint for summary eviction;

30 tenant or providing for the nonadmittance of the tenant;
31 (3) Pursuant to NRS 118A.390, the tenant may seek relief if a landlord
32 unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the tenant by
33 blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the premises or willfully
34 interrupts or causes or permits the interruption of an essential item or service
35 required by the rental agreement or chapter 118A of NRS; and
36 (4) The tenant may request that the court stay the execution of the
37 summary order for the removal of the tenant or providing for the nonadmittance

50 the tenant in writing of his or her intention to dispose of the property and 14 days
51 have elapsed since the notice was given to the tenant. The notice must be mailed to
52 the tenant at the tenant’s present address, and if that address is unknown, then at the
53 tenant’s last known address.

4 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 may be resolved using the procedure
5 provided in [subsection 7 of NRS 40.253.] section 4 of this act.
6 3. During the 5-day period following the eviction or lockout of a tenant, the

31 that use if the notices required by NRS 453.305 have been given in connection with

2 arrested or convicted; and
3 (e) Advise the owner that:
4 (1) The property or mobile home is subject to forfeiture pursuant to NRS
5 179.1156 to 179.1205, inclusive, and 453.301 unless the tenant, if convicted, is

13 authorize the supplemental remedy of summary eviction to facilitate the owner’s
14 recovery of the property or mobile home upon such a violation and provide for the

16 4. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude the commencement of a
17 proceeding for forfeiture or the forfeiture of the property or mobile home, whether
18 or not the notices required by this section are given as required, if the proceeding
19 and forfeiture are otherwise authorized pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.1205,
20 inclusive, and 453.301.
21 5. As used in this section, “tenant” means any person entitled under a written
22 or oral rental agreement to occupy real property or a mobile home to the exclusion
23 of others.
24 Sec. 18. NRS 645H.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:

46 acts in storing the property.
47 (b) After the expiration of the 30-day period, the asset management company
48 may dispose of the property and recover his or her reasonable costs from the
49 property or the value thereof if the asset management company has made
50 reasonable efforts to locate the homeowner or the tenant of the homeowner, has
51 notified the homeowner or the tenant of the homeowner in writing of his or her
52 intention to dispose of the property and 14 days have elapsed since the notice was

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
40.253 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of summary eviction
and exclusion of tenant for default in payment of rent.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in addition to the remedy
provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any
dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent
reserved by the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent, the
landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice in writing,
requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the premises:
(a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day following the day
of service; or
(b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth in paragraph
(a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or less and the tenancy has not
continued for more than 45 days, at or before noon of the fourth full day following
the day of service.
 As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the landlord or the
landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the tenant. If personal service was
not so delivered, the “day of service” means the day the notice is delivered, after
posting and mailing pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service
if the request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by the
sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall be deemed to be
the day next following the day that the request is made for service by the sheriff or
constable.
2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a tenant pursuant
to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 shall attempt to deliver the notice in person in the
manner set forth in subsection 2 of NRS 40.2542. If the notice cannot be delivered
in person, the landlord or the landlord’s agent:
(a) Shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises and
mail the notice by overnight mail; and
(b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the notice to the
sheriff or constable for service in the manner set forth in subsection 1 of NRS
40.280. The sheriff or constable shall not accept the notice for service unless it is
accompanied by written evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took
possession of the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful procedures for
eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall

Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 20
serve the notice within 48 hours after the request for service was made by the
landlord or the landlord’s agent.
3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
(a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
(b) Advise the tenant:
(1) Of the tenant’s right to contest the matter by filing, within the time
specified in subsection 1 for the payment of the rent or surrender of the premises,
an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter stating that the tenant
has tendered payment or is not in default in the payment of the rent;
(2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an unlawful
detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal of the tenant or an order
providing for the nonadmittance of the tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of
the county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24
hours after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or constable
shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the
posting of the order; and
(3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief if a landlord
unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the tenant by blocking
or attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or
causes or permits the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time stated in the notice,
the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt of a file-stamped copy of the
affidavit which was filed, shall not provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to
the premises by locking or otherwise.
5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
(a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit of complaint
for eviction to the justice court of the township in which the dwelling, apartment,
mobile home or recreational vehicle are located or to the district court of the county
in which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are located,
whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may thereupon issue an order
directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the order in a conspicuous
place on the premises not later than 24 hours after the order is received by the
sheriff or constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than
24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of the order. The affidavit
must state or contain:
(1) The date the tenancy commenced.
(2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
(3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits paid in advance,
in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
(4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
(5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession without
paying rent.
(6) The amount of rent claimed due and delinquent.
(7) A statement that the written notice was served on the tenant in
accordance with NRS 40.280.
(8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.
(9) A copy of the signed written rental agreement, if any.
(b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit described in
subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been received by the landlord or the
landlord’s agent, and except when the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS
118A.480, the landlord or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide
for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.

Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 21
6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in subsection 3,
regardless of the information contained in the affidavit, and the filing by the
landlord of the affidavit permitted by subsection 5, the justice court or the district
court shall hold a hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice provided for in
this section. If the court determines that there is no legal defense as to the alleged
unlawful detainer and the tenant is guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may
issue a summary order for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a legal defense as
to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall refuse to grant either party any
relief, and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, shall require that any
further proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive. The
issuance of a summary order for removal of the tenant does not preclude an action
by the tenant for any damages or other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If
the alleged unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord thereafter from
pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in accordance with NRS 40.251.
7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees relating to the filing
and service of a motion, file a motion with the court, on a form provided by the
clerk of the court, to dispute the amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord
pursuant to NRS 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20 days after the
summary order for removal of the tenant or the abandonment of the premises by the
tenant, or within 20 days after:
(a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises; and
(b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided to the tenant,
 whichever is later.
8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the court shall
schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 10 days after the
filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of the hearing to the motion and
order a copy served upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process
server. At the hearing, the court may:
(a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
(b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment of the charges
determined to be due or if no charges are determined to be due.
9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees relating to the filing
and service of a motion, file a motion with the court on a form provided by the
clerk of court to dispute the reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the filing of a motion
pursuant to this subsection, the court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The
hearing must be held within 5 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the
landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the court
may:
(a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s essential personal
effects at the date and time and for a period necessary for the retrieval, as
determined by the court; and
(b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded under
paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall consider:
(a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;

Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 22
(b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant; and
(c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s conduct.
11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that is submitted
after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or had served a notice pursuant
to subsection 1 if the refusal is based on the fact that the tenant has not paid
collection fees, attorney’s fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable charge
for late payments of rent or dishonored checks, or a security deposit. As used in this
subsection, “security deposit” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 118A.240.
12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this section does not
apply to:
(a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to the tenant of a
recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home park in this State other than an
area designated as a recreational vehicle lot pursuant to the provisions of subsection
8 of NRS 40.215.
(b) A tenant who provides proof to the landlord that he or she is a federal
worker, tribal worker, state worker or household member of such a worker during a
shutdown.
13. As used in this section, “close of business” means the close of business of
the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.
40.254 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of summary eviction
and exclusion of tenant from certain types of property.
1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, in addition to the remedy
provided in NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of a dwelling unit,
part of a low-rent housing program operated by a public housing authority, a mobile
home or a recreational vehicle is guilty of an unlawful detainer pursuant to NRS
40.250, 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, the landlord or the landlord’s agent may utilize
the summary procedures for eviction as provided in NRS 40.253 except that written
notice to surrender the premises must:
(a) Be given to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of NRS 40.280;
(b) Advise the tenant of the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
(c) Advise the tenant of the tenant’s right to:
(1) Contest the notice by filing before the court’s close of business on the
fifth judicial day after the day of service of the notice an affidavit with the court
that has jurisdiction over the matter stating the reasons why the tenant is not guilty
of an unlawful detainer; or
(2) Request that the court stay the execution of the order for removal of the
tenant or order providing for nonadmittance of the tenant for a period not exceeding
10 days pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 70.010, stating the reasons why such a
stay is warranted.
2. The affidavit of the landlord or the landlord’s agent submitted to the justice
court or the district court must state or contain:
(a) The date when the tenancy commenced, the term of the tenancy and, if any,
a copy of the rental agreement. If the rental agreement has been lost or destroyed,
the landlord or the landlord’s agent may attach an affidavit or declaration, signed
under penalty of perjury, stating such loss or destruction.
(b) The date when the tenancy or rental agreement allegedly terminated.
(c) The date when written notice to surrender was given to the tenant pursuant
to the provisions of NRS 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, together with any facts
supporting the notice.
(d) The date when the written notice was given, a copy of the notice and a
statement that notice was served in accordance with NRS 40.280 and, if applicable,
a copy of the notice of change of ownership served on the tenant pursuant to NRS
40.255 if the property has been purchased as a residential foreclosure.

Senate Amendment No. 609 to Assembly Bill No. 283 Page 23
(e) A statement that the claim for relief was authorized by law.
3. If the tenant is found guilty of unlawful detainer as a result of the tenant’s
violation of any of the provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except
NRS 453.336, the landlord is entitled to be awarded any reasonable attorney’s fees
incurred by the landlord or the landlord’s agent as a result of a hearing, if any, held
pursuant to subsection 6 of NRS 40.253 wherein the tenant contested the eviction.
