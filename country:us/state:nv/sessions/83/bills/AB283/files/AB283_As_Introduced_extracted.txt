EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; revising provisions relating to
summary evictions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law authorizes a landlord who seeks to recover possession
2 of a premises from a tenant to do so by filing an unlawful detainer action or an
3 action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542, 40.290-40.420)
4 Existing law prescribes separate summary eviction procedures for the summary
5 eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and
6 who default in the payment of rent; (2) certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful
7 detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent; and (3) certain
8 tenants of a commercial premises who default in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253,
9 40.254, 40.2542)
10 In general, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require
11 a landlord to provide certain written notice to a tenant: (1) informing the tenant that
12 he or she must take certain action or surrender the premises on or before a date
13 specified in the notice; and (2) advising the tenant of his or her right to contest the
14 matter by filing an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter. In
15 so doing, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require a
16 tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court concerning an
17 action for summary eviction before a landlord is required to make any filing
18 concerning the matter. If such an affidavit is filed, a hearing is held. If no such
19 affidavit is filed, upon noncompliance of a tenant with the written notice, existing
20 law authorizes: (1) the landlord to apply by affidavit of complaint for the summary
21 eviction of the tenant; and (2) the court, without holding a hearing, to order the
22 removal of the tenant within a prescribed period. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542)
23 Section 20 of this bill repeals the summary eviction procedures prescribed by
24 existing law for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of
25 a commercial premises and who default in the payment of rent; and (2) certain
26 tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the
27 payment of rent. Sections 2-6 of this bill reenact, reorganize and revise these

28 procedures. Section 2 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
29 certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and who default in the
30 payment of rent. Section 6 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
31 certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default
32 in the payment of rent.
33 The new procedures for summary eviction set forth in sections 2 and 6 are
34 similar to the procedures repealed by section 20 except with regard to: (1) the
35 required contents of a written notice; (2) certain requirements relating to filings
36 made with the court; and (3) the period before the removal of a tenant. Instead of
37 requiring a tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court
38 before the landlord files a complaint, sections 2 and 6 require the landlord, upon
39 the expiration of certain notice provided to the tenant, to: (1) apply by affidavit of
40 complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) serve the tenant with a
41 file-stamped copy of the affidavit of complaint and a copy of the summons.
42 Sections 2 and 6 additionally require the landlord to file with the court proof of
43 service of the affidavit, summons and notice within a prescribed period. Sections 2
44 and 6 require the tenant to file an answer to the affidavit of complaint within 7
45 judicial days after the date of service. If a tenant files an answer within the
46 prescribed period, a hearing is held. If no such answer is filed, sections 2 and 6
47 authorize the court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the tenant
48 within a prescribed period under certain circumstances. Sections 7-18 of this bill
49 make conforming changes relating to the repeal, revision and reorganization of the
50 procedures for summary eviction.
51 Existing law requires a court that grants an action for summary eviction for a
52 default in the payment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency to automatically
53 seal the eviction case court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 9 removes requirements
54 relating to the COVID-19 emergency. Section 9 also requires a court to
55 automatically seal the eviction case court file for an action for summary eviction
56 brought pursuant to section 2 or 6 under certain circumstances. Section 19 of this
57 bill makes the amendatory provisions of sections 2-18 applicable to an action for
58 summary eviction which accrues on or after October 1, 2025.

28 holder of a lien or encumbrance on the property or mobile home is
29 disputably presumed to have acquired an interest in the property for
30 fair value and without knowledge or consent to such use, regardless
31 of when the act giving rise to the forfeiture occurred.
32 Sec. 17. NRS 453.305 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 453.305 1. Whenever a person is arrested for violating any of
34 the provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except NRS
35 453.336, and real property or a mobile home occupied by the person
36 as a tenant has been used to facilitate the violation, the prosecuting
37 attorney responsible for the case shall cause to be delivered to the
38 owner of the property or mobile home a written notice of the arrest.
39 2. Whenever a person is convicted of violating any of the
40 provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except NRS
41 453.336, and real property or a mobile home occupied by the person

13 (2) Any similar violation by the same tenant in the future
14 may also result in the forfeiture of the property unless the tenant has
15 been evicted;
16 (3) In any proceeding for forfeiture based upon such a
17 violation the owner will, by reason of the notice, be deemed to have
18 known of and consented to the unlawful use of the property or
19 mobile home; and
20 (4) The provisions of NRS 40.2514 and [40.254] section 6 of
21 this act authorize the supplemental remedy of summary eviction to
22 facilitate the owner’s recovery of the property or mobile home upon
23 such a violation and provide for the recovery of any reasonable

28 section are given as required, if the proceeding and forfeiture are
29 otherwise authorized pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.1205,

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS

Section 2:
40.253 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of
summary eviction and exclusion of tenant for default in
payment of rent.

Section 3:
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in addition to
the remedy provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to 40.420,
inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment, mobile home
or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by the month or
any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent, the landlord
or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice in writing,
requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender
of the premises:
(a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
following the day of service; or
(b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or
before noon of the fourth full day following the day of service.
 As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the
landlord or the landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the
tenant. If personal service was not so delivered, the “day of service”
means the day the notice is delivered, after posting and mailing
pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service if the
request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by
the sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall
be deemed to be the day next following the day that the request is
made for service by the sheriff or constable.

Section 4:
2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a
tenant pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 shall attempt to
deliver the notice in person in the manner set forth in subsection 2 of
NRS 40.2542. If the notice cannot be delivered in person, the
landlord or the landlord’s agent:
(a) Shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the
premises and mail the notice by overnight mail; and
(b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the
notice to the sheriff or constable for service in the manner set forth
in subsection 1 of NRS 40.280. The sheriff or constable shall not
accept the notice for service unless it is accompanied by written
evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took possession of
the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
-
*AB283*
– 24 –
tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the
landlord’s agent.

Section 5:
3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
(a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
(b) Advise the tenant:
(1) Of the tenant’s right to contest the matter by filing, within
the time specified in subsection 1 for the payment of the rent or
surrender of the premises, an affidavit with the court that has
jurisdiction over the matter stating that the tenant has tendered
payment or is not in default in the payment of the rent;
(2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an
unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal
of the tenant or an order providing for the nonadmittance of the
tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the
order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24 hours
after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or
constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not
later than 36 hours after the posting of the order; and
(3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief
if a landlord unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or
excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s
entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or causes or permits
the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.

Section 6:
4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
locking or otherwise.

Section 7:
5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
(a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
are located or to the district court of the county in which the
dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are
located, whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may
thereupon issue an order directing the sheriff or constable of the
county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not
later than 24 hours after the order is received by the sheriff or
constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not
earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of
the order. The affidavit must state or contain:
-
*AB283*
– 25 –
(1) The date the tenancy commenced.
(2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
(3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits
paid in advance, in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
(4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
(5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession
without paying rent.
(6) The amount of rent claimed due and delinquent.
(7) A statement that the written notice was served on the
tenant in accordance with NRS 40.280.
(8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.
(9) A copy of the signed written rental agreement, if any.
(b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit
described in subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been
received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.

Section 8:
6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
accordance with NRS 40.251.

Section 9:
7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the
amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
-
*AB283*
– 26 –
property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20
days after the summary order for removal of the tenant or the
abandonment of the premises by the tenant, or within 20 days after:
(a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises;
and
(b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided
to the tenant,
 whichever is later.

Section 10:
8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
At the hearing, the court may:
(a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
(b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
to be due.

Section 11:
9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
court may:
(a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s
essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
(b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.

Section 12:
10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall
consider:
(a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
(b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant;
and
(c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s
conduct.

Section 13:
11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that
is submitted after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or
-
*AB283*
– 27 –
had served a notice pursuant to subsection 1 if the refusal is based
on the fact that the tenant has not paid collection fees, attorney’s
fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable charge for late
payments of rent or dishonored checks, or a security deposit. As
used in this subsection, “security deposit” has the meaning ascribed
to it in NRS 118A.240.

Section 14:
12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this

Section 15:
section does not apply to:
(a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to
the tenant of a recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home
park in this State other than an area designated as a recreational
vehicle lot pursuant to the provisions of subsection 8 of
NRS 40.215.
(b) A tenant who provides proof to the landlord that he or she is
a federal worker, tribal worker, state worker or household member
of such a worker during a shutdown.

Section 16:
13. As used in this section, “close of business” means the close
of business of the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.

Section 17:
40.254 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of
summary eviction and exclusion of tenant from certain types of
property.

Section 18:
1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, in addition
to the remedy provided in NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive, when
the tenant of a dwelling unit, part of a low-rent housing program
operated by a public housing authority, a mobile home or a
recreational vehicle is guilty of an unlawful detainer pursuant to
NRS 40.250, 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, the landlord or the
landlord’s agent may utilize the summary procedures for eviction as
provided in NRS 40.253 except that written notice to surrender the
premises must:
(a) Be given to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of
NRS 40.280;
(b) Advise the tenant of the court that has jurisdiction over the
matter; and
(c) Advise the tenant of the tenant’s right to:
(1) Contest the notice by filing before the court’s close of
business on the fifth judicial day after the day of service of the
notice an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter
stating the reasons why the tenant is not guilty of an unlawful
detainer; or
(2) Request that the court stay the execution of the order for

A.B. 283
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 283–ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARTER
FEBRUARY 25, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing certain actions and
proceedings relating to real property. (BDR 3-819)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; revising provisions relating to
summary evictions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law authorizes a landlord who seeks to recover possession
2 of a premises from a tenant to do so by filing an unlawful detainer action or an
3 action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542, 40.290-40.420)
4 Existing law prescribes separate summary eviction procedures for the summary
5 eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and
6 who default in the payment of rent; (2) certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful
7 detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent; and (3) certain
8 tenants of a commercial premises who default in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253,
9 40.254, 40.2542)
10 In general, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require
11 a landlord to provide certain written notice to a tenant: (1) informing the tenant that
12 he or she must take certain action or surrender the premises on or before a date
13 specified in the notice; and (2) advising the tenant of his or her right to contest the
14 matter by filing an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter. In
15 so doing, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require a
16 tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court concerning an
17 action for summary eviction before a landlord is required to make any filing
18 concerning the matter. If such an affidavit is filed, a hearing is held. If no such
19 affidavit is filed, upon noncompliance of a tenant with the written notice, existing
20 law authorizes: (1) the landlord to apply by affidavit of complaint for the summary
21 eviction of the tenant; and (2) the court, without holding a hearing, to order the
22 removal of the tenant within a prescribed period. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542)
23 Section 20 of this bill repeals the summary eviction procedures prescribed by
24 existing law for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of
25 a commercial premises and who default in the payment of rent; and (2) certain
26 tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the
27 payment of rent. Sections 2-6 of this bill reenact, reorganize and revise these
-

– 2 –
28 procedures. Section 2 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
29 certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and who default in the
30 payment of rent. Section 6 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
31 certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default
32 in the payment of rent.
33 The new procedures for summary eviction set forth in sections 2 and 6 are
34 similar to the procedures repealed by section 20 except with regard to: (1) the
35 required contents of a written notice; (2) certain requirements relating to filings
36 made with the court; and (3) the period before the removal of a tenant. Instead of
37 requiring a tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court
38 before the landlord files a complaint, sections 2 and 6 require the landlord, upon
39 the expiration of certain notice provided to the tenant, to: (1) apply by affidavit of
40 complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) serve the tenant with a
41 file-stamped copy of the affidavit of complaint and a copy of the summons.
42 Sections 2 and 6 additionally require the landlord to file with the court proof of
43 service of the affidavit, summons and notice within a prescribed period. Sections 2
44 and 6 require the tenant to file an answer to the affidavit of complaint within 7
45 judicial days after the date of service. If a tenant files an answer within the
46 prescribed period, a hearing is held. If no such answer is filed, sections 2 and 6
47 authorize the court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the tenant
48 within a prescribed period under certain circumstances. Sections 7-18 of this bill
49 make conforming changes relating to the repeal, revision and reorganization of the
50 procedures for summary eviction.
51 Existing law requires a court that grants an action for summary eviction for a
52 default in the payment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency to automatically
53 seal the eviction case court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 9 removes requirements
54 relating to the COVID-19 emergency. Section 9 also requires a court to
55 automatically seal the eviction case court file for an action for summary eviction
56 brought pursuant to section 2 or 6 under certain circumstances. Section 19 of this
57 bill makes the amendatory provisions of sections 2-18 applicable to an action for
58 summary eviction which accrues on or after October 1, 2025.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
40.253 Unlawful detainer: Supplemental remedy of
summary eviction and exclusion of tenant for default in
payment of rent.
1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in addition to
the remedy provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to 40.420,
inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment, mobile home
or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by the month or
any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent, the landlord
or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice in writing,
requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender
of the premises:
(a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
following the day of service; or
(b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or
before noon of the fourth full day following the day of service.
 As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the
landlord or the landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the
tenant. If personal service was not so delivered, the “day of service”
means the day the notice is delivered, after posting and mailing
pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service if the
request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by
the sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall
be deemed to be the day next following the day that the request is
made for service by the sheriff or constable.
2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a
tenant pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 shall attempt to
deliver the notice in person in the manner set forth in subsection 2 of
NRS 40.2542. If the notice cannot be delivered in person, the
landlord or the landlord’s agent:
(a) Shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the
premises and mail the notice by overnight mail; and
(b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the
notice to the sheriff or constable for service in the manner set forth
in subsection 1 of NRS 40.280. The sheriff or constable shall not
accept the notice for service unless it is accompanied by written
evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took possession of
the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
-
*AB283*

– 24 –
tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the
landlord’s agent.
3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
(a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
(b) Advise the tenant:
(1) Of the tenant’s right to contest the matter by filing, within
the time specified in subsection 1 for the payment of the rent or
surrender of the premises, an affidavit with the court that has
jurisdiction over the matter stating that the tenant has tendered
payment or is not in default in the payment of the rent;
(2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an
unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal
of the tenant or an order providing for the nonadmittance of the
tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the
order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24 hours
after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or
constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not
later than 36 hours after the posting of the order; and
(3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief
if a landlord unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or
excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s
entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or causes or permits
the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
locking or otherwise.
5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
(a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
are located or to the district court of the county in which the
dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are
located, whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may
thereupon issue an order directing the sheriff or constable of the
county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not
later than 24 hours after the order is received by the sheriff or
constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not
earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of
the order. The affidavit must state or contain:
-
*AB283*

– 25 –
(1) The date the tenancy commenced.
(2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
(3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits
paid in advance, in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
(4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
(5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession
without paying rent.
(6) The amount of rent claimed due and delinquent.
(7) A statement that the written notice was served on the
tenant in accordance with NRS 40.280.
(8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.
(9) A copy of the signed written rental agreement, if any.
(b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit
described in subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been
received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
accordance with NRS 40.251.
7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the
amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
-
*AB283*

– 26 –
property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20
days after the summary order for removal of the tenant or the
abandonment of the premises by the tenant, or within 20 days after:
(a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises;
and
(b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided
to the tenant,
 whichever is later.
8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
At the hearing, the court may:
(a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
(b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
to be due.
9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
court may:
(a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s
essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
(b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall
consider:
(a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
(b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant;
and
(c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s
conduct.
11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that
is submitted after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or
-
*AB283*

– 27 –
had served a notice pursuant to subsection 1 if the refusal is based
on the fact that the tenant has not paid collection fees, attorney’s
fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable charge for late
payments of rent or dishonored checks, or a security deposit. As
used in this subsection, “security deposit” has the meaning ascribed
to it in NRS 118A.240.
12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this
section does not apply to:
(a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to
the tenant of a recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home
park in this State other than an area designated as a recreational
vehicle lot pursuant to the provisions of subsection 8 of
NRS 40.215.
(b) A tenant who provides proof to the landlord that he or she is
a federal worker, tribal worker, state worker or household member
of such a worker during a shutdown.

of business of the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.

summary eviction and exclusion of tenant from certain types of
property.

to the remedy provided in NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive, when
the tenant of a dwelling unit, part of a low-rent housing program
operated by a public housing authority, a mobile home or a
recreational vehicle is guilty of an unlawful detainer pursuant to
NRS 40.250, 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, the landlord or the
landlord’s agent may utilize the summary procedures for eviction as
provided in NRS 40.253 except that written notice to surrender the
premises must:
(a) Be given to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of
NRS 40.280;
(b) Advise the tenant of the court that has jurisdiction over the
matter; and
(c) Advise the tenant of the tenant’s right to:
(1) Contest the notice by filing before the court’s close of
business on the fifth judicial day after the day of service of the
notice an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter
stating the reasons why the tenant is not guilty of an unlawful
detainer; or
(2) Request that the court stay the execution of the order for
removal of the tenant or order providing for nonadmittance of the
