Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to property; revising provisions relating to
summary evictions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In general, existing law authorizes a landlord who seeks to recover possession
of a premises from a tenant to do so by filing an unlawful detainer action or an
action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542, 40.290-40.420)
Existing law prescribes separate summary eviction procedures for the summary
eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and
who default in the payment of rent; (2) certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful
detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent; and (3) certain
tenants of a commercial premises who default in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253,

Section 2:
40.254, 40.2542)
In general, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require
a landlord to provide certain written notice to a tenant: (1) informing the tenant that
he or she must take certain action or surrender the premises on or before a date
specified in the notice; and (2) advising the tenant of his or her right to contest the
matter by filing an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter. In
so doing, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require a
tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court concerning an
action for summary eviction before a landlord is required to make any filing
concerning the matter. If such an affidavit is filed, a hearing is held. If no such
affidavit is filed, upon noncompliance of a tenant with the written notice, existing
law authorizes: (1) the landlord to apply by affidavit of complaint for the summary
eviction of the tenant; and (2) the court, without holding a hearing, to order the
removal of the tenant within a prescribed period. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542)

Section 3:
Section 20 of this bill repeals the summary eviction procedures prescribed by
existing law for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of
a commercial premises and who default in the payment of rent; and (2) certain
tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the
payment of rent. Sections 2-6 of this bill reenact, reorganize and revise these
procedures. Section 2 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and who default in the
payment of rent. Section 6 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default
in the payment of rent.
The new procedures for summary eviction set forth in sections 2 and 6 are
similar to the procedures repealed by section 20 except with regard to: (1) the
required contents of a written notice; (2) certain requirements relating to filings
made with the court; and (3) the period before the removal of a tenant. Instead of
requiring a tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court
before the landlord files a complaint, sections 2 and 6 require the landlord, upon
the expiration of certain notice provided to the tenant, to: (1) apply by affidavit of
complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) serve the tenant with a
file-stamped copy of the affidavit of complaint and a copy of the summons.

Section 4:
Sections 2 and 6 additionally require the landlord to file with the court proof of
service of the affidavit, summons and notice within a prescribed period. Sections 2
and 6 require the tenant to file an answer to the affidavit of complaint within 7
judicial days after the date of service. If a tenant files an answer within the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
prescribed period, a hearing is held. If no such answer is filed, sections 2 and 6
authorize the court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the tenant
within a prescribed period under certain circumstances. Sections 7-18 of this bill
make conforming changes relating to the repeal, revision and reorganization of the
procedures for summary eviction.
Existing law requires a court that grants an action for summary eviction for a
default in the payment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency to automatically
seal the eviction case court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 9 removes requirements
relating to the COVID-19 emergency. Section 9 also requires a court to
automatically seal the eviction case court file for an action for summary eviction
brought pursuant to section 2 or 6 under certain circumstances. Section 19 of this
bill makes the amendatory provisions of sections 2-18 applicable to an action for
summary eviction which accrues on or after October 1, 2025.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 283–Assemblymember Carter
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to property; revising provisions relating to
summary evictions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In general, existing law authorizes a landlord who seeks to recover possession
of a premises from a tenant to do so by filing an unlawful detainer action or an
action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542, 40.290-40.420)
Existing law prescribes separate summary eviction procedures for the summary
eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and
who default in the payment of rent; (2) certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful
detainer for reasons other than a default in the payment of rent; and (3) certain
tenants of a commercial premises who default in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253,
40.254, 40.2542)
In general, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require
a landlord to provide certain written notice to a tenant: (1) informing the tenant that
he or she must take certain action or surrender the premises on or before a date
specified in the notice; and (2) advising the tenant of his or her right to contest the
matter by filing an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter. In
so doing, the summary eviction procedures prescribed by existing law require a
tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court concerning an
action for summary eviction before a landlord is required to make any filing
concerning the matter. If such an affidavit is filed, a hearing is held. If no such
affidavit is filed, upon noncompliance of a tenant with the written notice, existing
law authorizes: (1) the landlord to apply by affidavit of complaint for the summary
eviction of the tenant; and (2) the court, without holding a hearing, to order the
removal of the tenant within a prescribed period. (NRS 40.253, 40.254, 40.2542)
Section 20 of this bill repeals the summary eviction procedures prescribed by
existing law for the summary eviction of: (1) certain tenants who are not tenants of
a commercial premises and who default in the payment of rent; and (2) certain
tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default in the
payment of rent. Sections 2-6 of this bill reenact, reorganize and revise these
procedures. Section 2 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
certain tenants who are not tenants of a commercial premises and who default in the
payment of rent. Section 6 establishes a new procedure for the summary eviction of
certain tenants who are guilty of unlawful detainer for reasons other than a default
in the payment of rent.
The new procedures for summary eviction set forth in sections 2 and 6 are
similar to the procedures repealed by section 20 except with regard to: (1) the
required contents of a written notice; (2) certain requirements relating to filings
made with the court; and (3) the period before the removal of a tenant. Instead of
requiring a tenant who contests a summary eviction to file an affidavit in court
before the landlord files a complaint, sections 2 and 6 require the landlord, upon
the expiration of certain notice provided to the tenant, to: (1) apply by affidavit of
complaint for the summary eviction of the tenant; and (2) serve the tenant with a
file-stamped copy of the affidavit of complaint and a copy of the summons.
Sections 2 and 6 additionally require the landlord to file with the court proof of
service of the affidavit, summons and notice within a prescribed period. Sections 2
and 6 require the tenant to file an answer to the affidavit of complaint within 7
judicial days after the date of service. If a tenant files an answer within the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
prescribed period, a hearing is held. If no such answer is filed, sections 2 and 6
authorize the court, without holding a hearing, to order the removal of the tenant
within a prescribed period under certain circumstances. Sections 7-18 of this bill
make conforming changes relating to the repeal, revision and reorganization of the
procedures for summary eviction.
Existing law requires a court that grants an action for summary eviction for a
default in the payment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency to automatically
seal the eviction case court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 9 removes requirements
relating to the COVID-19 emergency. Section 9 also requires a court to
automatically seal the eviction case court file for an action for summary eviction
brought pursuant to section 2 or 6 under certain circumstances. Section 19 of this
bill makes the amendatory provisions of sections 2-18 applicable to an action for
summary eviction which accrues on or after October 1, 2025.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

summary eviction with the court that has jurisdiction over the
matter not later than 7 judicial days after service of the affidavit of

6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, upon being

days after the date of service, file a written answer with the court
that has jurisdiction over the matter. If no written answer is filed

40.253.] section 4 of this act.
3. During the 5-day period following the eviction or lockout of

-
83rd Session (2025)

– 21 –
(a) Has given the tenant notice to surrender the premises
pursuant to [NRS 40.254] section 6 of this act within 90 days after
the owner receives notice of a conviction pursuant to subsection 2 of
NRS 453.305; or
(b) Shows the court that the owner had good cause not to evict
the tenant summarily pursuant to [NRS 40.254,] section 6 of this
act,
 the owner of real property or a mobile home used or intended for
use by a tenant to facilitate any violation of the provisions of NRS
453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except NRS 453.336, is disputably
presumed to have known of and consented to that use if the notices
required by NRS 453.305 have been given in connection with
another such violation relating to the property or mobile home. The
holder of a lien or encumbrance on the property or mobile home is
disputably presumed to have acquired an interest in the property for
fair value and without knowledge or consent to such use, regardless
of when the act giving rise to the forfeiture occurred.
Sec. 17. NRS 453.305 is hereby amended to read as follows:
453.305 1. Whenever a person is arrested for violating any of
the provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except NRS
453.336, and real property or a mobile home occupied by the person
as a tenant has been used to facilitate the violation, the prosecuting
attorney responsible for the case shall cause to be delivered to the
owner of the property or mobile home a written notice of the arrest.
2. Whenever a person is convicted of violating any of the
provisions of NRS 453.011 to 453.552, inclusive, except NRS
453.336, and real property or a mobile home occupied by the person
as a tenant has been used to facilitate the violation, the prosecuting
attorney responsible for the case shall cause to be delivered to the
owner of the property or mobile home a written notice of the
conviction.
3. The notices required by this section must:
(a) Be written in language which is easily understood;
(b) Be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner at the owner’s last known address;
(c) Be sent within 15 days after the arrest occurs or judgment of
conviction is entered against the tenant, as the case may be;
(d) Identify the tenant involved and the offense for which the
tenant has been arrested or convicted; and
(e) Advise the owner that:
(1) The property or mobile home is subject to forfeiture
pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.1205, inclusive, and 453.301
unless the tenant, if convicted, is evicted;
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 22 –
(2) Any similar violation by the same tenant in the future
may also result in the forfeiture of the property unless the tenant has
been evicted;
(3) In any proceeding for forfeiture based upon such a
violation the owner will, by reason of the notice, be deemed to have
known of and consented to the unlawful use of the property or
mobile home; and
(4) The provisions of NRS 40.2514 and [40.254] section 6 of
this act authorize the supplemental remedy of summary eviction to
facilitate the owner’s recovery of the property or mobile home upon
such a violation and provide for the recovery of any reasonable
attorney’s fees the owner incurs in doing so.
4. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude the
commencement of a proceeding for forfeiture or the forfeiture of the
property or mobile home, whether or not the notices required by this
section are given as required, if the proceeding and forfeiture are
otherwise authorized pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.1205,
inclusive, and 453.301.
5. As used in this section, “tenant” means any person entitled
under a written or oral rental agreement to occupy real property or a
mobile home to the exclusion of others.
Sec. 18. NRS 645H.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
645H.520 1. Subject to the provisions of NRS 645H.770, the
services an asset management company may provide include,
without limitation:
(a) Securing real property in foreclosure once it has been
determined to be abandoned and all notice provisions required by
law have been complied with;
(b) Providing maintenance for real property in foreclosure,
including landscape and pool maintenance;
(c) Cleaning the interior or exterior of real property in
foreclosure;
(d) Providing repair or improvements for real property in
foreclosure; and
(e) Removing trash and debris from real property in foreclosure
and the surrounding property.
2. An asset management company may dispose of personal
property abandoned on the premises of a residence in foreclosure or
left on the premises after the eviction of a homeowner or a tenant of
a homeowner without incurring civil or criminal liability in the
following manner:
(a) The asset management company shall reasonably provide for
the safe storage of the property for 30 days after the abandonment or
-

– 23 –
eviction and may charge and collect the reasonable and actual costs
of inventory, moving and storage before releasing the property to
the homeowner or the tenant of the homeowner or his or her
authorized representative rightfully claiming the property within that
period. The asset management company is liable to the homeowner
or the tenant of the homeowner only for the asset management
company’s negligent or wrongful acts in storing the property.
(b) After the expiration of the 30-day period, the asset
management company may dispose of the property and recover his
or her reasonable costs from the property or the value thereof if the
asset management company has made reasonable efforts to locate
the homeowner or the tenant of the homeowner, has notified the
homeowner or the tenant of the homeowner in writing of his or her
intention to dispose of the property and 14 days have elapsed since
the notice was given to the homeowner or the tenant of the
homeowner. The notice must be mailed to the homeowner or the
tenant of the homeowner at the present address of the homeowner or
the tenant of the homeowner and, if that address is unknown, then at
the last known address of the homeowner or the tenant of the
homeowner.
(c) Vehicles must be disposed of in the manner provided in
chapter 487 of NRS for abandoned vehicles.
3. Any dispute relating to the amount of the costs claimed by
the asset management company pursuant to paragraph (a) of
subsection 2 may be resolved using the procedure provided in
[subsection 7 of NRS 40.253.] section 4 of this act.
Sec. 19. The amendatory provisions of sections 2 to 18,
inclusive, of this act apply to an action for summary eviction which
accrues on or after October 1, 2025.
Sec. 20. NRS 40.253 and 40.254 are hereby repealed.
