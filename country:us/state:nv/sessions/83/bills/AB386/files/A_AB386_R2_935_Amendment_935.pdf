EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the assessments
which may be used to assess the literacy of pupils enrolled in an
elementary school; authorizing the Department of Education to
prescribe requirements relating to the collection and reporting of the
results of such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe
the assessments used to assess literacy under certain circumstances;
requiring the Department under certain circumstances to award
grants to school districts and charter schools that use certain
assessments to assess literacy other than the statewide assessment;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
2 charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary
3 school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil in reading
4 during each grade level of elementary school, as is determined to be necessary, by using
5 assessments that have been approved by the State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS
6 388.157) This bill removes the requirement that such assessments be approved by the State
7 Board by regulation, thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the
8 governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any valid and reliable
9 standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading. This bill also authorizes the
10 Department of Education to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing how the results of any
11 assessment used by a school district or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are
12 collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school
13 district or charter school if no assessment is included in the plan. This bill further provides
14 that , if the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school [is
15 responsible for the costs of administering] administers an assessment [used by the school
16 district or charter school] to assess proficiency in reading [,] other than the statewide
17 assessment [.] and the Department establishes a method to determine an equivalent score
18 on such an assessment, the Department is required to award a grant to the school district
19 or local educational agency for the charter school in an amount equal to the savings to
20 the Department, on a proportional basis, for not administering the statewide assessment
21 to pupils in that school district or charter school.

4 enrolled in an elementary school. Such a plan must include, without limitation:
5 (a) A program to provide intervention services and intensive instruction to
6 pupils who have been identified as deficient in the subject area of reading to ensure
7 that those pupils achieve adequate proficiency in the requisite reading skills and
8 reading comprehension skills necessary to perform at a level determined by a
9 statewide assessment to be within a level determined by the State Board , or an
10 equivalent level determined by an assessment administered by the board of
11 trustees of a school district or governing body of a charter school, for a pupil
12 enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is enrolled. Such a program must
13 include, without limitation, regularly scheduled reading sessions in small groups
14 and specific instruction designed to target any area of reading in which the pupil
15 demonstrates a deficiency, including, without limitation, phonological and
16 phonemic awareness, decoding skills, reading fluency and vocabulary and reading
17 comprehension strategies;
18 (b) Procedures for assessing a pupil’s proficiency in the subject area of reading
19 using valid and reliable standards-based assessments [that have been approved by
20 the State Board by regulation] during each grade level of the elementary school at
21 which the pupil is enrolled as determined necessary;
22 (c) A program to improve the proficiency in reading of pupils who are English
23 learners; and
24 (d) Procedures for facilitating collaboration between licensed teachers
25 designated as literacy specialists and classroom teachers.
26 2. The board of trustees of each school district or the governing body of a

35 within the first 45 days of school in a school year.
36 (b) May adopt regulations prescribing the manner by which the board of
37 trustees of each school district and the governing body of a charter school are
38 required to collect and report the results of any assessment used by the school
39 district or charter school, as applicable, to assess a pupil’s proficiency in the
40 subject area of reading.
41 (c) May prescribe one or more valid and reliable standards-based statewide
42 assessments that must be used in a school district or charter school to assess a
43 pupil’s proficiency in the subject area of reading if the board of trustees of the
44 school district or the governing body of the charter school, as applicable, fails to
45 include such an assessment in the plan submitted pursuant to subsection 1.

1 assessment to assess [a pupil’s] the proficiency of a pupil in the subject of reading
2 other than [the] a statewide assessment [shall pay any costs associated with the
3 administration of the assessment, including, without limitation, the costs of the
4 assessment tool and providing training to staff members regarding the use of the
5 assessment tool.] prescribed pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 3 and the
6 Department has established a method to determine an equivalent score to a score
7 on a statewide assessment for such an assessment, the Department shall award a
8 grant to the school district or local educational agency for the charter school in
9 an amount equal to the savings to the Department, on a proportional basis, for
10 not administering the statewide assessment to pupils in the school district or
11 charter school, as applicable. A grant to a school district or local educational
12 agency awarded pursuant to this subsection must not exceed, on a per pupil basis,
13 the cost of a statewide assessment prescribed pursuant to paragraph (c) of
14 subsection 3.
