EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [requiring the State Board of Education to approve
at least two] revising provisions governing the assessments which
may be used to assess the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary
school; authorizing the Department of Education to prescribe
requirements relating to the collection and reporting of the results
of such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe the
assessments used to assess literacy under certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
2 charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary
3 school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil in reading
4 during each grade level of elementary school, as is determined to be necessary, by using
5 assessments that have been approved by the State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS
6 388.157) This bill [requires the State Board to approve by regulation at least two assessments
7 which the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school may
8 administer to pupils to assess proficiency in reading.] removes the requirement that such
9 assessments be approved by the State Board by regulation, thereby allowing the board
10 of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to
11 include in the plan any valid and reliable standards-based assessment to assess
12 proficiency in reading. This bill also authorizes the Department of Education to: (1)
13 adopt regulations prescribing how the results of any assessment used by a school district
14 or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2)
15 prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school district or charter school if no
16 assessment is included in the plan.

1 Section 1. NRS 388.157 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 388.157 1. The board of trustees of each school district and the governing

4 enrolled in an elementary school. Such a plan must include, without limitation:
5 (a) A program to provide intervention services and intensive instruction to
6 pupils who have been identified as deficient in the subject area of reading to ensure
7 that those pupils achieve adequate proficiency in the requisite reading skills and

9 statewide assessment to be within a level determined by the State Board for a pupil
10 enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is enrolled. Such a program must
11 include, without limitation, regularly scheduled reading sessions in small groups
12 and specific instruction designed to target any area of reading in which the pupil
13 demonstrates a deficiency, including, without limitation, phonological and
14 phonemic awareness, decoding skills, reading fluency and vocabulary and reading
15 comprehension strategies;
16 (b) Procedures for assessing a pupil’s proficiency in the subject area of reading
17 using valid and reliable standards-based assessments [that have been approved by
18 the State Board by regulation] during each grade level of the elementary school at

20 (c) A program to improve the proficiency in reading of pupils who are English
21 learners; and
22 (d) Procedures for facilitating collaboration between licensed teachers
23 designated as literacy specialists and classroom teachers.

27 proficiency in the subject area of reading.
28 3.] The board of trustees of each school district or the governing body of a
29 charter school, as applicable, shall:
30 (a) Submit its plan to the Department for approval on or before the date
31 prescribed by the Department on a form prescribed by the Department; and
32 (b) Make such revisions to the plan as the Department determines are
33 necessary.
34 3. [4.] The Department [shall] :
35 (a) Shall adopt regulations that prescribe procedures for assessing the

37 within the first 45 days of school in a school year.
38 (b) May adopt regulations prescribing the manner by which the board of
39 trustees of each school district and the governing body of a charter school are
40 required to collect and report the results of any assessment used by the school
41 district or charter school, as applicable, to assess a pupil’s proficiency in the
42 subject area of reading.
43 (c) May prescribe valid and reliable standards-based assessments that must
44 be used in a school district or charter school to assess a pupil’s proficiency in the
45 subject area of reading if the board of trustees of the school district or the
46 governing body of the charter school, as applicable, fails to include such an
47 assessment in the plan submitted pursuant to subsection 1.
