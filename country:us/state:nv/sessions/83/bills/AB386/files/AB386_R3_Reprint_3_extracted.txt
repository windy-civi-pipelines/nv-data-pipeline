SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to assessments
administered to pupils to assess reading proficiency.
(BDR 34-828)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
assessments which may be used to assess the literacy of
pupils enrolled in an elementary school; authorizing the
Department of Education to prescribe requirements
relating to the collection and reporting of the results of
such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe
the assessments used to assess literacy under certain
circumstances; requiring the Department under certain
circumstances to award grants to school districts and
charter schools that use certain assessments to assess
literacy other than the statewide assessment; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
2 body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
3 in an elementary school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the
4 proficiency of a pupil in reading during each grade level of elementary school, as is
5 determined to be necessary, by using assessments that have been approved by the
6 State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS 388.157) This bill removes the
7 requirement that such assessments be approved by the State Board by regulation,
8 thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
9 a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any valid and reliable
10 standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading. This bill also
11 authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing how
12 the results of any assessment used by a school district or charter school to assess
13 proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the assessments

14 which must be used in a school district or charter school if no assessment is
15 included in the plan. This bill further provides that, if the board of trustees of a
16 school district or the governing body of a charter school administers an assessment
17 to assess proficiency in reading other than the statewide assessment and the
18 Department establishes a method to determine an equivalent score on such an
19 assessment, the Department is required to award a grant to the school district or
20 local educational agency for the charter school in an amount equal to the savings to
21 the Department, on a proportional basis, for not administering the statewide
22 assessment to pupils in that school district or charter school.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 388.157 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 388.157 1. The board of trustees of each school district and
3 the governing body of each charter school shall prepare a plan to
4 improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary school.
5 Such a plan must include, without limitation:
6 (a) A program to provide intervention services and intensive
7 instruction to pupils who have been identified as deficient in the
8 subject area of reading to ensure that those pupils achieve adequate
9 proficiency in the requisite reading skills and reading
10 comprehension skills necessary to perform at a level determined by
11 a statewide assessment to be within a level determined by the State
12 Board , or an equivalent level determined by an assessment
13 administered by the board of trustees of a school district or
14 governing body of a charter school, for a pupil enrolled in the same
15 grade in which the pupil is enrolled. Such a program must include,
16 without limitation, regularly scheduled reading sessions in small
17 groups and specific instruction designed to target any area of
18 reading in which the pupil demonstrates a deficiency, including,
19 without limitation, phonological and phonemic awareness, decoding
20 skills, reading fluency and vocabulary and reading comprehension
21 strategies;
22 (b) Procedures for assessing a pupil’s proficiency in the subject
23 area of reading using valid and reliable standards-based assessments
24 [that have been approved by the State Board by regulation] during
25 each grade level of the elementary school at which the pupil is
26 enrolled as determined necessary;
27 (c) A program to improve the proficiency in reading of pupils
28 who are English learners; and
29 (d) Procedures for facilitating collaboration between licensed
30 teachers designated as literacy specialists and classroom teachers.
31 2. The board of trustees of each school district or the governing
32 body of a charter school, as applicable, shall:
-

1 (a) Submit its plan to the Department for approval on or before
2 the date prescribed by the Department on a form prescribed by the
3 Department; and
4 (b) Make such revisions to the plan as the Department
5 determines are necessary.
6 3. The Department [shall] :
7 (a) Shall adopt regulations that prescribe procedures for
8 assessing the development across early learning domains of a pupil
9 enrolled in kindergarten within the first 45 days of school in a
10 school year.
11 (b) May adopt regulations prescribing the manner by which
12 the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
13 body of a charter school are required to collect and report the
14 results of any assessment used by the school district or charter
15 school, as applicable, to assess a pupil’s proficiency in the subject
16 area of reading.
17 (c) May prescribe one or more valid and reliable standards-
18 based statewide assessments that must be used in a school district
19 or charter school to assess a pupil’s proficiency in the subject area
20 of reading if the board of trustees of the school district or the
21 governing body of the charter school, as applicable, fails to
22 include such an assessment in the plan submitted pursuant to
23 subsection 1.
24 4. If the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
25 body of a charter school administers an assessment to assess the
26 proficiency of a pupil in the subject of reading other than a
27 statewide assessment prescribed pursuant to paragraph (c) of
28 subsection 3 and the Department has established a method to
29 determine an equivalent score to a score on a statewide assessment
30 for such an assessment, the Department shall award a grant to the
31 school district or local educational agency for the charter school
32 in an amount equal to the savings to the Department, on a
33 proportional basis, for not administering the statewide assessment
34 to pupils in the school district or charter school, as applicable. A
35 grant to a school district or local educational agency awarded
36 pursuant to this subsection must not exceed, on a per pupil basis,
37 the cost of a statewide assessment prescribed pursuant to
38 paragraph (c) of subsection 3.
