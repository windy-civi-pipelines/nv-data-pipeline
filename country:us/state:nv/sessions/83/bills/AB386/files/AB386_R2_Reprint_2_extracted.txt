EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
assessments which may be used to assess the literacy of
pupils enrolled in an elementary school; authorizing the
Department of Education to prescribe requirements
relating to the collection and reporting of the results of
such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe
the assessments used to assess literacy under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
2 body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
3 in an elementary school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the
4 proficiency of a pupil in reading during each grade level of elementary school, as is
5 determined to be necessary, by using assessments that have been approved by the
6 State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS 388.157) This bill removes the
7 requirement that such assessments be approved by the State Board by regulation,
8 thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
9 a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any valid and reliable
10 standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading. This bill also
11 authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing how
12 the results of any assessment used by a school district or charter school to assess
13 proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the assessments
14 which must be used in a school district or charter school if no assessment is
15 included in the plan. This bill further provides that the board of trustees of a school
16 district or the governing body of a charter school is responsible for the costs of

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 388.157 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 388.157 1. The board of trustees of each school district and
3 the governing body of each charter school shall prepare a plan to
4 improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary school.

10 comprehension skills necessary to perform at a level determined by
11 a statewide assessment to be within a level determined by the State
12 Board for a pupil enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is
13 enrolled. Such a program must include, without limitation, regularly
14 scheduled reading sessions in small groups and specific instruction
15 designed to target any area of reading in which the pupil
16 demonstrates a deficiency, including, without limitation,
17 phonological and phonemic awareness, decoding skills, reading
18 fluency and vocabulary and reading comprehension strategies;
19 (b) Procedures for assessing a pupil’s proficiency in the subject
20 area of reading using valid and reliable standards-based assessments
21 [that have been approved by the State Board by regulation] during
22 each grade level of the elementary school at which the pupil is
23 enrolled as determined necessary;
24 (c) A program to improve the proficiency in reading of pupils
25 who are English learners; and
26 (d) Procedures for facilitating collaboration between licensed
27 teachers designated as literacy specialists and classroom teachers.
28 2. The board of trustees of each school district or the governing
29 body of a charter school, as applicable, shall:
30 (a) Submit its plan to the Department for approval on or before
31 the date prescribed by the Department on a form prescribed by the
32 Department; and
33 (b) Make such revisions to the plan as the Department
34 determines are necessary.
35 3. The Department [shall] :
36 (a) Shall adopt regulations that prescribe procedures for
37 assessing the development across early learning domains of a pupil
38 enrolled in kindergarten within the first 45 days of school in a
39 school year.

10 if the board of trustees of the school district or the governing body
11 of the charter school, as applicable, fails to include such an
12 assessment in the plan submitted pursuant to subsection 1.
13 4. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing
14 body of a charter school, as applicable, that elects to administer
