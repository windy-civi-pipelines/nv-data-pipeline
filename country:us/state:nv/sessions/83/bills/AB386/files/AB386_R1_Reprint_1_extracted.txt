SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to assessments

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
assessments which may be used to assess the literacy of
pupils enrolled in an elementary school; authorizing the
Department of Education to prescribe requirements
relating to the collection and reporting of the results of
such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe
the assessments used to assess literacy under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
2 body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
3 in an elementary school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the
4 proficiency of a pupil in reading during each grade level of elementary school, as is
5 determined to be necessary, by using assessments that have been approved by the
6 State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS 388.157) This bill removes the
7 requirement that such assessments be approved by the State Board by regulation,
8 thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
9 a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any valid and reliable
10 standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading. This bill also
11 authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing how
12 the results of any assessment used by a school district or charter school to assess
13 proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the assessments
14 which must be used in a school district or charter school if no assessment is
15 included in the plan.
