AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the Board of Trustees of
the Washoe County School District to establish and
administer a pilot program during the 2025-2026 school
year to use an alternative assessment to assess the literacy
of pupils enrolled in an elementary school if the
alternative assessment satisfies certain criteria; requiring
the Department of Education to award a grant to the
Washoe County School District in an amount equal to
the savings to the Department for not administering the
statewide assessment to pupils enrolled in the School
District; requiring a report concerning the program to be
submitted to the Department and the Joint Interim
Standing Committee on Education; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
2 body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
3 in an elementary school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the
4 proficiency of a pupil in reading during each grade level of elementary school, as is
5 determined to be necessary, by using assessments that have been approved by the
6 State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS 388.157) This bill authorizes the
7 Board of Trustees of the Washoe County School District to establish and administer
8 a pilot program during the 2025-2026 school year to administer an assessment other
9 than the statewide assessment to assess the proficiency of pupils in reading if the
10 State Board approves the assessment. Under this bill, the State Board is required to
11 approve such an assessment if the assessment is a valid and reliable

12 standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading and the Department of
13 Education has established a method to establish an equivalent score to a score on
14 the statewide assessment. This bill further provides that, if the Board of Trustees of
15 the Washoe County School District administers such an assessment to assess
16 proficiency in reading other than the statewide assessment, the Department is
17 required to award a grant to the School District in an amount equal to the savings to
18 the Department for not administering the statewide assessment to pupils in the
19 School District. Finally, this bill requires the Washoe County School District to
20 submit a report to the Department and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
21 Education concerning the pilot program.
