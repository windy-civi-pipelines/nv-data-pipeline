EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the assessments
which may be used to assess the literacy of pupils enrolled in an
elementary school; authorizing the Department of Education to
prescribe requirements relating to the collection and reporting of the
results of such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe
the assessments used to assess literacy under certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
2 charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary
3 school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil in reading
4 during each grade level of elementary school, as is determined to be necessary, by using
5 assessments that have been approved by the State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS
6 388.157) This bill removes the requirement that such assessments be approved by the State
7 Board by regulation, thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the
8 governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any valid and reliable
9 standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading. This bill also authorizes the
10 Department of Education to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing how the results of any
11 assessment used by a school district or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are
12 collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school
13 district or charter school if no assessment is included in the plan. This bill further provides
14 that the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school is
15 responsible for the costs of administering an assessment used by the school district or
16 charter school to assess proficiency in reading, other than the statewide assessment.

4 enrolled in an elementary school. Such a plan must include, without limitation:
5 (a) A program to provide intervention services and intensive instruction to
6 pupils who have been identified as deficient in the subject area of reading to ensure
7 that those pupils achieve adequate proficiency in the requisite reading skills and

10 enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is enrolled. Such a program must
11 include, without limitation, regularly scheduled reading sessions in small groups
12 and specific instruction designed to target any area of reading in which the pupil
13 demonstrates a deficiency, including, without limitation, phonological and
14 phonemic awareness, decoding skills, reading fluency and vocabulary and reading
15 comprehension strategies;
16 (b) Procedures for assessing a pupil’s proficiency in the subject area of reading
17 using valid and reliable standards-based assessments [that have been approved by

35 trustees of each school district and the governing body of a charter school are

38 subject area of reading.
39 (c) May prescribe valid and reliable standards-based assessments that must
40 be used in a school district or charter school to assess a pupil’s proficiency in the
41 subject area of reading if the board of trustees of the school district or the
42 governing body of the charter school, as applicable, fails to include such an
43 assessment in the plan submitted pursuant to subsection 1.
44 4. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
45 charter school, as applicable, that elects to administer any assessment to assess a
46 pupil’s proficiency in the subject of reading other than the statewide assessment
47 shall pay any costs associated with the administration of the assessment,
48 including, without limitation, the costs of the assessment tool and providing
49 training to staff members regarding the use of the assessment tool.
