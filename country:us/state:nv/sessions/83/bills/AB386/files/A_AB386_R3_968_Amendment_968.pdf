AN ACT relating to education; [revising provisions governing the assessments
which may be used] authorizing the Board of Trustees of the
Washoe County School District to establish and administer a pilot
program during the 2025-2026 school year to use an alternative
assessment to assess the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary
school [; authorizing] if the alternative assessment satisfies certain
criteria; requiring the Department of Education to [prescribe
requirements relating to the collection and reporting of the results of
such assessments; authorizing the Department to prescribe the
assessments used to assess literacy under certain circumstances;
requiring the Department under certain circumstances to award grants
to school districts and charter schools that use certain assessments to
assess literacy other than the statewide assessment;] award a grant to
the Washoe County School District in an amount equal to the
savings to the Department for not administering the statewide
assessment to pupils enrolled in the School District; requiring a
report concerning the program to be submitted to the Department
and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
2 charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an elementary
3 school. Such a plan must include procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil in reading
4 during each grade level of elementary school, as is determined to be necessary, by using
5 assessments that have been approved by the State Board of Education by regulation. (NRS
6 388.157) This bill [removes the requirement that such assessments be approved by the State
7 Board by regulation, thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the
8 governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any] authorizes the
9 Board of Trustees of the Washoe County School District to establish and administer a
10 pilot program during the 2025-2026 school year to administer an assessment other than

Senate Amendment No. 968 to Assembly Bill No. 386 Third Reprint Page 4
11 the statewide assessment to assess the proficiency of pupils in reading if the State Board
12 approves the assessment. Under this bill, the State Board is required to approve such an
13 assessment if the assessment is a valid and reliable standards-based assessment to assess
14 proficiency in reading [. This bill also authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt
15 regulations prescribing how the results of any assessment used by a school district or charter
16 school to assess proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the
17 assessments which must be used in a school district or charter school if no assessment is
18 included in the plan.] and the Department of Education has established a method to
19 establish an equivalent score to a score on the statewide assessment. This bill further
20 provides that, if the [board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter
21 school] Board of Trustees of the Washoe County School District administers such an
22 assessment to assess proficiency in reading other than the statewide assessment , [and the
23 Department establishes a method to determine an equivalent score on such an assessment,] the
24 Department is required to award a grant to the [school district or local educational agency for
25 the charter school] School District in an amount equal to the savings to the Department [, on a
26 proportional basis,] for not administering the statewide assessment to pupils in [that school
27 district or charter school.] the School District. Finally, this bill requires the Washoe
28 County School District to submit a report to the Department and the Joint Interim
29 Standing Committee on Education concerning the pilot program.

12 enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is enrolled. Such a program must
13 include, without limitation, regularly scheduled reading sessions in small groups
14 and specific instruction designed to target any area of reading in which the pupil
15 demonstrates a deficiency, including, without limitation, phonological and
16 phonemic awareness, decoding skills, reading fluency and vocabulary and reading
