EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; providing for the development,
review and updating of athletic emergency action plans
for use by public and private high schools in responding
to serious or life-threatening injuries sustained by pupils
participating in certain school athletic activities;
establishing requirements for certain training and
certification for coaches, managers and other persons
associated with such school athletic activities;
establishing requirements for maintaining an automated
external defibrillator at each public or private high school
in this State for use during the school day or during
certain school athletic activities; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark County School District and
3 Washoe County School District) to provide at least one automated external
4 defibrillator at each high school within the school district. (NRS 450B.600)
5 Existing law additionally authorizes: (1) the board of trustees of each school district
6 in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to provide an automated external
7 defibrillator in each school in the school district, other than a high school, and at
8 each athletic facility maintained by the school district that is in a separate location
9 from a public school; and (2) the board of trustees of any other school district to
10 provide an automated external defibrillator in each school in the school district and
11 at each athletic facility maintained by the school district that is in a separate
-

– 2 –
12 location from a public school. (NRS 450B.620) Section 6 of this bill: (1) extends to
13 all public and private high schools in this State the requirement to maintain an
14 automated external defibrillator and requires an automated external defibrillator to
15 be accessible during the school day and during all school athletic activities; and (2)
16 requires each coach, manager or other person who is associated with such a school
17 athletic activity to complete training in the operation and use of an automated
18 external defibrillator. Under section 6, a school athletic activity is: (1) an
19 interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
20 Association or any other interscholastic athletic activity or event involving an
21 organized athletic game or competition against another team, club or entity; or (2)
22 any practice or preparation for any such interscholastic activity or event. Section 7
23 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the requirement to maintain
24 an automated external defibrillator is extended to all public and private high
25 schools.
26 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill require the establishment of athletic emergency
27 action plans for use by public and private high schools in responding to serious or
28 life-threatening injuries sustained by pupils participating in school athletic
29 activities. Under section 2, the board of trustees of each school district and the
30 governing body of each charter school is required to develop a model for such a
31 plan and provide the model to each principal of a high school or charter high
32 school. Section 2 requires the principal of each high school or charter high school
33 to use the model to develop a site-specific plan for the high school or charter high
34 school, as applicable, that satisfies certain minimum requirements, including,
35 without limitation: (1) identifying the personnel in each school who are responsible
36 for carrying out the plan; (2) identifying providers of health care who may provide
37 medical care during the activities; (3) identifying equipment and supplies that may
38 be needed to respond to a medical emergency at such activities; (4) describing
39 procedures to be followed after a serious or life-threatening injury; and (5)
40 providing contact information for emergency medical services and directions to
41 assist emergency medical personnel in accessing the location of the activity.
42 Finally, section 2 requires each coach, manager or other person who is associated
43 with a school athletic activity to attend training on the athletic emergency action
44 plan for his or her school, which must include, without limitation, a rehearsal of
45 actions required under the plan to respond to a serious or life-threatening injury to a
46 pupil participating in a school athletic activity. Section 4 requires the governing
47 body of a private school that operates as a high school to develop an athletic
48 emergency action plan for the school and imposes the same requirements related to
49 such a plan as are set forth in section 2 for public schools.
50 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
51 plan for teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who
52 teach or supervise pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in
53 the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Existing
54 regulations require coaches of a school team participating in an interscholastic
55 activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to
56 be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to complete certain training in
57 administering first aid. (NAC 385B.798) Section 1 of this bill requires each coach,
58 manager or other person who is associated with any school athletic activity in a
59 school district to obtain training and certification in the administration of
60 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this requirement to
61 each coach, manager or person who is associated with any school athletic activity
62 or event at a private school.
