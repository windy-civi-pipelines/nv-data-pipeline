8 administering first aid. (NAC 385B.798) Section 1.5 of this bill requires each
9 coach, manager or athletic trainer in a school district to obtain training and

11 this bill applies this requirement to each coach, manager or athletic trainer at a
12 private school.
13 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing
14 body of each charter school and the governing body of each private school to
15 establish an emergency operations plan development committee to develop a plan
