AN ACT relating to education; requiring an emergency operations plan
development committee for public and private schools to create a plan
for responding to certain medical emergencies relating to the heart;
authorizing the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
body of a charter school or the governing body of a private school to

requiring the governing body of a charter school to establish a
plan for certain personnel to obtain training and certification in
the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; establishing
requirements for certain training and certification for coaches,
managers and athletic trainers; and providing other matters properly

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a plan for
2 teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who teach or supervise
3 pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in the administration of
4 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Section 1.5 of this bill additionally requires
5 the governing body of a charter school to establish such a plan. Section 1.4 of this bill
6 makes a conforming change to indicate the applicability of that requirement to charter
7 schools.
8 Existing regulations require coaches of a school team participating in an interscholastic
9 activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to be certified
10 in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to complete certain training in administering first aid.
11 (NAC 385B.798) Section 1.5 [of this bill] requires each coach, manager or athletic trainer in a
12 school district or at a charter school who is not a pupil to obtain training and certification in
13 the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this
Senate Amendment No. 614 to Assembly Bill No. 454 First Reprint Page 4
14 requirement to each coach, manager or athletic trainer at a private school [.] who is not a
15 pupil.
16 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing body of
17 each charter school and the governing body of each private school to establish an emergency
18 operations plan development committee to develop a plan for responding to certain
19 emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243, 394.1685, 394.1687) Sections 1.3 and
20 8.7 of this bill require a plan developed by such a committee for a public school or private
21 school, respectively, to include a plan for immediately responding to an emergency involving
22 the heart, including, without limitation, a person in cardiac arrest. Sections 1 and 8.3 of this
23 bill provide that the membership of such a committee at a public school or private school,
24 respectively, may include a [physician or other medical professional.] provider of health
25 care who has specific skills, training and experience in responding to medical
26 emergencies involving the heart.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring an emergency operations plan
development committee for public and private schools to create a plan
for responding to certain medical emergencies relating to the heart;
authorizing the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
body of a charter school or the governing body of a private school to
include [a physician or other medical professional] certain providers
of health care as [a member] members of such a committee;
requiring the governing body of a charter school to establish a
plan for certain personnel to obtain training and certification in
the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; establishing
requirements for certain training and certification for coaches,
managers and athletic trainers; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a plan for
2 teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who teach or supervise
3 pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in the administration of
4 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Section 1.5 of this bill additionally requires
5 the governing body of a charter school to establish such a plan. Section 1.4 of this bill
6 makes a conforming change to indicate the applicability of that requirement to charter
7 schools.
8 Existing regulations require coaches of a school team participating in an interscholastic
9 activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to be certified
10 in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to complete certain training in administering first aid.
11 (NAC 385B.798) Section 1.5 [of this bill] requires each coach, manager or athletic trainer in a
12 school district or at a charter school who is not a pupil to obtain training and certification in
13 the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this

Senate Amendment No. 614 to Assembly Bill No. 454 First Reprint Page 4
14 requirement to each coach, manager or athletic trainer at a private school [.] who is not a
15 pupil.
16 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing body of
17 each charter school and the governing body of each private school to establish an emergency
18 operations plan development committee to develop a plan for responding to certain
19 emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243, 394.1685, 394.1687) Sections 1.3 and
20 8.7 of this bill require a plan developed by such a committee for a public school or private
21 school, respectively, to include a plan for immediately responding to an emergency involving
22 the heart, including, without limitation, a person in cardiac arrest. Sections 1 and 8.3 of this
23 bill provide that the membership of such a committee at a public school or private school,
24 respectively, may include a [physician or other medical professional.] provider of health
25 care who has specific skills, training and experience in responding to medical
26 emergencies involving the heart.
