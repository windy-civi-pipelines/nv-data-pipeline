CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; requiring an emergency operations
plan development committee for public and private schools to
create a plan for responding to certain medical emergencies
relating to the heart; authorizing the board of trustees of a
school district, the governing body of a charter school or the
governing body of a private school to include certain
providers of health care as members of such a committee;
requiring the governing body of a charter school to establish
a plan for certain personnel to obtain training and
certification in the administration of cardiopulmonary
resuscitation; establishing requirements for certain training
and certification for coaches, managers and athletic trainers;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
plan for teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who
teach or supervise pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in
the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Section 1.5 of
this bill additionally requires the governing body of a charter school to establish
such a plan. Section 1.4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the
applicability of that requirement to charter schools.
Existing regulations require coaches of a school team participating in an
interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
Association to be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to complete certain
training in administering first aid. (NAC 385B.798) Section 1.5 requires each
coach, manager or athletic trainer in a school district or at a charter school who is
not a pupil to obtain training and certification in the administration of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this requirement to
each coach, manager or athletic trainer at a private school who is not a pupil.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing
body of each charter school and the governing body of each private school to
establish an emergency operations plan development committee to develop a plan
for responding to certain emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243,
394.1685, 394.1687) Sections 1.3 and 8.7 of this bill require a plan developed by
such a committee for a public school or private school, respectively, to include a
plan for immediately responding to an emergency involving the heart, including,
without limitation, a person in cardiac arrest. Sections 1 and 8.3 of this bill provide
that the membership of such a committee at a public school or private school,
respectively, may include a provider of health care who has specific skills, training
and experience in responding to medical emergencies involving the heart.
