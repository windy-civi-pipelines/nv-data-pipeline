EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [providing for the development, review and
updating of athletic] requiring an emergency [action plans]
operations plan development committee for [use by] public and
private [high] schools [in responding to serious or life-threatening
injuries sustained by pupils participating in certain school athletic
activities;] to create a plan for responding to certain medical
emergencies relating to the heart; authorizing the board of trustees
of a school district, the governing body of a charter school or the
governing body of a private school to include a physician or other
medical professional as a member of such a committee; establishing
requirements for certain training and certification for coaches,
managers and [other persons associated with such school athletic
activities; establishing requirements for maintaining an automated
external defibrillator at each public or private high school in this State
for use during the school day or during certain school athletic
activities;] athletic trainers; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark County School District and Washoe County
3 School District) to provide at least one automated external defibrillator at each high school
4 within the school district. (NRS 450B.600) Existing law additionally authorizes: (1) the board
5 of trustees of each school district in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to provide
6 an automated external defibrillator in each school in the school district, other than a high
7 school, and at each athletic facility maintained by the school district that is in a separate
8 location from a public school; and (2) the board of trustees of any other school district to
9 provide an automated external defibrillator in each school in the school district and at each
Assembly Amendment No. 390 to Assembly Bill No. 454 Page 4
10 athletic facility maintained by the school district that is in a separate location from a public
11 school. (NRS 450B.620) Section 6 of this bill: (1) extends to all public and private high
12 schools in this State the requirement to maintain an automated external defibrillator and
13 requires an automated external defibrillator to be accessible during the school day and during
14 all school athletic activities; and (2) requires each coach, manager or other person who is
15 associated with such a school athletic activity to complete training in the operation and use of
16 an automated external defibrillator. Under section 6, a school athletic activity is: (1) an
17 interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association
18 or any other interscholastic athletic activity or event involving an organized athletic game or
19 competition against another team, club or entity; or (2) any practice or preparation for any
20 such interscholastic activity or event. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
21 reflect that the requirement to maintain an automated external defibrillator is extended to all
22 public and private high schools.
23 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill require the establishment of athletic emergency action plans
24 for use by public and private high schools in responding to serious or life-threatening injuries
25 sustained by pupils participating in school athletic activities. Under section 2, the board of
26 trustees of each school district and the governing body of each charter school is required to
27 develop a model for such a plan and provide the model to each principal of a high school or
28 charter high school. Section 2 requires the principal of each high school or charter high school
29 to use the model to develop a site-specific plan for the high school or charter high school, as
30 applicable, that satisfies certain minimum requirements, including, without limitation: (1)
31 identifying the personnel in each school who are responsible for carrying out the plan; (2)
32 identifying providers of health care who may provide medical care during the activities; (3)
33 identifying equipment and supplies that may be needed to respond to a medical emergency at
34 such activities; (4) describing procedures to be followed after a serious or life-threatening
35 injury; and (5) providing contact information for emergency medical services and directions to
36 assist emergency medical personnel in accessing the location of the activity. Finally, section 2
37 requires each coach, manager or other person who is associated with a school athletic activity
38 to attend training on the athletic emergency action plan for his or her school, which must
39 include, without limitation, a rehearsal of actions required under the plan to respond to a
40 serious or life-threatening injury to a pupil participating in a school athletic activity. Section 4
41 requires the governing body of a private school that operates as a high school to develop an
42 athletic emergency action plan for the school and imposes the same requirements related to
43 such a plan as are set forth in section 2 for public schools.]
44 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a plan for
45 teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who teach or supervise
46 pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in the administration of
47 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Existing regulations require coaches of a
48 school team participating in an interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada
49 Interscholastic Activities Association to be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to
50 complete certain training in administering first aid. (NAC 385B.798) Section [1] 1.5 of this
51 bill requires each coach, manager or [other person who is associated with any school athletic
52 activity] athletic trainer in a school district to obtain training and certification in the
53 administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this requirement
54 to each coach, manager or [person who is associated with any school athletic activity or event]
55 athletic trainer at a private school.
56 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing
57 body of each charter school and the governing body of each private school to establish
58 an emergency operations plan development committee to develop a plan for responding
59 to certain emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243, 394.1685, 394.1687)
60 Sections 1.3 and 8.7 of this bill require a plan developed by such a committee for a public
61 school or private school, respectively, to include a plan for immediately responding to an
62 emergency involving the heart, including, without limitation, a person in cardiac arrest.
63 Sections 1 and 8.3 of this bill provide that the membership of such a committee at a
64 public school or private school, respectively, may include a physician or other medical
65 professional.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [providing for the development, review and
updating of athletic] requiring an emergency [action plans]
operations plan development committee for [use by] public and
private [high] schools [in responding to serious or life-threatening
injuries sustained by pupils participating in certain school athletic
activities;] to create a plan for responding to certain medical
emergencies relating to the heart; authorizing the board of trustees
of a school district, the governing body of a charter school or the
governing body of a private school to include a physician or other
medical professional as a member of such a committee; establishing
requirements for certain training and certification for coaches,
managers and [other persons associated with such school athletic
activities; establishing requirements for maintaining an automated
external defibrillator at each public or private high school in this State
for use during the school day or during certain school athletic
activities;] athletic trainers; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark County School District and Washoe County
3 School District) to provide at least one automated external defibrillator at each high school
4 within the school district. (NRS 450B.600) Existing law additionally authorizes: (1) the board
5 of trustees of each school district in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to provide
6 an automated external defibrillator in each school in the school district, other than a high
7 school, and at each athletic facility maintained by the school district that is in a separate
8 location from a public school; and (2) the board of trustees of any other school district to
9 provide an automated external defibrillator in each school in the school district and at each

Assembly Amendment No. 390 to Assembly Bill No. 454 Page 4
10 athletic facility maintained by the school district that is in a separate location from a public
11 school. (NRS 450B.620) Section 6 of this bill: (1) extends to all public and private high
12 schools in this State the requirement to maintain an automated external defibrillator and
13 requires an automated external defibrillator to be accessible during the school day and during
14 all school athletic activities; and (2) requires each coach, manager or other person who is
15 associated with such a school athletic activity to complete training in the operation and use of
16 an automated external defibrillator. Under section 6, a school athletic activity is: (1) an
17 interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association
18 or any other interscholastic athletic activity or event involving an organized athletic game or
19 competition against another team, club or entity; or (2) any practice or preparation for any
20 such interscholastic activity or event. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
21 reflect that the requirement to maintain an automated external defibrillator is extended to all
22 public and private high schools.
23 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill require the establishment of athletic emergency action plans
24 for use by public and private high schools in responding to serious or life-threatening injuries
25 sustained by pupils participating in school athletic activities. Under section 2, the board of
26 trustees of each school district and the governing body of each charter school is required to
27 develop a model for such a plan and provide the model to each principal of a high school or
28 charter high school. Section 2 requires the principal of each high school or charter high school
29 to use the model to develop a site-specific plan for the high school or charter high school, as
30 applicable, that satisfies certain minimum requirements, including, without limitation: (1)
31 identifying the personnel in each school who are responsible for carrying out the plan; (2)
32 identifying providers of health care who may provide medical care during the activities; (3)
33 identifying equipment and supplies that may be needed to respond to a medical emergency at
34 such activities; (4) describing procedures to be followed after a serious or life-threatening
35 injury; and (5) providing contact information for emergency medical services and directions to
36 assist emergency medical personnel in accessing the location of the activity. Finally, section 2
37 requires each coach, manager or other person who is associated with a school athletic activity
38 to attend training on the athletic emergency action plan for his or her school, which must
39 include, without limitation, a rehearsal of actions required under the plan to respond to a
40 serious or life-threatening injury to a pupil participating in a school athletic activity. Section 4
41 requires the governing body of a private school that operates as a high school to develop an
42 athletic emergency action plan for the school and imposes the same requirements related to
43 such a plan as are set forth in section 2 for public schools.]
44 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a plan for
45 teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who teach or supervise
46 pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in the administration of
47 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Existing regulations require coaches of a
48 school team participating in an interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada
49 Interscholastic Activities Association to be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to
50 complete certain training in administering first aid. (NAC 385B.798) Section [1] 1.5 of this
51 bill requires each coach, manager or [other person who is associated with any school athletic
52 activity] athletic trainer in a school district to obtain training and certification in the
53 administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this requirement
54 to each coach, manager or [person who is associated with any school athletic activity or event]
55 athletic trainer at a private school.
56 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing
57 body of each charter school and the governing body of each private school to establish
58 an emergency operations plan development committee to develop a plan for responding
59 to certain emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243, 394.1685, 394.1687)
60 Sections 1.3 and 8.7 of this bill require a plan developed by such a committee for a public
61 school or private school, respectively, to include a plan for immediately responding to an
62 emergency involving the heart, including, without limitation, a person in cardiac arrest.
63 Sections 1 and 8.3 of this bill provide that the membership of such a committee at a
64 public school or private school, respectively, may include a physician or other medical
65 professional.
