AN ACT relating to education; requiring an emergency operations
plan development committee for public and private
schools to create a plan for responding to certain medical
emergencies relating to the heart; authorizing the board of
trustees of a school district, the governing body of a

cardiopulmonary resuscitation; establishing requirements
for certain training and certification for coaches,

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
2 plan for teachers and other licensed educational personnel in the school district who
3 teach or supervise pupils in physical education to obtain training and certification in
4 the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. (NRS 391.092) Section 1.5 of
5 this bill additionally requires the governing body of a charter school to establish
6 such a plan. Section 1.4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the
7 applicability of that requirement to charter schools.
8 Existing regulations require coaches of a school team participating in an
9 interscholastic activity or event governed by the Nevada Interscholastic Activities

12 coach, manager or athletic trainer in a school district or at a charter school who is
13 not a pupil to obtain training and certification in the administration of
14 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Section 5 of this bill applies this requirement to
15 each coach, manager or athletic trainer at a private school who is not a pupil.
16 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district, the governing
17 body of each charter school and the governing body of each private school to
18 establish an emergency operations plan development committee to develop a plan
19 for responding to certain emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243,
20 394.1685, 394.1687) Sections 1.3 and 8.7 of this bill require a plan developed by
21 such a committee for a public school or private school, respectively, to include a
22 plan for immediately responding to an emergency involving the heart, including,
23 without limitation, a person in cardiac arrest. Sections 1 and 8.3 of this bill provide
