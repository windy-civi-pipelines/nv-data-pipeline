Senate Bill No. 171–Senators Ohrenschall and Scheible
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting health care licensing
boards from disqualifying from licensure or disciplining a
person for providing or assisting in the provision of
medically necessary gender-affirming health care services;
prohibiting in certain circumstances the Governor from
extraditing a person who is charged with a crime in another
state related to medically necessary gender-affirming health
care services; prohibiting state agencies from assisting in
certain investigations and proceedings initiated in other states
related to medically necessary gender-affirming health care
services; requiring certain health care licensing boards to
examine the feasibility of reciprocal licensure for health care
providers who provide gender-affirming health care services
in other states; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law regulates the licensing, certification and registration of various
providers of health care in this State. (Chapters 630-637B and 639-641D of NRS)
Existing law prohibits a health care licensing board from disqualifying from
licensure or subjecting a person to discipline solely: (1) for providing reproductive
health care services that are lawful and consistent with the practice of the relevant
profession in this State; or (2) as a consequence of certain adverse actions
threatened or imposed in another jurisdiction for the provision of such reproductive
health care services. (NRS 629.250) Section 1 of this bill additionally prohibits a
health care licensing board from taking similar actions against a person for
providing or assisting in the provision of medically necessary gender-affirming
health care services that are lawful in this State. Section 4 of this bill requires each
health care licensing board that licenses providers of health care who provide
gender-affirming health care services to examine the feasibility of providing
reciprocal licensing to providers of health care in other states to facilitate the
provision of gender-affirming health care services to persons from other states who
seek such medically necessary services in this State.
In accordance with the Extradition Clause of Section 2 of Article IV of the
United States Constitution, existing state law requires the Governor to extradite to
another state any person charged in that state with a crime, who is found in this
State. (NRS 179.181) Under existing law, the Governor is also authorized, but not
required, to extradite to another state any person in this State charged in the other
state with committing an act in this State intentionally resulting in a crime in the
state demanding extradition. (NRS 179.189) Existing law, with certain exceptions,
prohibits the Governor from extraditing any person in this State who is charged
with a crime in another state if the crime alleged involves the provision or receipt of
or assistance with reproductive health care services. (NRS 179.540) Section 2 of
this bill similarly prohibits the Governor from extraditing a person in this State who
is charged with a crime in another state if the crime involves the provision or
receipt of or assistance with medically necessary gender-affirming health care
services, unless the crime charged in the other state would also be a crime in this

State. Section 2, as an exception to this prohibition, authorizes the extradition of a
person who was physically present in the other state at the time of the commission
of the alleged offense.
Existing law prohibits a state agency from providing any information or
expending or using any resources in furtherance of any investigation or proceeding
initiated in or by another state that seeks to impose civil or criminal liability or
professional sanction on a person or entity for providing, securing, receiving,
making an inquiry concerning or providing certain assistance concerning
reproductive health care services that are legal in this State, except under certain
limited circumstances. (NRS 232.0088) Section 3 of this bill prohibits state
agencies in the Executive Department of the State Government from providing
information or expending any resources of the State in furtherance of such an
investigation or proceeding concerning medically necessary gender-affirming
health care services, except under certain limited circumstances.
