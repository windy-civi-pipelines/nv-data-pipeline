AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting health care licensing
boards from disqualifying from licensure or disciplining a
person for providing or assisting in the provision of
medically necessary gender-affirming health care
services; prohibiting in certain circumstances the
Governor from extraditing a person who is charged with a
crime in another state related to medically necessary
gender-affirming health care services; prohibiting state

certain health care licensing boards to examine the
feasibility of reciprocal licensure for health care providers
who provide gender-affirming health care services in
other states; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the licensing, certification and registration of various
2 providers of health care in this State. (Chapters 630-637B and 639-641D of NRS)
3 Existing law prohibits a health care licensing board from disqualifying from
4 licensure or subjecting a person to discipline solely: (1) for providing reproductive
5 health care services that are lawful and consistent with the practice of the relevant
6 profession in this State; or (2) as a consequence of certain adverse actions
7 threatened or imposed in another jurisdiction for the provision of such reproductive
8 health care services. (NRS 629.250) Section 1 of this bill additionally prohibits a
9 health care licensing board from taking similar actions against a person for
10 providing or assisting in the provision of medically necessary gender-affirming
11 health care services that are lawful in this State. Section 4 of this bill requires each

– 2 –
12 health care licensing board that licenses providers of health care who provide
13 gender-affirming health care services to examine the feasibility of providing
14 reciprocal licensing to providers of health care in other states to facilitate the
15 provision of gender-affirming health care services to persons from other states who
16 seek such medically necessary services in this State.
17 In accordance with the Extradition Clause of Section 2 of Article IV of the
18 United States Constitution, existing state law requires the Governor to extradite to
19 another state any person charged in that state with a crime, who is found in this
20 State. (NRS 179.181) Under existing law, the Governor is also authorized, but not
21 required, to extradite to another state any person in this State charged in the other
22 state with committing an act in this State intentionally resulting in a crime in the
23 state demanding extradition. (NRS 179.189) Existing law, with certain exceptions,
24 prohibits the Governor from extraditing any person in this State who is charged
25 with a crime in another state if the crime alleged involves the provision or receipt of
26 or assistance with reproductive health care services. (NRS 179.540) Section 2 of
27 this bill similarly prohibits the Governor from extraditing a person in this State who
28 is charged with a crime in another state if the crime involves the provision or
29 receipt of or assistance with medically necessary gender-affirming health care
30 services, unless the crime charged in the other state would also be a crime in this
31 State. Section 2, as an exception to this prohibition, authorizes the extradition of a
32 person who was physically present in the other state at the time of the commission
33 of the alleged offense.
34 Existing law prohibits a state agency from providing any information or
35 expending or using any resources in furtherance of any investigation or proceeding
36 initiated in or by another state that seeks to impose civil or criminal liability or
37 professional sanction on a person or entity for providing, securing, receiving,
38 making an inquiry concerning or providing certain assistance concerning
39 reproductive health care services that are legal in this State, except under certain
40 limited circumstances. (NRS 232.0088) Section 3 of this bill prohibits state
41 agencies in the Executive Department of the State Government from providing
42 information or expending any resources of the State in furtherance of such an
43 investigation or proceeding concerning medically necessary gender-affirming
44 health care services, except under certain limited circumstances.
