EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to pharmacy; authorizing a registered pharmacist
to prescribe drugs and devices to treat certain health
conditions; authorizing a registered pharmacist to
administer drugs; authorizing a registered pharmacist to
engage in certain activity relating to laboratories and
laboratory testing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain conditions, a pharmacist to dispense a
2 self-administered hormonal contraceptive without a prescription and prescribe and
3 dispense a drug for the medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. (NRS
4 639.28078, 639.28079) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a registered pharmacist to
5 prescribe and dispense drugs and devices for the treatment of health conditions that:
6 (1) have been previously diagnosed; (2) are self-limiting; (3) are diagnosed after the
7 performance of certain tests; or (4) threaten the health of the patient. Section 1
8 additionally prohibits a registered pharmacist from prescribing drugs and devices
9 not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Section 1 also
10 authorizes the State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the
11 scope of the ability of a registered pharmacist to prescribe drugs and devices; (2)
12 the standard of care required of a registered pharmacist who prescribes drugs and
13 devices; and (3) the requirements for adequate liability insurance for registered
14 pharmacists who engage in such activities. Section 2 of this bill provides that
15 prescribing and dispensing drugs and devices pursuant to section 1 constitutes the
16 practice of pharmacy. Sections 3, 10-13 and 15 of this bill make additional changes
17 necessary to authorize a registered pharmacist to prescribe and dispense drugs and
18 devices pursuant to section 1. The Board would be authorized to suspend or revoke
19 the registration of a pharmacist who prescribes or dispenses a drug or device
20 without complying with the provisions of section 1 or the regulations adopted
21 pursuant thereto. (NRS 639.210)

– 2 –
22 Existing law includes within the practice of pharmacy the performance or
23 supervision of activities associated with manufacturing, compounding, labeling,
24 dispensing and distributing a drug. (NRS 629.0124) Section 2 additionally includes
25 the performance or supervision of activities associated with administering a drug,
26 thereby authorizing a registered pharmacist to perform or supervise such activities.
27 Sections 14, 16 and 17 of this bill accordingly provide general authorization for a
28 registered pharmacist to possess and administer controlled substances and
29 dangerous drugs.
30 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
31 manipulation of a person for the collection of specimens by a registered pharmacist
32 that: (1) require the pharmacist to use only a fingerstick or oral or nasal swab to
33 collect the specimens; and (2) set forth the procedures and requirements the
34 pharmacist is required to follow when manipulating a person for the collection of a
35 specimen. (NRS 639.0747) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement that a
36 pharmacist use only a fingerstick or oral or nasal swab to collect a specimen,
37 thereby authorizing a pharmacist to collect a specimen using any method available
38 for the collection of the specimen.
39 Existing law authorizes a registered pharmacist or a registered intern
40 pharmacist to: (1) perform a home blood glucose test; and (2) order and perform
41 laboratory tests that are necessary for therapy that uses a drug approved by the
42 United States Food and Drug Administration for preventing the acquisition of
43 human immunodeficiency virus. (NRS 639.2808, 639.28085) Section 5 of this bill
44 additionally authorizes a registered pharmacist to: (1) order laboratory tests that are
45 necessary for any drug therapy or that otherwise facilitate the care of a patient
46 within the authorized scope of practice of the pharmacist; and (2) perform certain
47 other laboratory tests determined by the Federal Government to be simple
48 laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an
49 erroneous result. (42 U.S.C. 263a(d)(3); 42 C.F.R. Part 493, Subpart A) Section 5
50 also authorizes the State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations to authorize
51 registered intern pharmacists to order and perform such laboratory tests. Section 2
52 provides that ordering and performing such laboratory tests constitutes the practice
53 of pharmacy. Sections 2 and 6 of this bill remove duplicative provisions from
54 existing law. Sections 8, 9 and 18-24 of this bill make conforming changes so that
55 requirements for insurance coverage of certain services performed by registered
56 pharmacists are not changed by this bill.
57 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations for the
58 certification and licensure of laboratory directors. (NRS 652.125) Existing
59 regulations define an exempt laboratory to be a laboratory that: (1) conducts only
60 certain microscopy tests and tests determined by the Federal Government to be
61 simple laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an
62 erroneous result; and (2) does not perform only tests for human immunodeficiency
63 virus. (42 U.S.C. 263a(d)(3); 42 C.F.R. Part 493, Subpart A; NAC 652.072)
64 Section 7 of this bill requires regulations of the Board to authorize a registered
65 pharmacist to serve as the laboratory director of an exempt laboratory.
