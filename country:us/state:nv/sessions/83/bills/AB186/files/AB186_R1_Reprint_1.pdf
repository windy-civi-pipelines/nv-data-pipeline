AN ACT relating to pharmacy; authorizing a registered pharmacist
to prescribe drugs and devices to treat certain health
conditions and dispense a refill without the authorization
of a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, under certain
circumstances; authorizing a registered pharmacist to
administer drugs; authorizing a registered pharmacist to
engage in certain activity relating to laboratories and
laboratory testing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain conditions, a pharmacist to dispense a
2 self-administered hormonal contraceptive without a prescription and prescribe and
3 dispense a drug for the medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. (NRS
4 639.28078, 639.28079) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a registered pharmacist to
5 prescribe and dispense drugs and devices for the treatment of health conditions that:
6 (1) have been previously diagnosed; (2) are self-limiting; or (3) are acute conditions
7 diagnosed after the performance of certain tests. Section 1 additionally authorizes a
8 registered pharmacist to dispense a one-time refill of a prescription without the
9 authorization of a practitioner, other than a pharmacist, if the drug was previously
10 prescribed to the patient and losing access to the drug would threaten the health of
11 the patient. Section 1 additionally prohibits a registered pharmacist from taking
12 such action with regard to: (1) drugs and devices not approved by the United States
13 Food and Drug Administration; (2) controlled substances that are not opioids,
14 except in certain clinical settings; and (3) controlled substances that are an opioid
15 except in accordance with the protocols for prescribing and dispensing a drug for
16 medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 639.28079) Section 1 also authorizes the State
17 Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the scope of the ability of
18 a registered pharmacist to prescribe drugs and devices and dispense refills without
19 the authorization of another type of practitioner; (2) the standard of care required of
-
*AB186_R1*

– 2 –
20 a registered pharmacist who engages in such activities; and (3) the requirements for
21 adequate liability insurance for registered pharmacists who engage in such
22 activities. Section 2 of this bill provides that prescribing and dispensing drugs and
23 devices and dispensing refills pursuant to section 1 constitutes the practice of
24 pharmacy. Sections 3, 10-13 and 15 of this bill make additional changes necessary
25 to authorize a registered pharmacist to prescribe and dispense drugs and devices
26 and dispense refills without the authorization of another type of practitioner
27 pursuant to section 1. The Board would be authorized to suspend or revoke the
28 registration of a pharmacist who prescribes or dispenses a drug or device or
29 dispenses a refill without the authorization of another type of practitioner and fails
30 to comply with the provisions of section 1 or the regulations adopted pursuant
31 thereto. (NRS 639.210)
32 Existing law includes within the practice of pharmacy the performance or
33 supervision of activities associated with manufacturing, compounding, labeling,
34 dispensing and distributing a drug. (NRS 629.0124) Section 2 additionally includes
35 the performance or supervision of activities associated with administering a drug,
36 thereby authorizing a registered pharmacist to perform or supervise such activities.
37 Sections 14, 16 and 17 of this bill accordingly provide general authorization for a
38 registered pharmacist to possess and administer controlled substances and
39 dangerous drugs.
40 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
41 manipulation of a person for the collection of specimens by a registered pharmacist
42 that: (1) require the pharmacist to use only a fingerstick or oral or nasal swab to
43 collect the specimens; and (2) set forth the procedures and requirements the
44 pharmacist is required to follow when manipulating a person for the collection of a
45 specimen. (NRS 639.0747) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement that a
46 pharmacist use only a fingerstick or oral or nasal swab to collect a specimen,
47 thereby authorizing a pharmacist to collect a specimen using any method available
48 for the collection of the specimen.
49 Existing law authorizes a registered pharmacist or a registered intern
50 pharmacist to: (1) perform a home blood glucose test; and (2) order and perform
51 laboratory tests that are necessary for therapy that uses a drug approved by the
52 United States Food and Drug Administration for preventing the acquisition of
53 human immunodeficiency virus. (NRS 639.2808, 639.28085) Section 5 of this bill
54 additionally authorizes a registered pharmacist to: (1) order laboratory tests that are
55 necessary for any drug therapy or that otherwise facilitate the care of a patient
56 within the authorized scope of practice of the pharmacist; and (2) perform certain
57 other laboratory tests determined by the Federal Government to be simple
58 laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an
59 erroneous result. (42 U.S.C. 263a(d)(3); 42 C.F.R. Part 493, Subpart A) Section 5
60 also authorizes the State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations to authorize
61 registered intern pharmacists to order and perform such laboratory tests. Section 2
62 provides that ordering and performing such laboratory tests constitutes the practice
63 of pharmacy. Sections 2 and 6 of this bill remove duplicative provisions from
64 existing law. Sections 8, 9 and 18-24 of this bill make conforming changes so that
65 requirements for insurance coverage of certain services performed by registered
66 pharmacists are not changed by this bill.
67 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations for the
68 certification and licensure of laboratory directors. (NRS 652.125) Existing
69 regulations define an exempt laboratory to be a laboratory that: (1) conducts only
70 certain microscopy tests and tests determined by the Federal Government to be
71 simple laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an
72 erroneous result; and (2) does not perform only tests for human immunodeficiency
73 virus. (42 U.S.C. 493.19; 42 C.F.R. Part 493, Subpart A; NAC 652.072) Section 7
-

74 of this bill requires regulations of the Board to authorize a registered pharmacist to
75 serve as the laboratory director of an exempt laboratory.
