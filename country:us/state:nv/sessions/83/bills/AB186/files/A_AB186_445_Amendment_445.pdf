AN ACT relating to pharmacy; authorizing a registered pharmacist to prescribe
drugs and devices to treat certain health conditions [;] and dispense a
refill without the authorization of a practitioner, other than a
pharmacist, under certain circumstances; authorizing a registered
pharmacist to administer drugs; authorizing a registered pharmacist to
engage in certain activity relating to laboratories and laboratory testing;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, under certain conditions, a pharmacist to dispense a self-
2 administered hormonal contraceptive without a prescription and prescribe and dispense a drug
3 for the medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. (NRS 639.28078, 639.28079)
4 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a registered pharmacist to prescribe and dispense drugs and
5 devices for the treatment of health conditions that: (1) have been previously diagnosed; (2) are
6 self-limiting; or (3) are acute conditions diagnosed after the performance of certain tests . [;
7 or (4)] Section 1 additionally authorizes a registered pharmacist to dispense a one-time
8 refill of a prescription without the authorization of a practitioner, other than a
9 pharmacist, if the drug was previously prescribed to the patient and losing access to the
10 drug would threaten the health of the patient. Section 1 additionally prohibits a registered
11 pharmacist from [prescribing:] taking such action with regard to: (1) drugs and devices not
12 approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration [.] ; (2) controlled substances
13 that are not opioids, except in certain clinical settings; and (3) controlled substances that
14 are an opioid except in accordance with the protocols for prescribing and dispensing a
15 drug for medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 639.28079) Section 1 also authorizes the
16 State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the scope of the ability of a
17 registered pharmacist to prescribe drugs and devices [;] and dispense refills without the
18 authorization of another type of practitioner; (2) the standard of care required of a
19 registered pharmacist who [prescribes drugs and devices;] engages in such activities; and (3)
20 the requirements for adequate liability insurance for registered pharmacists who engage in
21 such activities. Section 2 of this bill provides that prescribing and dispensing drugs and
22 devices and dispensing refills pursuant to section 1 constitutes the practice of pharmacy.
23 Sections 3, 10-13 and 15 of this bill make additional changes necessary to authorize a
24 registered pharmacist to prescribe and dispense drugs and devices and dispense refills
25 without the authorization of another type of practitioner pursuant to section 1. The Board
26 would be authorized to suspend or revoke the registration of a pharmacist who prescribes or
27 dispenses a drug or device or dispenses a refill without [complying] the authorization of

Assembly Amendment No. 445 to Assembly Bill No. 186 Page 4
28 another type of practitioner and fails to comply with the provisions of section 1 or the
29 regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (NRS 639.210)
30 Existing law includes within the practice of pharmacy the performance or supervision of
31 activities associated with manufacturing, compounding, labeling, dispensing and distributing a
32 drug. (NRS 629.0124) Section 2 additionally includes the performance or supervision of
33 activities associated with administering a drug, thereby authorizing a registered pharmacist to
34 perform or supervise such activities. Sections 14, 16 and 17 of this bill accordingly provide
35 general authorization for a registered pharmacist to possess and administer controlled
36 substances and dangerous drugs.
37 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the manipulation of a
38 person for the collection of specimens by a registered pharmacist that: (1) require the
39 pharmacist to use only a fingerstick or oral or nasal swab to collect the specimens; and (2) set
40 forth the procedures and requirements the pharmacist is required to follow when manipulating
41 a person for the collection of a specimen. (NRS 639.0747) Section 4 of this bill removes the
42 requirement that a pharmacist use only a fingerstick or oral or nasal swab to collect a
43 specimen, thereby authorizing a pharmacist to collect a specimen using any method available
44 for the collection of the specimen.
45 Existing law authorizes a registered pharmacist or a registered intern pharmacist to: (1)
46 perform a home blood glucose test; and (2) order and perform laboratory tests that are
47 necessary for therapy that uses a drug approved by the United States Food and Drug
48 Administration for preventing the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. (NRS
49 639.2808, 639.28085) Section 5 of this bill additionally authorizes a registered pharmacist to:
50 (1) order laboratory tests that are necessary for any drug therapy or that otherwise facilitate
51 the care of a patient within the authorized scope of practice of the pharmacist; and (2) perform
52 certain other laboratory tests determined by the Federal Government to be simple laboratory
53 examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result. (42 U.S.C.
54 263a(d)(3); 42 C.F.R. Part 493, Subpart A) Section 5 also authorizes the State Board of
55 Pharmacy to adopt regulations to authorize registered intern pharmacists to order and perform
56 such laboratory tests. Section 2 provides that ordering and performing such laboratory tests
57 constitutes the practice of pharmacy. Sections 2 and 6 of this bill remove duplicative
58 provisions from existing law. Sections 8, 9 and 18-24 of this bill make conforming changes
59 so that requirements for insurance coverage of certain services performed by registered
60 pharmacists are not changed by this bill.
61 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations for the certification
62 and licensure of laboratory directors. (NRS 652.125) Existing regulations define an exempt
63 laboratory to be a laboratory that: (1) conducts only certain microscopy tests and tests
64 determined by the Federal Government to be simple laboratory examinations and procedures
65 that have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result; and (2) does not perform only tests for
66 human immunodeficiency virus. (42 U.S.C. [263a(d)(3);] 493.19; 42 C.F.R. Part 493, Subpart
67 A; NAC 652.072) Section 7 of this bill requires regulations of the Board to authorize a
68 registered pharmacist to serve as the laboratory director of an exempt laboratory.
