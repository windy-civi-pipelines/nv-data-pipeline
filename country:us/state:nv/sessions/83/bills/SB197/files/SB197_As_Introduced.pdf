EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; establishing various
requirements relating to the placement of certain persons
on a Brady-Giglio list; providing certain rights to certain
law enforcement officers and employees of a law
enforcement agency; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In Brady v. Maryland, the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor
2 may violate the due process protections guaranteed by the United States
3 Constitution if the prosecutor withholds “evidence favorable to the accused” in a
4 criminal case, thus undermining the defendant’s right to a fair trial. (373 U.S. 83,
5 86-87 (1963)) This includes evidence that could impeach the credibility of a
6 witness. (Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972)) Section 1 of this bill
7 defines the term “Brady-Giglio list” to mean a system, index, list or other record
8 established and maintained by a prosecuting agency for the purpose of satisfying
9 the obligation of the prosecuting agency to disclose exculpatory evidence to a
10 defendant pursuant to Brady v. Maryland and Giglio v. United States. Section 1
11 requires a prosecuting agency that maintains a Brady-Giglio list to adopt a policy
12 concerning the placement of a law enforcement officer or employee of a law
13 enforcement agency on a Brady-Giglio list. Section 1 also: (1) sets forth certain
14 requirements relating to any such policy; (2) grants certain rights to a law
15 enforcement officer or employee of a law enforcement agency relating to placement
16 on a Brady-Giglio list; and (3) prohibits a prosecuting agency from disclosing
17 certain information concerning a law enforcement officer or employee of a law
18 enforcement agency who may be called as a witness in a criminal case under
19 certain circumstances.
20 Section 2 of this bill requires a prosecuting agency to notify each law
21 enforcement officer or employee of a law enforcement agency whose name is
22 included on a Brady-Giglio list on July 1, 2025, of the right of the officer or
23 employee to submit a request for reconsideration of the placement of the officer or

24 employee on the Brady-Giglio list. Section 2 also requires a prosecuting agency to
25 remove the officer or employee from the Brady-Giglio list if: (1) the prosecuting
26 agency determines that the conduct of the officer or employee does not warrant
27 inclusion of the officer or employee on the Brady-Giglio list; and (2) certain other
28 requirements are met.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
