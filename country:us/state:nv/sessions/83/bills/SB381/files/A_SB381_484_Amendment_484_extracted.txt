properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a sheriff to appoint one or more deputies who are authorized to
2 perform all the duties devolving on the sheriff of the county and such other duties as the
3 sheriff may from time to time direct. (NRS 248.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a sheriff
4 to appoint civil enforcement officers who are authorized to perform certain duties of the
5 sheriff relating to the service, posting and enforcement of certain notices and writs. Section 7
6 of this bill similarly authorizes a constable to appoint such officers. Section 25 of this bill
7 provides that a civil enforcement officer is not governed by certain provisions set forth in
8 existing law for the licensure and regulation of process servers who are not peace officers.
9 (NRS 648.014)
10 Existing law further provides that a person who is employed as clerical or operational
11 staff of a constable does not have the powers of a peace officer and prohibits such a person
12 from possessing or carrying a weapon or concealed firearm while performing his or her
Senate Amendment No. 484 to Senate Bill No. 381 Page 4
13 official duties. (NRS 258.065) Section 9 of this bill makes such provisions, with certain
14 exceptions, applicable to any person who works under the direction and supervision of a
15 constable, including, without limitation, an appointee, employee, contractor or volunteer of
16 the constable, and removes the prohibition for such persons to possess or carry a weapon
17 while performing his or her official duties. Section 14 of this bill removes language made
18 duplicative by the provisions of section 9.
19 Existing law requires all sales of property under execution to be made at auction to the
20 highest bidder and requires such an auction to take place between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5
21 p.m. at the courthouse of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.
22 (NRS 21.150) Section 19 of this bill authorizes such a sale of real property to be conducted on
23 the Internet website of an operator of an online auction for real property or other electronic
24 means. Sections 3 and 8 of this bill authorize a sheriff and constable, respectively, to enter
25 into a contract with such an operator to sell the property by an auction conducted on the
26 Internet website of the operator or other electronic means.
27 Existing law requires a sheriff to take property which is the subject of a claim to delivery
28 and described in a writ of possession if it is in the possession of a defendant or an agent of the
29 defendant and retain it in his or her custody. (NRS 31.840, 31.870) If the property, or any part
30 of the property, is concealed in a building or enclosure, existing law requires the sheriff to
31 publicly demand delivery of the property. If the property is not delivered, existing law
32 requires the sheriff to cause the building or enclosure to be broken open and to take the
33 property and authorizes, if necessary, the sheriff to call the power of the sheriff’s county to his
34 or her aid. (NRS 31.920) Sections 4 and 10 of this bill provide that a sheriff or constable is
35 subject to such requirements after the receipt of any writ or order that directs the sheriff or
36 constable to take the property described in it. Section 27 of this bill repeals a provision
37 concerning writs of possession which is made duplicative by the provisions of sections 4 and
38 10.
39 [Existing law authorizes the sheriff of each county in this State to charge and collect
40 certain fees for certain services provided by the sheriff. (NRS 248.275) Section 5 of this bill
41 revises such fees. Section 16 of this bill similarly revises the fees that a constable is entitled to
42 for certain services provided by the constable. (NRS 258.125) Section 15 of this bill makes
43 conforming changes to remove references to provisions that were relocated to sections 5 and
44 16. Sections 17, 23 and 24 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the renumbering
45 and relocation of certain fees.]
46 Section 11 of this bill removes a requirement for each constable of a township whose
47 population is 15,000 or more, or a township that has within its boundaries a city whose
48 population is 15,000 or more, to become certified by the Peace Officers’ Standards and
49 Training Commission as a category I or category II peace officer within 1 year after the date
50 on which the constable commences his or her term of office or appointment.
51 Existing law: (1) requires any person who is a candidate for the office of constable in a
52 township whose population is 100,000 or more to be certified by the Commission as a
53 category I or category II peace officer before filing a declaration of candidacy for the office;
54 and (2) provides that a constable forfeits his or her office if he or she does not maintain such a
55 certification. (NRS 258.007) Section 11 instead: (1) requires that a person who is a candidate
56 for the office of constable in a township whose population is 100,000 or more in a county
57 whose population is 100,000 or more to be certified by the Commission as a category I or
58 category II peace officer before filing a declaration of candidacy for the office; and (2)
59 provides that a constable forfeits his or her office if he does not maintain such a certification.
60 Existing law authorizes a constable to appoint deputies who are authorized to transact all
61 official business pertaining to the office to the same extent as their principals and sets forth
62 certain requirements for such a position, including a requirement for a person who is
63 appointed as a deputy constable in certain townships to be certified by the Commission as a
64 category I or category II peace officer before commencing his or her employment. (NRS
65 258.060) Section 13 of this bill instead prohibits any deputy constable from being appointed
66 unless he or she is so certified.
67 Existing law requires a constable or deputy constable who is authorized to carry a firearm
68 to receive training approved by the Commission in the use of firearms at least once every 6
69 months. (NRS 258.070) Section 15 of this bill requires such training to include any
70 continuing education that addresses firearms and is required for a category II officer,
Senate Amendment No. 484 to Senate Bill No. 381 Page 5
71 including, without limitation, any requirements concerning the demonstration of a minimum
72 level of proficiency in the use of firearms.
73 Section 15 further prohibits, with certain exceptions, a constable from executing any writ,
74 warrant or other order of a court in a criminal case unless the writ, warrant or order is
75 delivered to the constable for execution by certain appropriate persons.
76 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county which includes
77 only one township to, by resolution, appoint the sheriff ex officio constable to serve without
78 additional compensation. Additionally, if a board of county commissioners in a county whose
79 population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County) which
80 includes more than one township or a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
81 only Clark County) determines that the office of constable is not necessary in one or more
82 townships, existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to abolish the office of
83 constable in a township and to appoint the sheriff ex officio constable. (NRS 258.010) Section
84 12 of this bill instead authorizes a board of county commissioners in any county which
85 includes more than one township to take such actions under such circumstances.
86 Existing law authorizes a constable to perform, with respect to certain provisions
87 concerning writs of execution, garnishment and attachment, any of the duties assigned to a
88 sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority granted to a sheriff with respect
89 to such provisions. (NRS 21.111, 31.235) Sections 18 and 20 of this bill instead provide that
90 for certain provisions concerning remedies, including writs of attachment, garnishment and
91 arrest and bail, as well as certain provisions concerning the enforcement of certain judgments
92 including writs of execution or garnishment, a constable is authorized to perform any of the
93 duties assigned to a sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority granted to a
94 sheriff with respect to any process, writ or order in a civil case.
95 Existing law authorizes execution on a writ of garnishment to occur only if the sheriff
96 mails a copy of the writ with a copy of the notice of execution to the defendant in a certain
97 manner and provides that, in the case of a writ of garnishment that continues for 180 days or
98 until the amount demanded in the writ is satisfied, a copy of the writ and the notice of
99 execution need only be mailed once to the defendant. (NRS 31.260) Section 21 of this bill
100 instead: (1) requires the sheriff to mail a copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of
101 execution with the copy of the notice of execution; and (2) provides that in the case of a writ
102 of garnishment that continues for 180 days or until the amount demanded in the writ is
103 satisfied, a copy of the writ of execution and the notice of execution need only be mailed once
104 to the defendant.
105 Existing law requires, when six or more persons are unlawfully or riotously assembled in
106 any town, the sheriff of the county and the sheriff’s deputies or the constable of the town and
107 the justice of the peace to: (1) go among the persons so assembled and command such persons
108 in the name of the people of the United States and the State of Nevada to disperse
109 immediately; and (2) if such persons do not disperse, arrest them. Further, existing law
110 provides that a magistrate or officer who neglects or refuses to proceed to the place of
111 assembly and exercise such powers is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 269.230) Section 22 of
112 this bill: (1) removes such a duty from a magistrate or constable; (2) places such a duty upon
113 the chief of police or his or her peace officers; and (3) instead requires such a command to
114 only be given in the name of the people of the State of Nevada.
115 Existing law authorizes a magistrate to depute in writing any suitable and discreet person
116 to act as constable when no constable is at hand and the nature of the business requires
117 immediate action. (NRS 171.116) Existing law additionally provides that any constable who
118 willfully refuses to arrest any person charged with a criminal offense is guilty of a gross
119 misdemeanor and requires such a constable to be removed from office. (NRS 258.110)
120 Section 27 repeals such provisions.

8 sheriff is employed.

22 person.
23 2. The writ of garnishment must also notify the garnishee defendant that, if
24 the garnishee defendant fails to answer the interrogatories, a judgment by default
25 will be rendered against the garnishee defendant for:
26 (a) The amount demanded in the writ of garnishment or the value of the
27 property described in the writ, as the case may be; or
28 (b) If the garnishment is pursuant to NRS 31.291, the amount of the lien
29 created pursuant to that section,
30  which amount or property must be clearly set forth in the writ of garnishment.
31 3. Execution on the writ of garnishment may occur only if the sheriff mails a
32 copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of execution with a copy of the notice
33 of execution to the defendant in the manner and within the time prescribed in NRS
34 21.076. In the case of a writ of garnishment that continues for 180 days or until the
35 amount demanded in the writ is satisfied, a copy of the writ of execution and the
36 notice of execution need only be mailed once to the defendant.
37 Sec. 22. NRS 269.230 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 269.230 1. When six or more persons, whether armed or not, shall be
39 unlawfully or riotously assembled in any town, the sheriff of the county [and the
40 sheriff’s] or his or her deputies [,] or the [constable of the town, and the justice of
41 the peace] chief of police of the city or his or her peace officers, as applicable,
42 shall go among the persons so assembled, or as near as possible, and shall
43 command them, in the name of the people of [the United States and] the State of
44 Nevada, to disperse immediately.
45 2. If the persons assembled do not immediately disperse, the [magistrates and]
46 officers shall arrest them, that they be punished according to law, and for that
47 purpose may command the aid of all persons present or within the county.
48 3. If [a magistrate or] an officer, having notice of an unlawful or riotous
49 assembly, as provided in subsection 1, [neglect] neglects or [refuse] refuses to
50 proceed to the place of assembly, or as near thereto as the [magistrate or] officer
51 can with safety, and to exercise the authority with which the [magistrate or] officer
52 is invested for suppressing the same and arresting the offenders, the [magistrate or]
Senate Amendment No. 484 to Senate Bill No. 381 Page 19
1 officer shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished
2 accordingly.
3 Sec. 23. [NRS 487.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:

5 (a) An automobile wrecker may only charge and collect those fees for towing
6 an abandoned automobile as are prescribed by regulations of the Department.
7 (b) An automobile wrecker shall not charge a fee to tow an abandoned vehicle
8 if the automobile wrecker does not obtain the consent of the owner of the property
9 to tow the vehicle.
10 2. When an automobile wrecker removes an abandoned vehicle from public
11 property at the request of a constable as provided in NRS 487.230, the automobile
12 wrecker shall:
13 (a) If the owner of the abandoned vehicle can be identified and if the
14 automobile wrecker is able to collect from the owner the fee described in paragraph
15 (d) of subsection [2] 1 of NRS 258.125, transmit that fee to the constable; or
16 (b) If the owner of the abandoned vehicle cannot be identified or if the
17 automobile wrecker is otherwise unable to collect from the owner the fee described
18 in paragraph (d) of subsection [2] 1 of NRS 258.125, transmit that fee to the
19 constable only if the automobile wrecker is able to satisfy his or her own lien, as
20 provided in NRS 487.270.] (Deleted by amendment.)
21 Sec. 24. [NRS 487.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 487.270 1. Whenever a vehicle has been removed to a garage or other place
23 as provided by NRS 487.230, the owner of the garage or the automobile wrecker or
24 operator of a tow car who towed the vehicle has a lien on the vehicle for:
25 (a) The costs of towing and storing for a period not exceeding 90 days; and
26 (b) If the vehicle was removed from public property at the request of a
27 constable, the fee described in paragraph (d) of subsection [2] 1 of NRS 258.125.
28 2. If the vehicle is appraised at a value of less than $1,500, or less than such
29 other value greater than $1,500 which the Department may establish by regulation,
30 and is not reclaimed within the period prescribed in NRS 487.250, the owner of the
31 garage, automobile wrecker or operator of a tow car may satisfy his or her lien by
32 retaining the vehicle and obtaining a certificate pursuant to NRS 487.880, if
33 applicable, a salvage title as provided in NRS 487.810 or an unbranded title
34 pursuant to subsection 4.
35 3. If the vehicle is appraised at a value of more than $1,500, or more than
36 such other value greater than $1,500 which the Department may establish by

38 automobile wrecker or operator of a tow car may satisfy his or her lien, in
39 accordance with the provisions of NRS 108.265 to 108.367, inclusive. Before such
40 a person may sell the vehicle, the person shall obtain a certificate pursuant to NRS
41 487.880, if applicable, a salvage title as provided in NRS 487.810 or an unbranded
42 title pursuant to subsection 4.
43 4. Before an automobile wrecker or operator of a tow car satisfies his or her
44 lien pursuant to subsection 2 or 3, the automobile wrecker or operator of a tow car
45 may request that the Department issue an unbranded title for the vehicle. The
46 Department shall issue the unbranded title if the automobile wrecker or operator of
47 a tow car submits to the Department a certificate of inspection in such form as the
48 Department may prescribe which has been completed and signed by a garage
49 operator who operates a garage that is registered pursuant to NRS 487.560, by the

3 (b) The vehicle meets the standards of the vehicle manufacturer for mechanical
4 fitness and safety;
5 (c) Any safety equipment, including, without limitation, occupant restraint
6 devices, which was present in the vehicle at the time the vehicle was manufactured
7 is present and operational to the standards of the manufacturer and the provisions of
8 49 C.F.R. §§ 571.208 and 571.209; and
9 (d) The vehicle is in a condition to be operated safely on the highways of this
10 State.
11 5. Nothing in subsection 4 shall be construed as requiring the Department to
12 change the existing status of a certificate of title, including, without limitation, any
13 designation that a vehicle is a salvage vehicle or rebuilt vehicle.
14 6. If the vehicle was removed from public property at the request of a
15 constable and the owner of the garage or automobile wrecker satisfies his or her
16 lien pursuant to subsection 2 or 3, the owner of the garage or automobile wrecker
17 shall transmit to the constable the fee described in paragraph (d) of subsection [2] 1
18 of NRS 258.125.
19 7. As used in this section:
20 (a) “Operator of a tow car” means the operator of a tow car who holds a
21 certificate of public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to NRS 706.4463.
22 (b) “Unbranded title” means a certificate of title that does not include a
23 specified designation, including, without limitation, a designation that a motor
24 vehicle is a salvage vehicle or rebuilt vehicle.] (Deleted by amendment.)
25 Sec. 25. NRS 648.014 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 648.014 “Process server” means a person, other than a peace officer of the
27 State of Nevada [,] or a civil enforcement officer who is appointed pursuant to
28 section 2 or 7 of this act, who engages in the business of serving legal process
29 within this State.
30 Sec. 26. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any additional
31 expenses of a local government that are related to the provisions of this act.
32 Sec. 27. NRS 31.920, 171.116 and 258.110 are hereby repealed.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing a sheriff or constable
to appoint a civil enforcement officer; authorizing the electronic sale of
real property under execution; authorizing a sheriff or constable to
enter into a contract to conduct such a sale; [revising certain fees to
which a sheriff or constable is entitled for certain services;] revising
the powers and duties of certain persons under the direction and
supervision of a constable or sheriff; revising the powers and duties of
sheriffs, constables and deputy constables; revising the qualifications
of constables; eliminating the authority of certain boards of county
commissioners to abolish the office of constable in certain townships;
revising provisions relating to the service, execution and enforcement
of certain process, writs and remedies; revising provisions relating to
duties required of certain officers for unlawful or riotous assemblies;
repealing a provision authorizing a magistrate to depute a person to act
as constable under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a sheriff to appoint one or more deputies who are authorized to
2 perform all the duties devolving on the sheriff of the county and such other duties as the
3 sheriff may from time to time direct. (NRS 248.040) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a sheriff
4 to appoint civil enforcement officers who are authorized to perform certain duties of the
5 sheriff relating to the service, posting and enforcement of certain notices and writs. Section 7
6 of this bill similarly authorizes a constable to appoint such officers. Section 25 of this bill
7 provides that a civil enforcement officer is not governed by certain provisions set forth in
8 existing law for the licensure and regulation of process servers who are not peace officers.
9 (NRS 648.014)
10 Existing law further provides that a person who is employed as clerical or operational
11 staff of a constable does not have the powers of a peace officer and prohibits such a person
12 from possessing or carrying a weapon or concealed firearm while performing his or her

Senate Amendment No. 484 to Senate Bill No. 381 Page 4
13 official duties. (NRS 258.065) Section 9 of this bill makes such provisions, with certain
14 exceptions, applicable to any person who works under the direction and supervision of a
15 constable, including, without limitation, an appointee, employee, contractor or volunteer of
16 the constable, and removes the prohibition for such persons to possess or carry a weapon
17 while performing his or her official duties. Section 14 of this bill removes language made
18 duplicative by the provisions of section 9.
19 Existing law requires all sales of property under execution to be made at auction to the
20 highest bidder and requires such an auction to take place between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5
21 p.m. at the courthouse of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated.
22 (NRS 21.150) Section 19 of this bill authorizes such a sale of real property to be conducted on
23 the Internet website of an operator of an online auction for real property or other electronic
24 means. Sections 3 and 8 of this bill authorize a sheriff and constable, respectively, to enter
25 into a contract with such an operator to sell the property by an auction conducted on the
26 Internet website of the operator or other electronic means.
27 Existing law requires a sheriff to take property which is the subject of a claim to delivery
28 and described in a writ of possession if it is in the possession of a defendant or an agent of the
29 defendant and retain it in his or her custody. (NRS 31.840, 31.870) If the property, or any part
30 of the property, is concealed in a building or enclosure, existing law requires the sheriff to
31 publicly demand delivery of the property. If the property is not delivered, existing law
32 requires the sheriff to cause the building or enclosure to be broken open and to take the
33 property and authorizes, if necessary, the sheriff to call the power of the sheriff’s county to his
34 or her aid. (NRS 31.920) Sections 4 and 10 of this bill provide that a sheriff or constable is
35 subject to such requirements after the receipt of any writ or order that directs the sheriff or
36 constable to take the property described in it. Section 27 of this bill repeals a provision
37 concerning writs of possession which is made duplicative by the provisions of sections 4 and
38 10.
39 [Existing law authorizes the sheriff of each county in this State to charge and collect
40 certain fees for certain services provided by the sheriff. (NRS 248.275) Section 5 of this bill
41 revises such fees. Section 16 of this bill similarly revises the fees that a constable is entitled to
42 for certain services provided by the constable. (NRS 258.125) Section 15 of this bill makes
43 conforming changes to remove references to provisions that were relocated to sections 5 and
44 16. Sections 17, 23 and 24 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the renumbering
45 and relocation of certain fees.]
46 Section 11 of this bill removes a requirement for each constable of a township whose
47 population is 15,000 or more, or a township that has within its boundaries a city whose
48 population is 15,000 or more, to become certified by the Peace Officers’ Standards and
49 Training Commission as a category I or category II peace officer within 1 year after the date
50 on which the constable commences his or her term of office or appointment.
51 Existing law: (1) requires any person who is a candidate for the office of constable in a
52 township whose population is 100,000 or more to be certified by the Commission as a
53 category I or category II peace officer before filing a declaration of candidacy for the office;
54 and (2) provides that a constable forfeits his or her office if he or she does not maintain such a
55 certification. (NRS 258.007) Section 11 instead: (1) requires that a person who is a candidate
56 for the office of constable in a township whose population is 100,000 or more in a county
57 whose population is 100,000 or more to be certified by the Commission as a category I or
58 category II peace officer before filing a declaration of candidacy for the office; and (2)
59 provides that a constable forfeits his or her office if he does not maintain such a certification.
60 Existing law authorizes a constable to appoint deputies who are authorized to transact all
61 official business pertaining to the office to the same extent as their principals and sets forth
62 certain requirements for such a position, including a requirement for a person who is
63 appointed as a deputy constable in certain townships to be certified by the Commission as a
64 category I or category II peace officer before commencing his or her employment. (NRS
65 258.060) Section 13 of this bill instead prohibits any deputy constable from being appointed
66 unless he or she is so certified.
67 Existing law requires a constable or deputy constable who is authorized to carry a firearm
68 to receive training approved by the Commission in the use of firearms at least once every 6
69 months. (NRS 258.070) Section 15 of this bill requires such training to include any
70 continuing education that addresses firearms and is required for a category II officer,

Senate Amendment No. 484 to Senate Bill No. 381 Page 5
71 including, without limitation, any requirements concerning the demonstration of a minimum
72 level of proficiency in the use of firearms.
73 Section 15 further prohibits, with certain exceptions, a constable from executing any writ,
74 warrant or other order of a court in a criminal case unless the writ, warrant or order is
75 delivered to the constable for execution by certain appropriate persons.
76 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county which includes
77 only one township to, by resolution, appoint the sheriff ex officio constable to serve without
78 additional compensation. Additionally, if a board of county commissioners in a county whose
79 population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County) which
80 includes more than one township or a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
81 only Clark County) determines that the office of constable is not necessary in one or more
82 townships, existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to abolish the office of
83 constable in a township and to appoint the sheriff ex officio constable. (NRS 258.010) Section
84 12 of this bill instead authorizes a board of county commissioners in any county which
85 includes more than one township to take such actions under such circumstances.
86 Existing law authorizes a constable to perform, with respect to certain provisions
87 concerning writs of execution, garnishment and attachment, any of the duties assigned to a
88 sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority granted to a sheriff with respect
89 to such provisions. (NRS 21.111, 31.235) Sections 18 and 20 of this bill instead provide that
90 for certain provisions concerning remedies, including writs of attachment, garnishment and
91 arrest and bail, as well as certain provisions concerning the enforcement of certain judgments
92 including writs of execution or garnishment, a constable is authorized to perform any of the
93 duties assigned to a sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority granted to a
94 sheriff with respect to any process, writ or order in a civil case.
95 Existing law authorizes execution on a writ of garnishment to occur only if the sheriff
96 mails a copy of the writ with a copy of the notice of execution to the defendant in a certain
97 manner and provides that, in the case of a writ of garnishment that continues for 180 days or
98 until the amount demanded in the writ is satisfied, a copy of the writ and the notice of
99 execution need only be mailed once to the defendant. (NRS 31.260) Section 21 of this bill
100 instead: (1) requires the sheriff to mail a copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of
101 execution with the copy of the notice of execution; and (2) provides that in the case of a writ
102 of garnishment that continues for 180 days or until the amount demanded in the writ is
103 satisfied, a copy of the writ of execution and the notice of execution need only be mailed once
104 to the defendant.
105 Existing law requires, when six or more persons are unlawfully or riotously assembled in
106 any town, the sheriff of the county and the sheriff’s deputies or the constable of the town and
107 the justice of the peace to: (1) go among the persons so assembled and command such persons
108 in the name of the people of the United States and the State of Nevada to disperse
109 immediately; and (2) if such persons do not disperse, arrest them. Further, existing law
110 provides that a magistrate or officer who neglects or refuses to proceed to the place of
111 assembly and exercise such powers is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 269.230) Section 22 of
112 this bill: (1) removes such a duty from a magistrate or constable; (2) places such a duty upon
113 the chief of police or his or her peace officers; and (3) instead requires such a command to
114 only be given in the name of the people of the State of Nevada.
115 Existing law authorizes a magistrate to depute in writing any suitable and discreet person
116 to act as constable when no constable is at hand and the nature of the business requires
117 immediate action. (NRS 171.116) Existing law additionally provides that any constable who
118 willfully refuses to arrest any person charged with a criminal offense is guilty of a gross
119 misdemeanor and requires such a constable to be removed from office. (NRS 258.110)
120 Section 27 repeals such provisions.
