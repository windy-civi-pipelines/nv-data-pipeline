Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a sheriff to appoint one or more deputies who are
2 authorized to perform all the duties devolving on the sheriff of the county and such
3 other duties as the sheriff may from time to time direct. (NRS 248.040) Section 2
4 of this bill authorizes a sheriff to appoint civil enforcement officers who are
5 authorized to perform certain duties of the sheriff relating to the service, posting
-

– 2 –
6 and enforcement of certain notices and writs. Section 7 of this bill similarly
7 authorizes a constable to appoint such officers. Section 25 of this bill provides that
8 a civil enforcement officer is not governed by certain provisions set forth in
9 existing law for the licensure and regulation of process servers who are not peace
10 officers. (NRS 648.014)
11 Existing law further provides that a person who is employed as clerical or
12 operational staff of a constable does not have the powers of a peace officer and
13 prohibits such a person from possessing or carrying a weapon or concealed firearm
14 while performing his or her official duties. (NRS 258.065) Section 9 of this bill
15 makes such provisions, with certain exceptions, applicable to any person who
16 works under the direction and supervision of a constable, including, without
17 limitation, an appointee, employee, contractor or volunteer of the constable, and
18 removes the prohibition for such persons to possess or carry a weapon while
19 performing his or her official duties. Section 14 of this bill removes language made
20 duplicative by the provisions of section 9.
21 Existing law requires all sales of property under execution to be made at
22 auction to the highest bidder and requires such an auction to take place between the
23 hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the courthouse of the county in which the property or
24 some part thereof is situated. (NRS 21.150) Section 19 of this bill authorizes such a
25 sale of real property to be conducted on the Internet website of an operator of an
26 online auction for real property or other electronic means. Sections 3 and 8 of this
27 bill authorize a sheriff and constable, respectively, to enter into a contract with such
28 an operator to sell the property by an auction conducted on the Internet website of
29 the operator or other electronic means.
30 Existing law requires a sheriff to take property which is the subject of a claim
31 to delivery and described in a writ of possession if it is in the possession of a
32 defendant or an agent of the defendant and retain it in his or her custody. (NRS
33 31.840, 31.870) If the property, or any part of the property, is concealed in a
34 building or enclosure, existing law requires the sheriff to publicly demand delivery
35 of the property. If the property is not delivered, existing law requires the sheriff to
36 cause the building or enclosure to be broken open and to take the property and
37 authorizes, if necessary, the sheriff to call the power of the sheriff’s county to his or
38 her aid. (NRS 31.920) Sections 4 and 10 of this bill provide that a sheriff or
39 constable is subject to such requirements after the receipt of any writ or order that
40 directs the sheriff or constable to take the property described in it. Section 27 of
41 this bill repeals a provision concerning writs of possession which is made
42 duplicative by the provisions of sections 4 and 10.
43 Section 11 of this bill removes a requirement for each constable of a township
44 whose population is 15,000 or more, or a township that has within its boundaries a
45 city whose population is 15,000 or more, to become certified by the Peace Officers’
46 Standards and Training Commission as a category I or category II peace officer
47 within 1 year after the date on which the constable commences his or her term of
48 office or appointment.
49 Existing law: (1) requires any person who is a candidate for the office of
50 constable in a township whose population is 100,000 or more to be certified by the
51 Commission as a category I or category II peace officer before filing a declaration
52 of candidacy for the office; and (2) provides that a constable forfeits his or her
53 office if he or she does not maintain such a certification. (NRS 258.007) Section 11
54 instead: (1) requires that a person who is a candidate for the office of constable in a
55 township whose population is 100,000 or more in a county whose population is
56 100,000 or more to be certified by the Commission as a category I or category II
57 peace officer before filing a declaration of candidacy for the office; and (2)
58 provides that a constable forfeits his or her office if he does not maintain such a
59 certification.

60 Existing law authorizes a constable to appoint deputies who are authorized to
61 transact all official business pertaining to the office to the same extent as their
62 principals and sets forth certain requirements for such a position, including a
63 requirement for a person who is appointed as a deputy constable in certain
64 townships to be certified by the Commission as a category I or category II peace
65 officer before commencing his or her employment. (NRS 258.060) Section 13 of
66 this bill instead prohibits any deputy constable from being appointed unless he or
67 she is so certified.
68 Existing law requires a constable or deputy constable who is authorized to carry
69 a firearm to receive training approved by the Commission in the use of firearms at
70 least once every 6 months. (NRS 258.070) Section 15 of this bill requires such
71 training to include any continuing education that addresses firearms and is required
72 for a category II officer, including, without limitation, any requirements concerning
73 the demonstration of a minimum level of proficiency in the use of firearms.
74 Section 15 further prohibits, with certain exceptions, a constable from
75 executing any writ, warrant or other order of a court in a criminal case unless the
76 writ, warrant or order is delivered to the constable for execution by certain
77 appropriate persons.
78 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county which
79 includes only one township to, by resolution, appoint the sheriff ex officio
80 constable to serve without additional compensation. Additionally, if a board of
81 county commissioners in a county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently
82 all counties other than Clark County) which includes more than one township or a
83 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County)
84 determines that the office of constable is not necessary in one or more townships,
85 existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to abolish the office of
86 constable in a township and to appoint the sheriff ex officio constable. (NRS
87 258.010) Section 12 of this bill instead authorizes a board of county commissioners
88 in any county which includes more than one township to take such actions under
89 such circumstances.
90 Existing law authorizes a constable to perform, with respect to certain
91 provisions concerning writs of execution, garnishment and attachment, any of the
92 duties assigned to a sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority
93 granted to a sheriff with respect to such provisions. (NRS 21.111, 31.235) Sections
94 18 and 20 of this bill instead provide that for certain provisions concerning
95 remedies, including writs of attachment, garnishment and arrest and bail, as well as
96 certain provisions concerning the enforcement of certain judgments including writs
97 of execution or garnishment, a constable is authorized to perform any of the duties
98 assigned to a sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority granted
99 to a sheriff with respect to any process, writ or order in a civil case.
100 Existing law authorizes execution on a writ of garnishment to occur only if the
101 sheriff mails a copy of the writ with a copy of the notice of execution to the
102 defendant in a certain manner and provides that, in the case of a writ of
103 garnishment that continues for 180 days or until the amount demanded in the writ is
104 satisfied, a copy of the writ and the notice of execution need only be mailed once to
105 the defendant. (NRS 31.260) Section 21 of this bill instead: (1) requires the sheriff
106 to mail a copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of execution with the copy of
107 the notice of execution; and (2) provides that in the case of a writ of garnishment
108 that continues for 180 days or until the amount demanded in the writ is satisfied, a
109 copy of the writ of execution and the notice of execution need only be mailed once
110 to the defendant.
111 Existing law requires, when six or more persons are unlawfully or riotously
112 assembled in any town, the sheriff of the county and the sheriff’s deputies or the
113 constable of the town and the justice of the peace to: (1) go among the persons so
114 assembled and command such persons in the name of the people of the United
-
*SB381_R1*

– 4 –
115 States and the State of Nevada to disperse immediately; and (2) if such persons do
116 not disperse, arrest them. Further, existing law provides that a magistrate or officer
117 who neglects or refuses to proceed to the place of assembly and exercise such
118 powers is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 269.230) Section 22 of this bill: (1)
119 removes such a duty from a magistrate or constable; (2) places such a duty upon the
120 chief of police or his or her peace officers; and (3) instead requires such a command
121 to only be given in the name of the people of the State of Nevada.
122 Existing law authorizes a magistrate to depute in writing any suitable and
123 discreet person to act as constable when no constable is at hand and the nature of
124 the business requires immediate action. (NRS 171.116) Existing law additionally
125 provides that any constable who willfully refuses to arrest any person charged with
126 a criminal offense is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and requires such a constable to
127 be removed from office. (NRS 258.110) Section 27 repeals such provisions.

35 deadly force by the constable and each deputy constable; and
36 (b) The constable and each deputy constable has received
37 training regarding the policy.
38 4. A constable or deputy constable authorized to carry a
39 firearm pursuant to subsection 3 must receive training approved by
40 the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission in the use
41 of firearms at least once every 6 months. This training must include
42 any continuing education that addresses firearms and is required
43 for a category II peace officer by the standards established by the
44 Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission pursuant to
45 subsection 2 of NRS 289.510, including, without limitation, any
-
*SB381_R1*

– 11 –
1 requirements concerning the demonstration of a minimum level of
2 proficiency in the use of firearms.
3 5. A constable or deputy constable who wears a uniform in the
4 performance of his or her duties shall display prominently as part of
5 that uniform a badge, nameplate or other uniform piece which
6 clearly displays the name or an identification number of the
7 constable or deputy constable.
8 6. Pursuant to the procedures and subject to the limitations set
9 forth in chapters 482 and 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, a
10 constable may issue a citation to an owner or driver, as appropriate,
11 of a vehicle which is located in his or her township at the time the
12 citation is issued and which is required to be registered in this State
13 if the constable determines that the vehicle is not properly
14 registered. Upon the imposition of punishment pursuant to NRS
15 482.385 on the person to whom the citation is issued, the constable
16 is entitled to charge and collect a fee of $100 from the person to
17 whom the citation is issued, which:
18 (a) Must be collected by a court that imposes punishment
19 pursuant to NRS 482.385 on behalf of the constable who issued the
20 citation and forwarded by the court to the constable; and
21 (b) May be retained by the constable as compensation.
22 7. If a sheriff or the sheriff’s deputy in any county in this State
23 arrests a person charged with a criminal offense or in the
24 commission of an offense, the sheriff or the sheriff’s deputy shall
25 serve all process, whether mesne or final, and attend the court
26 executing the order thereof in the prosecution of the person so
27 arrested, whether in a justice court or a district court, to the
28 conclusion, and whether the offense is an offense of which a justice
29 of the peace has jurisdiction, or whether the proceeding is a
30 preliminary examination or hearing. The sheriff or the sheriff’s
31 deputy shall collect the same fees and in the same manner therefor
32 as the constable of the township in which the justice court is held
33 would receive for the same service.
34 8. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or by
35 specific statute, a constable shall not enforce any writ, warrant or
36 other order of a court in a criminal case unless the writ, warrant
37 or order is delivered to the constable for execution by the Attorney
38 General, a district attorney, a sheriff or other appropriate person.
39 Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a constable may
40 execute a warrant for arrest which is issued for a failure to appear
41 if the constable or deputy of the constable previously issued the
42 citation which is the subject of the case to the person who is the
43 subject of the warrant.

1 Sec. 18. NRS 21.111 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 21.111 A constable may perform any of the duties assigned to
3 a sheriff and has all of the authority granted to a sheriff pursuant to
4 this chapter with respect to [a] any process, writ [of execution] or
5 [garnishment.] order in a civil case.
6 Sec. 19. NRS 21.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 21.150 1. All sales of property under execution must be made
8 at auction to the highest bidder between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5
9 p.m. [All] Except as otherwise provided by subsection 7, sales of
10 real property must be made at the courthouse of the county in which
11 the property or some part thereof is situated.
12 2. After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the
13 execution, more property must not be sold.
14 3. The officer holding the execution and the officer’s deputy
15 shall not become a purchaser or be interested in any purchase at
16 such sale.
17 4. When the sale is of personal property capable of manual
18 delivery, it shall be in view of those who attend the sale and be sold
19 in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price.
20 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, when the sale
21 is of real property and consisting of several known lots or parcels,
22 they shall be sold separately, or when a portion of such real property
23 is claimed by a third person and the third party requires it to be sold
24 separately, such portion shall be thus sold. If the land to be sold
25 under execution consists of a single parcel, or two or more
26 contiguous parcels, situated in two or more counties, notice of the
27 sale must be posted and published in each of such counties, as
28 provided in this chapter. The judgment debtor, if present at the sale,
29 may also direct the order in which property, real or personal, shall
30 be sold. When such property consists of several known lots or
31 parcels, or of articles which can be sold to advantage separately, the
32 sheriff shall be bound to follow such directions.
33 6. The provisions of subsection 5 do not apply to a sale
34 pursuant to NRS 40.430.
35 7. If a sheriff or constable enters into a contract with an
36 operator of an online auction for real property pursuant to section
37 3 or 8 of this act, respectively, sales of real property conducted
38 pursuant to this section may be conducted by an auction on the
39 Internet website of the operator or by other electronic means. As
40 used in this subsection, “operator of an online auction for real
41 property” has the meaning ascribed to it in section 3 of this act.
42 Sec. 20. NRS 31.235 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 31.235 A constable may perform any of the duties assigned to
44 a sheriff and has all of the authority granted to a sheriff pursuant to

– 13 –
1 this chapter with respect to [a] any process, writ [of attachment.] or
2 order in a civil case.
3 Sec. 21. NRS 31.260 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 31.260 1. The writ of garnishment must:
5 (a) Be issued by the sheriff.
6 (b) Contain the name of the court and the names of the parties.
7 (c) Be directed to the garnishee defendant.
8 (d) State the name and address of the plaintiff’s attorney, if any,

11 submit to the sheriff an answer to the interrogatories within 20 days
12 after service of the writ upon the person.
13 2. The writ of garnishment must also notify the garnishee
14 defendant that, if the garnishee defendant fails to answer the
15 interrogatories, a judgment by default will be rendered against the
16 garnishee defendant for:
17 (a) The amount demanded in the writ of garnishment or the
18 value of the property described in the writ, as the case may be; or
19 (b) If the garnishment is pursuant to NRS 31.291, the amount of
20 the lien created pursuant to that section,
21  which amount or property must be clearly set forth in the writ of
22 garnishment.
23 3. Execution on the writ of garnishment may occur only if the
24 sheriff mails a copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of
25 execution with a copy of the notice of execution to the defendant in
26 the manner and within the time prescribed in NRS 21.076. In the
27 case of a writ of garnishment that continues for 180 days or until the
28 amount demanded in the writ is satisfied, a copy of the writ of
29 execution and the notice of execution need only be mailed once to
30 the defendant.
31 Sec. 22. NRS 269.230 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 269.230 1. When six or more persons, whether armed or not,
33 shall be unlawfully or riotously assembled in any town, the sheriff
34 of the county [and the sheriff’s] or his or her deputies [,] or the
35 [constable of the town, and the justice of the peace] chief of police
36 of the city or his or her peace officers, as applicable, shall go
37 among the persons so assembled, or as near as possible, and shall
38 command them, in the name of the people of [the United States and]
39 the State of Nevada, to disperse immediately.
40 2. If the persons assembled do not immediately disperse, the
41 [magistrates and] officers shall arrest them, that they be punished
42 according to law, and for that purpose may command the aid of all
43 persons present or within the county.
44 3. If [a magistrate or] an officer, having notice of an unlawful
45 or riotous assembly, as provided in subsection 1, [neglect] neglects
-
*SB381_R1*

– 14 –
1 or [refuse] refuses to proceed to the place of assembly, or as near
2 thereto as the [magistrate or] officer can with safety, and to exercise
3 the authority with which the [magistrate or] officer is invested for
4 suppressing the same and arresting the offenders, the [magistrate or]
5 officer shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be
6 punished accordingly.
7 Sec. 23. (Deleted by amendment.)
8 Sec. 24. (Deleted by amendment.)
9 Sec. 25. NRS 648.014 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 648.014 “Process server” means a person, other than a peace
11 officer of the State of Nevada [,] or a civil enforcement officer who
12 is appointed pursuant to section 2 or 7 of this act, who engages in
13 the business of serving legal process within this State.
14 Sec. 26. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
15 additional expenses of a local government that are related to the
16 provisions of this act.
17 Sec. 27. NRS 31.920, 171.116 and 258.110 are hereby
18 repealed.
