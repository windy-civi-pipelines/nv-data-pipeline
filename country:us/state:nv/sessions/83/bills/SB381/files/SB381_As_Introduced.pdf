Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a sheriff to appoint one or more deputies who are
2 authorized to perform all the duties devolving on the sheriff of the county and such
3 other duties as the sheriff may from time to time direct. (NRS 248.040) Section 2
-
*SB381*

– 2 –
4 of this bill authorizes a sheriff to appoint civil enforcement officers who are
5 authorized to perform certain duties of the sheriff relating to the service, posting
6 and enforcement of certain notices and writs. Section 7 of this bill similarly
7 authorizes a constable to appoint such officers. Section 25 of this bill provides that
8 a civil enforcement officer is not governed by certain provisions set forth in
9 existing law for the licensure and regulation of process servers who are not peace
10 officers. (NRS 648.014)
11 Existing law further provides that a person who is employed as clerical or
12 operational staff of a constable does not have the powers of a peace officer and
13 prohibits such a person from possessing or carrying a weapon or concealed firearm
14 while performing his or her official duties. (NRS 258.065) Section 9 of this bill
15 makes such provisions, with certain exceptions, applicable to any person who
16 works under the direction and supervision of a constable, including, without
17 limitation, an appointee, employee, contractor or volunteer of the constable and
18 removes the prohibition for such persons to possess or carry a weapon while
19 performing his or her official duties. Section 14 of this bill removes language made
20 duplicative by the provisions of section 9.
21 Existing law requires all sales of property under execution to be made at
22 auction to the highest bidder and requires such an auction to take place between the
23 hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. at the courthouse of the county in which the property or
24 some part thereof is situated. (NRS 21.150) Section 19 of this bill authorizes such a
25 sale of real property to be conducted on the Internet website of an operator of an
26 online auction for real property or other electronic means. Sections 3 and 8 of this
27 bill authorize a sheriff and constable, respectively, to enter into a contract with such
28 an operator to sell the property by an auction conducted on the Internet website of
29 the operator or other electronic means.
30 Existing law requires a sheriff to take property which is the subject of a claim
31 to delivery and described in a writ of possession if it is in the possession of a
32 defendant or an agent of the defendant and retain it in his or her custody. (NRS
33 31.840, 31.870) If the property, or any part of the property, is concealed in a
34 building or enclosure, existing law requires the sheriff to publicly demand delivery
35 of the property. If the property is not delivered, existing law requires the sheriff to
36 cause the building or enclosure to be broken open and to take the property and
37 authorizes, if necessary, the sheriff to call the power of the sheriff’s county to his or
38 her aid. (NRS 31.920) Sections 4 and 10 of this bill provide that a sheriff or
39 constable is subject to such requirements after the receipt of any writ or order that
40 directs the sheriff or constable to take the property described in it. Section 27 of
41 this bill repeals a provision concerning writs of possession which is made
42 duplicative by the provisions of sections 4 and 10.
43 Existing law authorizes the sheriff of each county in this State to charge and
44 collect certain fees for certain services provided by the sheriff. (NRS 248.275)
45 Section 5 of this bill revises such fees. Section 16 of this bill similarly revises the
46 fees that a constable is entitled to for certain services provided by the constable.
47 (NRS 258.125) Section 15 of this bill makes conforming changes to remove
48 references to provisions that were relocated to sections 5 and 16. Sections 17, 23
49 and 24 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the renumbering and
50 relocation of certain fees.
51 Section 11 of this bill removes a requirement for each constable of a township
52 whose population is 15,000 or more, or a township that has within its boundaries a
53 city whose population is 15,000 or more, to become certified by the Peace Officers’
54 Standards and Training Commission as a category I or category II peace officer
55 within 1 year after the date on which the constable commences his or her term of
56 office or appointment.
57 Existing law: (1) requires any person who is a candidate for the office of
58 constable in a township whose population is 100,000 or more to be certified by the
-
*SB381*

– 3 –
59 Commission as a category I or category II peace officer before filing a declaration
60 of candidacy for the office; and (2) provides that a constable forfeits his or her
61 office if he or she does not maintain such a certification. (NRS 258.007) Section 11
62 instead: (1) requires that a person who is a candidate for the office of constable in a
63 township whose population is 100,000 or more in a county whose population is
64 100,000 or more to be certified by the Commission as a category I or category II
65 peace officer before filing a declaration of candidacy for the office; and (2)
66 provides that a constable forfeits his or her office if he does not maintain such a
67 certification.
68 Existing law authorizes a constable to appoint deputies who are authorized to
69 transact all official business pertaining to the office to the same extent as their
70 principals and sets forth certain requirements for such a position, including a
71 requirement for a person who is appointed as a deputy constable in certain
72 townships to be certified by the Commission as a category I or category II peace
73 officer before commencing his or her employment. (NRS 258.060) Section 13 of
74 this bill instead prohibits any deputy constable from being appointed unless he or
75 she is so certified.
76 Existing law requires a constable or deputy constable who is authorized to carry
77 a firearm to receive training approved by the Commission in the use of firearms at
78 least once every 6 months. (NRS 258.070) Section 15 requires such training to
79 include any continuing education that addresses firearms and is required for a
80 category II officer, including, without limitation, any requirements concerning the
81 demonstration of a minimum level of proficiency in the use of firearms.
82 Section 15 further prohibits, with certain exceptions, a constable from
83 executing any writ, warrant or other order of a court in a criminal case unless the
84 writ, warrant or order is delivered to the constable for execution by certain
85 appropriate persons.
86 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners in a county which
87 includes only one township to, by resolution, appoint the sheriff ex officio
88 constable to serve without additional compensation. Additionally, if a board of
89 county commissioners in a county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently
90 all counties other than Clark County) which includes more than one township or a
91 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County)
92 determines that the office of constable is not necessary in one or more townships,
93 existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to abolish the office of
94 constable in a township and to appoint the sheriff ex officio constable. (NRS
95 258.010) Section 12 of this bill instead authorizes a board of county commissioners
96 in any county which includes more than one township to take such actions under
97 such circumstances.
98 Existing law authorizes a constable to perform, with respect to certain
99 provisions concerning writs of execution, garnishment and attachment, any of the
100 duties assigned to a sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority
101 granted to a sheriff with respect to such provisions. (NRS 21.111, 31.235) Sections
102 18 and 20 of this bill instead provide that for certain provisions concerning
103 remedies, including writs of attachment, garnishment and arrest and bail, as well as
104 certain provisions concerning the enforcement of certain judgments including writs
105 of execution or garnishment, a constable is authorized to perform any of the duties
106 assigned to a sheriff and provides that the constable has all of the authority granted
107 to a sheriff with respect to any process, writ or order in a civil case.
108 Existing law authorizes execution on a writ of garnishment to occur only if the
109 sheriff mails a copy of the writ with a copy of the notice of execution to the
110 defendant in a certain manner and provides that, in the case of a writ of
111 garnishment that continues for 180 days or until the amount demanded in the writ is
112 satisfied, a copy of the writ and the notice of execution need only be mailed once to
113 the defendant. (NRS 31.260) Section 21 of this bill instead: (1) requires the sheriff
-
*SB381*

– 4 –
114 to mail a copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of execution with the copy of
115 the notice of execution; and (2) provides that in the case of a writ of garnishment
116 that continues for 180 days or until the amount demanded in the writ is satisfied, a
117 copy of the writ of execution and the notice of execution need only be mailed once
118 to the defendant.
119 Existing law requires, when six or more persons are unlawfully or riotously
120 assembled in any town, the sheriff of the county and the sheriff’s deputies or the
121 constable of the town and the justice of the peace to: (1) go among the persons so
122 assembled and command such persons in the name of the people of the United
123 States and the State of Nevada, to disperse immediately; and (2) if such persons do
124 not disperse, arrest them. Further, existing law provides that a magistrate or officer
125 who neglects or refuses to proceed to the place of assembly and exercise such
126 powers is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 269.230) Section 22 of this bill: (1)
127 removes such a duty from a magistrate or constable; (2) places such a duty upon the
128 chief of police or his or her peace officers; and (3) instead requires such a command
129 to only be given in the name of the people of the State of Nevada.
130 Existing law authorizes a magistrate to depute in writing any suitable and
131 discreet person to act as constable when no constable is at hand and the nature of
132 the business requires immediate action. (NRS 171.116) Existing law additionally
133 provides that any constable who willfully refuses to arrest any person charged with
134 a criminal offense is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and requires such a constable to
135 be removed from office. (NRS 258.110) Section 27 repeals such provisions.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

26 property.

8 officers, who are authorized to transact the business described in

– 22 –
1 (e) Require each person the court directs, as garnishees, to
2 submit to the sheriff an answer to the interrogatories within 20 days
3 after service of the writ upon the person.
4 2. The writ of garnishment must also notify the garnishee
5 defendant that, if the garnishee defendant fails to answer the
6 interrogatories, a judgment by default will be rendered against the
7 garnishee defendant for:
8 (a) The amount demanded in the writ of garnishment or the
9 value of the property described in the writ, as the case may be; or
10 (b) If the garnishment is pursuant to NRS 31.291, the amount of
11 the lien created pursuant to that section,
12  which amount or property must be clearly set forth in the writ of
13 garnishment.

15 sheriff mails a copy of the writ of garnishment and the writ of
16 execution with a copy of the notice of execution to the defendant in

20 execution and the notice of execution need only be mailed once to
21 the defendant.

32 [magistrates and] officers shall arrest them, that they be punished
33 according to law, and for that purpose may command the aid of all
34 persons present or within the county.
35 3. If [a magistrate or] an officer, having notice of an unlawful
36 or riotous assembly, as provided in subsection 1, [neglect] neglects
37 or [refuse] refuses to proceed to the place of assembly, or as near
38 thereto as the [magistrate or] officer can with safety, and to exercise
39 the authority with which the [magistrate or] officer is invested for

14 (b) If the owner of the abandoned vehicle cannot be identified or
15 if the automobile wrecker is otherwise unable to collect from the
16 owner the fee described in paragraph (d) of subsection [2] 1 of NRS
17 258.125, transmit that fee to the constable only if the automobile
18 wrecker is able to satisfy his or her own lien, as provided in
19 NRS 487.270.
20 Sec. 24. NRS 487.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:

5 wrecker or operator of a tow car may request that the Department
6 issue an unbranded title for the vehicle. The Department shall issue

25 highways of this State.

29 salvage vehicle or rebuilt vehicle.
30 6. If the vehicle was removed from public property at the
31 request of a constable and the owner of the garage or automobile
32 wrecker satisfies his or her lien pursuant to subsection 2 or 3, the
