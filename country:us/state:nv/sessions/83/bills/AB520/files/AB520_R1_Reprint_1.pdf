AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations
of certain persons who operate or provide services to
children at a child-placing agency; requiring the
maintenance of certain records of such background
investigations; authorizing the disclosure of information
from the State Register for Adoptions to certain persons
without the consent of the natural parent under
extenuating circumstances; authorizing certain persons to
attend an adoption hearing by a remote technology system
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in
2 certain homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a
3 background investigation; (2) prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain
4 crimes from working or residing in such a home or facility; and (3) requires certain
5 homes and facilities to maintain records of background investigations. (NRS
6 62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755, 433B.183-433B.187,
7 449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a nonprofit
8 corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS
9 127.220) Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a
10 child-placing agency or an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a
11 child-placing agency to undergo a background investigation; and (2) prohibit the
12 director of adoption of a child-placing agency from allowing a person to provide
-

– 2 –
13 services to children if the Division of Child and Family Services has, based on the
14 criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be unacceptable to provide
15 services to children. (NAC 127.140)
16 Sections 2-5 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-placing
17 agencies into existing law similarly to the manner in which the requirements
18 governing background investigations of the personnel of other homes or facilities
19 that provide services to children are codified; and (2) additionally require such
20 background investigations to be conducted every 5 years. Specifically, section 2
21 requires the Division to: (1) investigate the background and personal history of
22 every initial applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency and every
23 employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency; and (2)
24 repeat such investigations every 5 years. Sections 3 and 11 of this bill prescribe the
25 procedure for conducting such an investigation. Section 3 authorizes the Division
26 to deny an application for a license to operate a child-placing agency or suspend or
27 revoke such a license if the Division determines that the applicant or licensee, as
28 applicable: (1) has a substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the
29 person unacceptable to provide services to children; or (2) has allowed an
30 employee, volunteer or independent contractor who has such a history or has not
31 undergone such a background investigation to provide services to children. Section
32 4 prohibits an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing
33 agency from providing services to children under such circumstances. Section 4
34 also requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency or the
35 holder of such a license to give an employee, independent contractor or volunteer
36 who believes that the information resulting from an investigation of his or her
37 background and criminal history is incorrect 30 days to correct the information.
38 Section 2 requires the Division to prescribe by regulation the conditions under
39 which the Division may deem a person to have a substantiated history of
40 maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to provide services to
41 children. Section 5 requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing
42 agency or the holder of such a license to maintain records of certain information
43 relating to background investigations of employees, volunteers and independent
44 contractors and make such records available to the Division upon request. Sections
45 7 and 9 of this bill prohibit a court from entering an order of adoption and declare
46 any order of adoption so entered to be void if the adoption was facilitated by a
47 child-placing agency that has failed to comply with sections 2-5. Section 10 of this
48 bill makes certain definitions applicable to sections 2-5.
49 Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions
50 to provide information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of
51 such adults. Existing law authorizes the Division to release certain information
52 from the State Register to adopted persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural
53 parent of the adopted person has consented to the release; and (2) the adopted
54 person has not requested to restrict the release of the information. (NRS 127.007)
55 Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information without the
56 written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
57 circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
58 Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court
59 hearing concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the
60 prospective adoptive parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child
61 who is the subject of the hearing is in the custody of an agency which provides
62 child welfare services or a child-placing agency; and (3) a representative of the
63 agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where the child will be
64 placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
65 additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of
66 the agency responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing
-
