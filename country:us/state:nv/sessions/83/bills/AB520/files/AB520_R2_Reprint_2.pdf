EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations
of certain persons who operate or provide services to
children at a child-placing agency; authorizing the
disclosure of information from the State Register for
Adoptions to certain persons without the consent of the
natural parent under extenuating circumstances;
authorizing certain persons to attend an adoption hearing
by a remote-technology system under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in
2 certain homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a
3 background investigation; (2) prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain
4 crimes from working or residing in such a home or facility; and (3) requires certain
5 homes and facilities to maintain records of background investigations. (NRS
6 62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755, 433B.183-433B.187,
7 449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a nonprofit
8 corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS
9 127.220) Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a
10 child-placing agency or an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a
11 child-placing agency to undergo a background investigation; and (2) prohibit the
12 director of adoption of a child-placing agency from allowing a person to provide
13 services to children if the Division of Child and Family Services has, based on the
-
*AB520_R2*

– 2 –
14 criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be unacceptable to provide
15 services to children. (NAC 127.140)
16 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-
17 placing agencies into existing law; and (2) additionally require such background
18 investigations to be conducted every 5 years. Specifically, section 2 requires the
19 Division to: (1) investigate the background and personal history of every initial
20 applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency and every employee,
21 volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency; and (2) repeat such
22 investigations every 5 years. Section 3 requires an applicant for a license to operate
23 a child-placing agency and every employee, volunteer or independent contractor of
24 the child-placing agency, for the purposes of an investigation pursuant to section 2,
25 to submit to the Division: (1) a complete set of fingerprints; and (2) written
26 permission authorizing the fingerprints to be submitted to the Federal Bureau of
27 Investigation for a background check. Section 11 of this bill makes conforming
28 changes to require the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History
29 to conduct such background checks. Section 2 requires the Division to prescribe by
30 regulation the conditions under which the Division may deem a person to have a
31 substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to
32 provide services to children. Section 7 of this bill prohibits a court from entering an
33 order of adoption and declare any order of adoption so entered to be void if the
34 adoption was facilitated by a child-placing agency that has failed to comply with
35 sections 2 and 3. Section 9 of this bill indicates the proper placement of sections 2
36 and 3 in NRS. Section 10 of this bill makes certain definitions applicable to
37 sections 2 and 3.
38 Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions
39 to provide information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of
40 such adults. Existing law authorizes the Division to release certain information
41 from the State Register to adopted persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural
42 parent of the adopted person has consented to the release; and (2) the adopted
43 person has not requested to restrict the release of the information. (NRS 127.007)
44 Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information without the
45 written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
46 circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
47 Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court
48 hearing concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the
49 prospective adoptive parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child
50 who is the subject of the hearing is in the custody of an agency which provides
51 child welfare services or a child-placing agency; and (3) a representative of the
52 agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where the child will be
53 placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
54 additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of
55 the agency responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing
56 concerning the adoption by any other remote-technology system under such
57 circumstances.
