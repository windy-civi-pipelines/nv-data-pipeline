CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations
of certain persons who operate or provide services to children
at a child-placing agency; authorizing the disclosure of
information from the State Register for Adoptions to certain
persons without the consent of the natural parent under
extenuating circumstances; authorizing certain persons to
attend an adoption hearing by a remote-technology system
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in
certain homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a
background investigation; (2) prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain
crimes from working or residing in such a home or facility; and (3) requires certain
homes and facilities to maintain records of background investigations. (NRS
62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755, 433B.183-433B.187,

Section 2:
449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a nonprofit
corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS

Section 3:
127.220) Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a
child-placing agency or an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a
child-placing agency to undergo a background investigation; and (2) prohibit the
director of adoption of a child-placing agency from allowing a person to provide
services to children if the Division of Child and Family Services has, based on the
criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be unacceptable to provide
services to children. (NAC 127.140)

Section 4:
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-
placing agencies into existing law; and (2) additionally require such background
investigations to be conducted every 5 years. Specifically, section 2 requires the
Division to: (1) investigate the background and personal history of every initial
applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency and every employee,
volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency; and (2) repeat such
investigations every 5 years. Section 3 requires an applicant for a license to operate
a child-placing agency and every employee, volunteer or independent contractor of
the child-placing agency, for the purposes of an investigation pursuant to section 2,
to submit to the Division: (1) a complete set of fingerprints; and (2) written
permission authorizing the fingerprints to be submitted to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for a background check. Section 11 of this bill makes conforming
changes to require the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History
to conduct such background checks. Section 2 requires the Division to prescribe by
regulation the conditions under which the Division may deem a person to have a
substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to
provide services to children. Section 7 of this bill prohibits a court from entering an
order of adoption and declare any order of adoption so entered to be void if the
adoption was facilitated by a child-placing agency that has failed to comply with

Section 5:
sections 2 and 3. Section 9 of this bill indicates the proper placement of sections 2
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
and 3 in NRS. Section 10 of this bill makes certain definitions applicable to

Section 6:
sections 2 and 3.
Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions
to provide information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of
such adults. Existing law authorizes the Division to release certain information
from the State Register to adopted persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural
parent of the adopted person has consented to the release; and (2) the adopted
person has not requested to restrict the release of the information. (NRS 127.007)

Section 7:
Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information without the
written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court
hearing concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the
prospective adoptive parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child
who is the subject of the hearing is in the custody of an agency which provides
child welfare services or a child-placing agency; and (3) a representative of the
agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where the child will be
placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of
the agency responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing
concerning the adoption by any other remote-technology system under such
circumstances.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 520–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations
of certain persons who operate or provide services to children
at a child-placing agency; authorizing the disclosure of
information from the State Register for Adoptions to certain
persons without the consent of the natural parent under
extenuating circumstances; authorizing certain persons to
attend an adoption hearing by a remote-technology system
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in
certain homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a
background investigation; (2) prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain
crimes from working or residing in such a home or facility; and (3) requires certain
homes and facilities to maintain records of background investigations. (NRS
62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755, 433B.183-433B.187,
449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a nonprofit
corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS
127.220) Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a
child-placing agency or an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a
child-placing agency to undergo a background investigation; and (2) prohibit the
director of adoption of a child-placing agency from allowing a person to provide
services to children if the Division of Child and Family Services has, based on the
criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be unacceptable to provide
services to children. (NAC 127.140)
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-
placing agencies into existing law; and (2) additionally require such background
investigations to be conducted every 5 years. Specifically, section 2 requires the
Division to: (1) investigate the background and personal history of every initial
applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency and every employee,
volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency; and (2) repeat such
investigations every 5 years. Section 3 requires an applicant for a license to operate
a child-placing agency and every employee, volunteer or independent contractor of
the child-placing agency, for the purposes of an investigation pursuant to section 2,
to submit to the Division: (1) a complete set of fingerprints; and (2) written
permission authorizing the fingerprints to be submitted to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for a background check. Section 11 of this bill makes conforming
changes to require the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History
to conduct such background checks. Section 2 requires the Division to prescribe by
regulation the conditions under which the Division may deem a person to have a
substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to
provide services to children. Section 7 of this bill prohibits a court from entering an
order of adoption and declare any order of adoption so entered to be void if the
adoption was facilitated by a child-placing agency that has failed to comply with
sections 2 and 3. Section 9 of this bill indicates the proper placement of sections 2
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
and 3 in NRS. Section 10 of this bill makes certain definitions applicable to
sections 2 and 3.
Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions
to provide information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of
such adults. Existing law authorizes the Division to release certain information
from the State Register to adopted persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural
parent of the adopted person has consented to the release; and (2) the adopted
person has not requested to restrict the release of the information. (NRS 127.007)
Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information without the
written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court
hearing concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the
prospective adoptive parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child
who is the subject of the hearing is in the custody of an agency which provides
child welfare services or a child-placing agency; and (3) a representative of the
agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where the child will be
placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of
the agency responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing
concerning the adoption by any other remote-technology system under such
circumstances.
