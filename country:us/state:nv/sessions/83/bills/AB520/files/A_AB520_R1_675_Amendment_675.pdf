EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations of certain
persons who operate or provide services to children at a child-placing
agency; [requiring the maintenance of certain records of such
background investigations;] authorizing the disclosure of information
from the State Register for Adoptions to certain persons without the
consent of the natural parent under extenuating circumstances;
authorizing certain persons to attend an adoption hearing by a remote-
technology system under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in certain
2 homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a background investigation; (2)
3 prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain crimes from working or residing in such
4 a home or facility; and (3) requires certain homes and facilities to maintain records of
5 background investigations. (NRS 62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755,
6 433B.183-433B.187, 449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a
7 nonprofit corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS 127.220)
8 Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency or
9 an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency to undergo a
10 background investigation; and (2) prohibit the director of adoption of a child-placing agency
11 from allowing a person to provide services to children if the Division of Child and Family
12 Services has, based on the criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be
13 unacceptable to provide services to children. (NAC 127.140)
14 Sections [2-5] 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-placing
15 agencies into existing law ; [similarly to the manner in which the requirements governing
16 background investigations of the personnel of other homes or facilities that provide services to
17 children are codified;] and (2) additionally require such background investigations to be
18 conducted every 5 years. Specifically, section 2 requires the Division to: (1) investigate the
19 background and personal history of every initial applicant for a license to operate a child-
20 placing agency and every employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing

Senate Amendment No. 675 to Assembly Bill No. 520 First Reprint Page 4
21 agency; and (2) repeat such investigations every 5 years. [Sections] Section 3 [and 11 of this
22 bill prescribe the procedure for conducting such an investigation. Section 3 authorizes the
23 Division to deny an application for a license to operate a child-placing agency or suspend or
24 revoke such a license if the Division determines that the applicant or licensee, as applicable:
25 (1) has a substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to
26 provide services to children; or (2) has allowed an employee, volunteer or independent
27 contractor who has such a history or has not undergone such a background investigation to
28 provide services to children. Section 4 prohibits an employee, volunteer or independent
29 contractor of a child-placing agency from providing services to children under such
30 circumstances. Section 4 also] requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing
31 agency [or the holder of such a license to give an employee, independent contractor or
32 volunteer who believes that the information resulting from an investigation of his or her
33 background and criminal history is incorrect 30 days to correct the information.] and every
34 employee, volunteer or independent contractor of the child-placing agency, for the
35 purposes of an investigation pursuant to section 2, to submit to the Division: (1) a
36 complete set of fingerprints; and (2) written permission authorizing the fingerprints to
37 be submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a background check. Section 11
38 of this bill makes conforming changes to require the Central Repository for Nevada
39 Records of Criminal History to conduct such background checks. Section 2 requires the
40 Division to prescribe by regulation the conditions under which the Division may deem a
41 person to have a substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person
42 unacceptable to provide services to children. [Section 5 requires an applicant for a license to
43 operate a child-placing agency or the holder of such a license to maintain records of certain
44 information relating to background investigations of employees, volunteers and independent
45 contractors and make such records available to the Division upon request. Sections] Section 7
46 [and 9] of this bill [prohibit] prohibits a court from entering an order of adoption and declare
47 any order of adoption so entered to be void if the adoption was facilitated by a child-placing
48 agency that has failed to comply with sections [2-5.] 2 and 3. Section 9 of this bill indicates
49 the proper placement of sections 2 and 3 in NRS. Section 10 of this bill makes certain
50 definitions applicable to sections [2-5.] 2 and 3.
51 Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions to provide
52 information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of such adults. Existing
53 law authorizes the Division to release certain information from the State Register to adopted
54 persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural parent of the adopted person has consented to the
55 release; and (2) the adopted person has not requested to restrict the release of the information.
56 (NRS 127.007) Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information
57 without the written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
58 circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
59 Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court hearing
60 concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the prospective adoptive
61 parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child who is the subject of the hearing is
62 in the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services or a child-placing agency;
63 and (3) a representative of the agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where
64 the child will be placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
65 additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of the agency
66 responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing concerning the adoption by any
67 other remote-technology system under such circumstances.
