SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to adoption. (BDR 11-356)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations of certain
persons who operate or provide services to children at a child-placing
agency; requiring the maintenance of certain records of such
background investigations; authorizing the disclosure of information
from the State Register for Adoptions to certain persons without the
consent of the natural parent under extenuating circumstances;
authorizing certain persons to attend an adoption hearing by a remote
technology system under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in certain
2 homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a background investigation; (2)
3 prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain crimes from working or residing in such
4 a home or facility; and (3) requires certain homes and facilities to maintain records of
5 background investigations. (NRS 62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755,
6 433B.183-433B.187, 449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a
7 nonprofit corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS 127.220)
8 Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency or
9 an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency to undergo a
10 background investigation; and (2) prohibit the director of adoption of a child-placing agency
11 from allowing a person to provide services to children if the Division of Child and Family
12 Services has, based on the criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be
13 unacceptable to provide services to children. (NAC 127.140)
14 Sections 2-5 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-placing agencies
15 into existing law similarly to the manner in which the requirements governing background
16 investigations of the personnel of other homes or facilities that provide services to children are
17 codified; and (2) additionally require such background investigations to be conducted every 5
18 years. Specifically, section 2 requires the Division to: (1) investigate the background and
19 personal history of every initial applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency and
20 every employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency; and (2) repeat
Assembly Amendment No. 458 to Assembly Bill No. 520 Page 4
21 such investigations every 5 years. Sections 3 and 11 of this bill prescribe the procedure for
22 conducting such an investigation. Section 3 authorizes the Division to deny an application for
23 a license to operate a child-placing agency or suspend or revoke such a license if the Division
24 determines that the applicant or licensee, as applicable: (1) has a [criminal] substantiated
25 history [or a history of child abuse and neglect] of maltreating a child that renders the person
26 unacceptable to provide services to children; or (2) has allowed an employee, volunteer or
27 independent contractor who has such a history or has not undergone such a background
28 investigation to provide services to children. Section 4 prohibits an employee, volunteer or
29 independent contractor of a child-placing agency from providing services to children under
30 such circumstances. Section 4 also requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-
31 placing agency or the holder of such a license to give an employee, independent contractor or
32 volunteer who believes that the information resulting from an investigation of his or her
33 background and criminal history is incorrect 30 days to correct the information. Section 2
34 requires the Division to prescribe by regulation the conditions under which the Division may
35 deem a person to have a [criminal history or a history of child abuse and neglect]
36 substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to provide
37 services to children. Section 5 requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing
38 agency or the holder of such a license to maintain records of certain information relating to
39 background investigations of employees, volunteers and independent contractors and make
40 such records available to the Division upon request. Sections 7 and 9 of this bill prohibit a
41 court from entering an order of adoption and declare any order of adoption so entered to be
42 void if the adoption was facilitated by a child-placing agency that has failed to comply with
43 sections 2-5. Section 10 of this bill makes certain definitions applicable to sections 2-5.
44 Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions to provide
45 information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of such adults. Existing
46 law authorizes the Division to release certain information from the State Register to adopted
47 persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural parent of the adopted person has consented to the
48 release; and (2) the adopted person has not requested to restrict the release of the information.
49 (NRS 127.007) Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information
50 without the written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
51 circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
52 Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court hearing
53 concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the prospective adoptive
54 parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child who is the subject of the hearing is
55 in the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services or a child-placing agency;
56 and (3) a representative of the agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where
57 the child will be placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
58 additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of the agency
59 responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing concerning the adoption by any
60 other remote technology system under such circumstances.

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING COMMITTEE
ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES)
MARCH 24, 2025
_______________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to adoption. (BDR 11-356)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to adoption; requiring background investigations of certain
persons who operate or provide services to children at a child-placing
agency; requiring the maintenance of certain records of such
background investigations; authorizing the disclosure of information
from the State Register for Adoptions to certain persons without the
consent of the natural parent under extenuating circumstances;
authorizing certain persons to attend an adoption hearing by a remote
technology system under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires certain persons who work with children or reside in certain
2 homes or facilities that provide services to children to undergo a background investigation; (2)
3 prohibits a person who has been convicted of certain crimes from working or residing in such
4 a home or facility; and (3) requires certain homes and facilities to maintain records of
5 background investigations. (NRS 62B.260-62B.280, 424.031-424.034, 432A.170-432A.1755,
6 433B.183-433B.187, 449.122-449.125) Existing law defines “child-placing agency” to mean a
7 nonprofit corporation that places children for adoption or permanent free care. (NRS 127.220)
8 Existing regulations: (1) require an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency or
9 an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency to undergo a
10 background investigation; and (2) prohibit the director of adoption of a child-placing agency
11 from allowing a person to provide services to children if the Division of Child and Family
12 Services has, based on the criminal history of the person, deemed the person to be
13 unacceptable to provide services to children. (NAC 127.140)
14 Sections 2-5 of this bill: (1) codify such requirements governing child-placing agencies
15 into existing law similarly to the manner in which the requirements governing background
16 investigations of the personnel of other homes or facilities that provide services to children are
17 codified; and (2) additionally require such background investigations to be conducted every 5
18 years. Specifically, section 2 requires the Division to: (1) investigate the background and
19 personal history of every initial applicant for a license to operate a child-placing agency and
20 every employee, volunteer or independent contractor of a child-placing agency; and (2) repeat

Assembly Amendment No. 458 to Assembly Bill No. 520 Page 4
21 such investigations every 5 years. Sections 3 and 11 of this bill prescribe the procedure for
22 conducting such an investigation. Section 3 authorizes the Division to deny an application for
23 a license to operate a child-placing agency or suspend or revoke such a license if the Division
24 determines that the applicant or licensee, as applicable: (1) has a [criminal] substantiated
25 history [or a history of child abuse and neglect] of maltreating a child that renders the person
26 unacceptable to provide services to children; or (2) has allowed an employee, volunteer or
27 independent contractor who has such a history or has not undergone such a background
28 investigation to provide services to children. Section 4 prohibits an employee, volunteer or
29 independent contractor of a child-placing agency from providing services to children under
30 such circumstances. Section 4 also requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-
31 placing agency or the holder of such a license to give an employee, independent contractor or
32 volunteer who believes that the information resulting from an investigation of his or her
33 background and criminal history is incorrect 30 days to correct the information. Section 2
34 requires the Division to prescribe by regulation the conditions under which the Division may
35 deem a person to have a [criminal history or a history of child abuse and neglect]
36 substantiated history of maltreating a child that renders the person unacceptable to provide
37 services to children. Section 5 requires an applicant for a license to operate a child-placing
38 agency or the holder of such a license to maintain records of certain information relating to
39 background investigations of employees, volunteers and independent contractors and make
40 such records available to the Division upon request. Sections 7 and 9 of this bill prohibit a
41 court from entering an order of adoption and declare any order of adoption so entered to be
42 void if the adoption was facilitated by a child-placing agency that has failed to comply with
43 sections 2-5. Section 10 of this bill makes certain definitions applicable to sections 2-5.
44 Existing law requires the Division to maintain the State Register for Adoptions to provide
45 information to identify adults who were adopted and certain relatives of such adults. Existing
46 law authorizes the Division to release certain information from the State Register to adopted
47 persons and their relatives if: (1) the natural parent of the adopted person has consented to the
48 release; and (2) the adopted person has not requested to restrict the release of the information.
49 (NRS 127.007) Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Division to release such information
50 without the written consent of the natural parent if the Division determines that extenuating
51 circumstances exist to justify the release of the information.
52 Existing law authorizes the prospective adoptive parents to attend a court hearing
53 concerning the adoption by telephone instead of in person if: (1) the prospective adoptive
54 parents reside in another state or jurisdiction; (2) the child who is the subject of the hearing is
55 in the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services or a child-placing agency;
56 and (3) a representative of the agency responsible for supervising the child in the state where
57 the child will be placed attends the hearing by telephone. (NRS 127.145) Section 8 of this bill
58 additionally authorizes the prospective adoptive parents and the representative of the agency
59 responsible for supervising the child to attend a court hearing concerning the adoption by any
60 other remote technology system under such circumstances.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 127 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2 to 5, inclusive, of this act.

39 and neglect] been substantiated through information in the Central Repository or
40 other available information to have a history of maltreating a child that , in
41 accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 2 of this act, renders
42 the person unacceptable to provide services to children.
43 [6. The Division shall immediately inform the applicant for a license to
44 operate a child-placing agency or person who is licensed to operate a child-
45 placing agency whether an employee, volunteer or independent contractor of the

47 of child abuse and neglect that renders the person unacceptable to provide
48 services to children. The information provided to the applicant for a license to
49 operate a child-placing agency or the person who is licensed to operate a child-
50 placing agency must not include specific information relating to any criminal
51 conviction, including, without limitation, the specific crime for which the person
