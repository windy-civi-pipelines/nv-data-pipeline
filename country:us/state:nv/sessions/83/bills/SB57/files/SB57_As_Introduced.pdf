AN ACT relating to peace officers; clarifying that requirements for
certain law enforcement agencies relating to the use of
portable event recording devices do not apply to certain
peace officers; clarifying that records made by certain
portable event recording devices are not public records;
clarifying that requirements relating to the use of a

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law grants certain persons the powers of a peace officer. (NRS
2 289.150-289.360) Existing law also requires certain persons who possess the
3 powers of a peace officer to wear a portable event recording device under certain
4 circumstances. Specifically, a law enforcement agency shall require uniformed
5 peace officers that it employs and who routinely interact with the public to wear a
6 portable event recording device while on duty. Any record made by a portable
7 event recording device worn by such a uniformed peace officer employed by a law
8 enforcement agency is a public record. Existing law defines a “law enforcement
9 agency” for such purposes to mean: (1) the sheriff’s office of a county; (2) a
10 metropolitan police department; (3) a police department of an incorporated city; (4)
11 a department, division or municipal court of a city or town that employs marshals;
12 (5) the Nevada Highway Patrol; or (6) a board of trustees of any county school
13 district that employs or appoints school police officers. (NRS 289.830)
14 Section 1 of this bill clarifies that the provisions of law that require certain
15 uniformed peace officers employed by such law enforcement agencies to wear a
16 portable event recording device do not require other persons who possess the

17 powers of a peace officer to wear a portable event recording device. Section 1
18 further clarifies that any record made by a portable event recording device which is
19 not required to be worn is not a public record unless otherwise provided by specific
20 statute. Finally, section 1 clarifies that the requirements relating to the use of a
21 portable event recording device do not apply to a law enforcement agency which is
22 not explicitly included in the existing definition of “law enforcement agency.”
