Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the permitting and regulation of food establishments

3 of the Department of Health and Human Services or the local board of health. (NRS
4 446.050, 446.870-446.940) Section 1 of this bill requires a food establishment to
5 ensure that any person employed in, operating or otherwise working for the food
6 establishment does not use latex gloves or utensils or other latex implements at the
7 food establishment. A health authority would be authorized to suspend the permit
8 of a food establishment for violating section 1, and repeated violations may result
9 in permanent revocation of such a permit. (NRS 446.880) A violation of section 1
10 would also be a misdemeanor. (NRS 446.945)
11 Section 2 of this bill requires a medical facility, facility for the dependent and
12 certain other health facilities to ensure that employees, contractors and volunteers
13 do not use latex gloves or other latex implements at the facility. Section 8 of this
14 bill: (1) prohibits a provider of health care from using latex gloves or other latex
15 implements at any facility or other location where he or she provides health care
16 services; and (2) requires a provider of health care who owns or operates a health
17 facility to ensure that employees, contractors and volunteers do not use latex gloves
18 or other latex implements. Section 3 of this bill makes the definition of “medical
19 facility” in existing law, which includes, without limitation, programs of hospital
