SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the testing of
emissions from motor vehicles. (BDR 40-661)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring regulations adopted
by the State Environmental Commission for the control of
emissions from motor vehicles to provide for the biennial
inspection and testing of motor vehicles and systems; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Environmental Commission, in cooperation with
2 the Department of Motor Vehicles and any local air pollution control agency, to adopt
3 regulations for the control of emissions from motor vehicles in areas designated by
4 the Commission that are in any county whose population is 100,000 or more
5 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 445B.770) Existing law further
6 requires that certain vehicles which require inspection pursuant to such regulations
7 have evidence of compliance upon registration or reregistration. (NRS 445B.795)
8 Section 1 of this bill requires the Commission, when prescribing regulations for
9 the control of emissions from motor vehicles in certain areas, to provide for the
10 biennial inspection and testing of motor vehicles and systems for the control of
11 emissions.
12 Existing law provides that a new motor vehicle is exempt from compliance with
13 certain provisions governing the controls of emissions from a motor vehicle which is
14 being operated on a highway until the fourth registration of the motor vehicle. (NRS
15 445B.825) Notwithstanding such an exemption, existing law: (1) authorizes the
16 Department, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and
17 Washoe Counties), to conduct a test of the emissions from such a motor vehicle to
18 determine whether the vehicle complies with such provisions; and (2) requires the
19 Department, if the Department conducts such a test, to conduct the test to determine
20 whether the motor vehicle complies with such provisions annually after the fourth
21 registration of the motor vehicle. (NRS 445B.798, 445B.825) Section 2 of this bill
22 instead requires such tests to be conducted biennially after the fourth registration of
23 the vehicle.

12 the program is deemed necessary to achieve or maintain the
13 prescribed standards for the quality of ambient air in areas of the
14 State designated by the Commission, the Commission shall, in
15 cooperation with the Department of Motor Vehicles and any local
16 air pollution control agency established under NRS 445B.500 which
17 has jurisdiction in a designated area, adopt regulations and
18 transportation controls as may be necessary to carry out the
19 program.
20 3. The regulations [must distinguish] :
21 (a) Must:
22 (1) Distinguish between light-duty and heavy-duty motor
23 vehicles ; and [may]

27 section; and
28 (b) May prescribe:
29 [(a)] (1) Appropriate criteria and procedures for the approval,
30 installation and use of devices for the control of emissions from

36 shall license authorized stations to inspect, repair, adjust and install
37 devices for the control of emissions for motor vehicles, including
38 criteria by which any person may become qualified to inspect,
39 repair, adjust and install those devices.
