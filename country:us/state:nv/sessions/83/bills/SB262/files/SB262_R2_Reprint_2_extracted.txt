participation in Medicaid to support graduate medical
education; making an appropriation to the Account for the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
2 the Office of the Governor and requires the Director of the Office to implement the
3 Graduate Medical Education Grant Program. (NRS 223.600, 223.610) Existing law:
4 (1) requires the Office to establish and administer the Program to award grants to
5 institutions in this State seeking to create, expand or retain programs for residency
6 training and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians; (2) creates the Account for the
7 Graduate Medical Education Grant Program, administered by the Director; and (3)
8 creates the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical Education to evaluate
9 applications and make recommendations for such grants. (NRS 223.631-223.639)
10 Sections 3-7 of this bill transfer the Advisory Council and the duties to administer
11 the Program and the Account from the Office to the Department of Health and
12 Human Services. Sections 1.5 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to
13 remove the Program and the Advisory Council from the duties required to be
14 performed by the Director. Section 1 of this bill prohibits an institution that
15 receives a grant through the Program from eliminating or reducing the size of a
16 program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of
17 the Department. Sections 3 and 6 expand the grants that may be made from the
18 Account under the Program to include grants to institutions which operate programs
19 for residency training that are training a number of residents that exceeds the
20 number of full-time equivalent residents for which the institution receives certain
21 payments from Medicare. Section 6 authorizes the Department to award limited
22 grants to assist in building administrative and operational capacity for a new
23 program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships and recruiting
24 personnel essential to the operation of such a program. Section 6 also establishes
25 the criteria for prioritizing the awarding of grants. Section 7.7 of this bill requires
26 the Department, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to explore ways to use
27 federal financial participation in Medicaid to support programs for residency
28 training and postdoctoral fellowships. Section 7.3 makes a conforming change to
29 require the Director of the Department to administer section 7.7 in the same
30 manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 8 of this bill makes an
31 appropriation to the Account for the Program.

Services; transferring the administration of the Graduate
Medical Education Grant Program and the Account for

participation in Medicaid to support graduate medical
education; making an appropriation to the Account for the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
2 the Office of the Governor and requires the Director of the Office to implement the
3 Graduate Medical Education Grant Program. (NRS 223.600, 223.610) Existing law:
4 (1) requires the Office to establish and administer the Program to award grants to
5 institutions in this State seeking to create, expand or retain programs for residency
6 training and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians; (2) creates the Account for the
7 Graduate Medical Education Grant Program, administered by the Director; and (3)
8 creates the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical Education to evaluate
9 applications and make recommendations for such grants. (NRS 223.631-223.639)
10 Sections 3-7 of this bill transfer the Advisory Council and the duties to administer
11 the Program and the Account from the Office to the Department of Health and
12 Human Services. Sections 1.5 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to
13 remove the Program and the Advisory Council from the duties required to be
14 performed by the Director. Section 1 of this bill prohibits an institution that
15 receives a grant through the Program from eliminating or reducing the size of a
16 program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of
17 the Department. Sections 3 and 6 expand the grants that may be made from the
18 Account under the Program to include grants to institutions which operate programs
19 for residency training that are training a number of residents that exceeds the
20 number of full-time equivalent residents for which the institution receives certain
21 payments from Medicare. Section 6 authorizes the Department to award limited
22 grants to assist in building administrative and operational capacity for a new
23 program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships and recruiting
24 personnel essential to the operation of such a program. Section 6 also establishes
25 the criteria for prioritizing the awarding of grants. Section 7.7 of this bill requires
26 the Department, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to explore ways to use
27 federal financial participation in Medicaid to support programs for residency
28 training and postdoctoral fellowships. Section 7.3 makes a conforming change to
29 require the Director of the Department to administer section 7.7 in the same
30 manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 8 of this bill makes an
31 appropriation to the Account for the Program.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 223 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An institution that receives a grant through the Graduate
