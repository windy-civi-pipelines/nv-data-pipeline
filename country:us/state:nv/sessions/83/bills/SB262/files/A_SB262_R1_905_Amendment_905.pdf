AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain institutions from
eliminating or reducing the size of a program for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of the
Department of Health and Human Services; transferring the
administration of the Graduate Medical Education Grant Program and
the Account for the Program from the Office of Science, Innovation
and Technology in the Office of the Governor to the Department ; [of
Health and Human Services;] expanding the purposes for which
institutions that provide programs for residency training and
postdoctoral fellowships in this State may receive grants under the
Program; establishing the criteria for prioritizing the awarding of
such grants; requiring the Department to explore ways to use
federal financial participation in Medicaid to support graduate
medical education; making an appropriation to the Account for the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in the Office
2 of the Governor and requires the Director of the Office to implement the Graduate Medical
3 Education Grant Program. (NRS 223.600, 223.610) Existing law: (1) requires the Office to
4 establish and administer the Program to award grants to institutions in this State seeking to

Assembly Amendment No. 905 to Senate Bill No. 262 First Reprint Page 4
5 create, expand or retain programs for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships for
6 physicians; (2) creates the Account for the Graduate Medical Education Grant Program,
7 administered by the Director; and (3) creates the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical
8 Education to evaluate applications and make recommendations for such grants. (NRS
9 223.631-223.639) Sections 3-7 of this bill transfer the Advisory Council and the duties to
10 administer the Program and the Account from the Office to the Department of Health and
11 Human Services. Sections [1] 1.5 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to remove the
12 Program and the Advisory Council from the duties required to be performed by the Director.
13 Section 1 of this bill prohibits an institution that receives a grant through the Program
14 from eliminating or reducing the size of a program for residency training and
15 postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of the Department. Sections 3 and 6
16 expand the grants that may be made from the Account under the Program to include grants to
17 institutions which operate programs for residency training that are training a number of
18 residents that exceeds the number of full-time equivalent residents for which the institution
19 receives certain payments from Medicare. Section 6 authorizes the Department to award
20 limited grants to assist in building administrative and operational capacity for a new
21 program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships and recruiting personnel
22 essential to the operation of such a program. Section 6 also establishes the criteria for
23 prioritizing the awarding of grants. Section 7.7 of this bill requires the Department, in
24 collaboration with the Advisory Council, to explore ways to use federal financial
25 participation in Medicaid to support programs for residency training and postdoctoral
26 fellowships. Section 7.3 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
27 Department to administer section 7.7 in the same manner as other provisions governing
28 Medicaid. Section 8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Account for the Program.
