AN ACT relating to health care; transferring the administration of the Graduate

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in the Office
2 of the Governor and requires the Director of the Office to implement the Graduate Medical
3 Education Grant Program. (NRS 223.600, 223.610) Existing law: (1) requires the Office to
4 establish and administer the Program to award grants to institutions in this State seeking to
5 create, expand or retain programs for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships for
6 physicians; (2) creates the Account for the Graduate Medical Education Grant Program,
7 administered by the Director; and (3) creates the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical
8 Education to evaluate applications and make recommendations for such grants. (NRS
9 223.631-223.639) Sections 3-7 of this bill transfer the Advisory Council and the duties to
10 administer the Program and the Account from the Office to the Department of Health and
11 Human Services. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to remove the
12 Program and the Advisory Council from the duties required to be performed by the Director.
