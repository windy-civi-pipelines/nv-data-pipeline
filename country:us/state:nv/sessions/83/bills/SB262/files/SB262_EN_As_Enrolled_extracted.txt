the Department of Health and Human Services; transferring
the administration of the Graduate Medical Education Grant
Program and the Account for the Program from the Office of

prioritizing the awarding of such grants; requiring the
Department to explore ways to use federal financial
participation in Medicaid to support graduate medical

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
the Office of the Governor and requires the Director of the Office to implement the
Graduate Medical Education Grant Program. (NRS 223.600, 223.610) Existing law:
(1) requires the Office to establish and administer the Program to award grants to
institutions in this State seeking to create, expand or retain programs for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians; (2) creates the Account for the
Graduate Medical Education Grant Program, administered by the Director; and (3)
creates the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical Education to evaluate
applications and make recommendations for such grants. (NRS 223.631-223.639)

Section 2:
Sections 3-7 of this bill transfer the Advisory Council and the duties to administer
the Program and the Account from the Office to the Department of Health and
Human Services. Sections 1.5 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to
remove the Program and the Advisory Council from the duties required to be
performed by the Director. Section 1 of this bill prohibits an institution that
receives a grant through the Program from eliminating or reducing the size of a
program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of
the Department. Sections 3 and 6 expand the grants that may be made from the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
Account under the Program to include grants to institutions which operate programs
for residency training that are training a number of residents that exceeds the
number of full-time equivalent residents for which the institution receives certain
payments from Medicare. Section 6 authorizes the Department to award limited
grants to assist in building administrative and operational capacity for a new
program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships and recruiting
personnel essential to the operation of such a program. Section 6 also establishes
the criteria for prioritizing the awarding of grants. Section 7.7 of this bill requires
the Department, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to explore ways to use
federal financial participation in Medicaid to support programs for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships. Section 7.3 makes a conforming change to
require the Director of the Department to administer section 7.7 in the same
manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 8 of this bill makes an
appropriation to the Account for the Program.

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain institutions from
eliminating or reducing the size of a program for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of
the Department of Health and Human Services; transferring
the administration of the Graduate Medical Education Grant
Program and the Account for the Program from the Office of
Science, Innovation and Technology in the Office of the
Governor to the Department; expanding the purposes for
which institutions that provide programs for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships in this State may
receive grants under the Program; establishing the criteria for
prioritizing the awarding of such grants; requiring the
Department to explore ways to use federal financial
participation in Medicaid to support graduate medical
education; making an appropriation to the Account for the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
the Office of the Governor and requires the Director of the Office to implement the
Graduate Medical Education Grant Program. (NRS 223.600, 223.610) Existing law:
(1) requires the Office to establish and administer the Program to award grants to
institutions in this State seeking to create, expand or retain programs for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians; (2) creates the Account for the
Graduate Medical Education Grant Program, administered by the Director; and (3)
creates the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical Education to evaluate
applications and make recommendations for such grants. (NRS 223.631-223.639)
Sections 3-7 of this bill transfer the Advisory Council and the duties to administer
the Program and the Account from the Office to the Department of Health and
Human Services. Sections 1.5 and 2 of this bill make conforming changes to
remove the Program and the Advisory Council from the duties required to be
performed by the Director. Section 1 of this bill prohibits an institution that
receives a grant through the Program from eliminating or reducing the size of a
program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of
the Department. Sections 3 and 6 expand the grants that may be made from the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Account under the Program to include grants to institutions which operate programs
for residency training that are training a number of residents that exceeds the
number of full-time equivalent residents for which the institution receives certain
payments from Medicare. Section 6 authorizes the Department to award limited
grants to assist in building administrative and operational capacity for a new
program for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships and recruiting
personnel essential to the operation of such a program. Section 6 also establishes
the criteria for prioritizing the awarding of grants. Section 7.7 of this bill requires
the Department, in collaboration with the Advisory Council, to explore ways to use
federal financial participation in Medicaid to support programs for residency
training and postdoctoral fellowships. Section 7.3 makes a conforming change to
require the Director of the Department to administer section 7.7 in the same
manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 8 of this bill makes an
appropriation to the Account for the Program.
