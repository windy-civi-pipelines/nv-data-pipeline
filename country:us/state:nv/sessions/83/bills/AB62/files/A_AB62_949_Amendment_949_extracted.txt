SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to transferable tax credits for affordable
housing. (BDR 32-437)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising the procedure for applying for transferable
tax credits for affordable housing; revising provisions governing the
transfer of transferable tax credits for affordable housing; revising
provisions relating to the amount of transferable tax credits for
affordable housing that may be approved; revising provisions relating
to the expiration of transferable tax credits for affordable housing; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
2 to issue transferable tax credits, which are authorized to be taken against certain state taxes, to
3 the sponsor of a project for the acquisition, development, construction, improvement,
4 expansion, reconstruction or rehabilitation of low income housing, as defined by existing
5 federal law. (NRS 360.860-360.870; 26 U.S.C. § 42) Under existing law, to be issued
6 transferable tax credits, the project sponsor is required to: (1) apply to, and obtain from, the
7 Division a reservation of an amount of transferable tax credits; (2) close the project within a
8 certain period after obtaining a reservation of transferable tax credits by acquiring title to the
9 project site, entering into an agreement with a licensed contractor to construct the project and
10 obtaining certain financing for the project; and (3) submit to the Division a final application
11 for the issuance of transferable tax credits not less than 45 days before the project closes. A
12 project sponsor that is issued transferable tax credits is authorized to transfer those credits to
13 another entity, and that entity is authorized to transfer the credits to one or more of its
14 subsidiaries or affiliates. (NRS 360.867)
15 Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, a final application for the
16 issuance of transferable tax credits to be submitted not less than 15 days before the closing of
17 the project rather than not less than 45 days before the closing of the project; (2) authorizes a
18 project sponsor to demonstrate the acquisition of the land to close the project by entering into
19 a long-term ground lease for the project site; and (3) authorizes a project sponsor to transfer
20 transferable tax credits to a member or partner of the project sponsor to any other entity, who
21 may then transfer the transferable tax credits to another entity.
22 Existing law limits to $10,000,000 the amount of transferable tax credits which the
23 Division is authorized to approve in each fiscal year, with certain exceptions. If the Division
24 determines that approval of more than $10,000,000 of transferable tax credits in a fiscal year
Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 4
25 is necessary to ensure the maximum development of affordable housing through the issuance
26 of transferable tax credits, the Division is authorized to approve not more than $13,000,000 of
27 transferable tax credits in that fiscal year and must reduce the amount of transferable tax
28 credits authorized to be approved in the next fiscal year by the amount of credits that are
29 approved in excess of $10,000,000. (NRS 360.868) Section 2 of this bill provides that any
30 such reduction to the amount of transferable tax credits authorized to be approved in a fiscal
31 year must first reduce the amount of unused transferable tax credits from prior fiscal years that
32 are available for approval before the amount of transferable tax credits available for approval
33 in a fiscal year is reduced below $10,000,000. Additionally, [section 2 increases from
34 $40,000,000 to $100,000,000 the total amount of transferable tax credits for affordable
35 housing that the Division is authorized to approve for all fiscal years. Finally,] section 2
36 provides that the 4-year period during which transferable tax credits may be used begins on
37 the date on which the Division notifies the project sponsor that transferable tax credits will be
38 issued rather than on the date on which the Division issues the transferable tax credits.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 360.867 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 360.867 1. On behalf of a project, the project sponsor may apply to the
3 Division for a certificate of eligibility for transferable tax credits which may be
4 applied to:
5 (a) Any tax imposed by chapter 363A or 363B of NRS;
6 (b) The gaming license fees imposed by the provisions of NRS 463.370;
7 (c) Any tax imposed by chapter 680B of NRS; or
8 (d) Any combination of the fees and taxes described in paragraphs (a), (b) and
9 (c).
10 2. To apply for a certificate of eligibility for transferable tax credits, the
11 project sponsor must:
12 (a) Submit an application on a form prescribed by the Division; and
13 (b) Comply with the requirements to obtain an allocation of federal low-
14 income housing tax credits which are set forth in the qualified allocation plan.
15 3. The Division shall:
16 (a) Review each application for a certificate of eligibility for transferable tax
17 credits submitted pursuant to subsection 2 and any supporting documents to
18 determine whether the requirements for eligibility for a reservation of transferable
19 tax credits are met and the amount of transferable tax credit threshold points
20 awarded to the project;
21 (b) Determine the amount of transferable tax credits for which the project may
22 be eligible, which amount must equal the amount determined by the Division to be
23 necessary to make the project financially feasible after considering all other sources
24 of financing for the project; and
25 (c) Reserve the amount of transferable tax credits for which each project is
26 determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b) in the order of the amount of
27 transferable tax credit threshold points awarded to each such project pursuant to
28 paragraph (a) until a reservation is made for each project or the amount of
29 transferable credits reserved for the fiscal year is equal to the amount of
30 transferable tax credits which the Division is authorized to approve for the fiscal
31 year pursuant to NRS 360.868, whichever occurs first. If the amount of transferable
32 tax credits reserved for the fiscal year reaches the amount of transferable tax credits
33 which the Division is authorized to approve for the fiscal year pursuant to NRS
34 360.868 before each eligible project is reserved the full amount of transferable tax
35 credits for which it is determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b), the
Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 5
1 Division may take any action that the Division determines will ensure the
2 maximum development of affordable housing in this State, including, without
3 limitation, proportionally reducing the reservation of each project for which
4 transferable tax credits are reserved or reserving for the last project to receive a
5 reservation of transferable tax credits an amount of transferable tax credits that is
6 less than the full amount of transferable tax credits for which the project was
7 determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b).
8 4. If the Division reserves transferable tax credits for a project pursuant to
9 subsection 3, the Division shall provide written notice of the reservation which
10 identifies the amount of the tax credits reserved for the project to:
11 (a) The project sponsor;
12 (b) The Department;
13 (c) The Nevada Gaming Control Board;
14 (d) The Office of Finance; and
15 (e) The Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
16 5. The Division:
17 (a) Shall terminate a reservation of transferable tax credits if the project for
18 which the reservation is awarded is not closed within the period specified in
19 paragraph (a) of subsection 6 unless, before the expiration of that period, the
20 Division receives from the project sponsor a written request for an extension of not
21 more than 45 days. The Division may grant only one extension pursuant to this
22 paragraph and, if the project is not closed before the expiration of the extension
23 period, the Division must terminate the reservation of transferable tax credits. A
24 request for an extension submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied
25 by proof satisfactory to the Division that:
26 (1) The requirements for financing the project have been substantially
27 completed;
28 (2) The delay in closing was the result of circumstances that could not have
29 been anticipated by and were outside the control of the project sponsor at the time
30 the application was submitted by the project sponsor; and
31 (3) The project will be closed not later than 45 days after the Division
32 receives the request.
33 (b) May terminate a reservation of transferable tax credits if the Division
34 determines that any event, circumstance or condition occurs for which a reservation
35 of federal low-income housing tax credits may be terminated. If transferable tax
36 credits are terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the Division may issue a
37 reservation for the amount of transferable tax credits terminated to other projects
38 eligible for transferable tax credits in the order of the amount of transferable tax
39 credit threshold points awarded to each such project pursuant to paragraph (a) of
40 subsection 3.
41 6. Except as otherwise provided in this section, to be issued transferable tax
42 credits:
43 (a) Not later than 270 days after the Division provides written notice of the
44 reservation of transferable tax credits pursuant to subsection 4, the project sponsor
45 must demonstrate to the Division that the project has been closed by providing
46 proof satisfactory to the Division that the project sponsor has:
47 (1) Purchased and holds title in fee simple to , or has entered into a long-
48 term ground lease for, the project site in the name of the project sponsor.
49 (2) Entered into a written agreement with a contractor who is licensed in
50 this State to begin construction.
51 (3) Obtained adequate financing for the construction of the project. The
52 applicant must provide written commitments or contracts from third parties.
Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 6
1 (4) Executed a written commitment for a loan for permanent financing for
2 the construction of the project in an amount that ensures the financial feasibility of
3 the project. The commitment may be subject to the condition that the construction
4 is completed and the project is appraised for an amount sufficient to justify the loan
5 in accordance with the requirements of the lender for credit. If the project is a rural
6 development project that receives loans or grants from the United States
7 Department of Agriculture, the applicant must provide a form approved by the
8 Division that indicates that money has been obligated for the construction of the
9 project before the expiration of the period. An advance of that money is not
10 required before the expiration of the period.
11 (b) Not less than [45] 15 days before the project is closed, the project sponsor
12 must submit to the Division a final application for transferable tax credits on a form
13 provided by the Division and such other information as the Division deems
14 necessary to determine whether the project qualifies for the issuance of transferable
15 tax credits. Upon receipt of a final application pursuant to this paragraph, the
16 Division shall complete a review of the project and the project sponsor. If, after
17 such review, the Division determines that the project complies with the
18 requirements upon which transferable tax credits were reserved pursuant to this
19 section and a declaration of restrictive covenants and conditions will be recorded in
20 the office of the county recorder for the county in which the project is located:
21 (1) The Division shall:
22 (I) Determine the appropriate amount of transferable tax credits for the
23 project, which must be the amount the Division determines is necessary to make the
24 project financially feasible after all other sources of funding are allocated and paid
25 toward the final cost of the project and may not exceed the amount of transferable
26 tax credits reserved for the project pursuant to this section; and
27 (II) Notify the project sponsor that the transferable tax credits will be
28 issued;
29 (2) Within 30 days after the receipt of the notice, the project sponsor shall
30 make an irrevocable declaration of the amount of transferable tax credits that will
31 be applied to each fee or tax set forth in subsection 1, thereby accounting for all of
32 the credits which will be issued; and
33 (3) Upon receipt of the declaration described in subparagraph (2), the
34 Division shall issue transferable tax credits to the project sponsor in the amount
35 approved by the Division. The project sponsor may transfer the transferable tax
36 credits to a member or partner of the project sponsor or to any other entity. The
37 project sponsor shall notify the Division upon transferring any transferable tax
38 credits. An entity to which a project sponsor transfers any transferable tax credits
39 may transfer those transferable tax credits to one or more of its subsidiaries or
40 affiliates and shall notify the Division upon making any such transfer. The Division
41 shall notify the Department of Taxation, the Office of Finance, the Fiscal Analysis
42 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the Nevada Gaming Control Board
43 of all transferable tax credits issued, segregated by each fee or tax set forth in
44 subsection 1, and of all transferable tax credits transferred, segregated by each fee
45 or tax set forth in subsection 1.
46 7. Upon completion of the project, the project sponsor shall submit to the
47 Division a certification of costs on a form provided by the Division and such other
48 information as the Division deems necessary to determine the final cost of the
49 project. If, based upon the final cost of the project indicated in the certification of
50 costs, the Division determines that the amount of transferable tax credits issued by
51 the Division to the project sponsor is greater than the amount of transferable tax
52 credits to which the project sponsor is entitled:
Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 7
1 (a) The Division shall notify the project sponsor, the Department of Taxation,
2 the Office of Finance, the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel
3 Bureau and the Nevada Gaming Control Board that the project sponsor is required
4 to repay the portion of the transferable tax credits to which the project sponsor is
5 not entitled. The notice must specify the amount of transferable tax credits that the
6 project sponsor is required to repay.
7 (b) The project sponsor shall repay to the Department of Taxation or the
8 Nevada Gaming Control Board, as applicable, the portion of the transferable tax
9 credits to which the project sponsor is not entitled.
10 8. The project sponsor may submit a request to the Administrator of the
11 Division to protect from disclosure any information in the application which, under
12 generally accepted business practices, would be considered a trade secret or other
13 confidential proprietary information of the business. After consulting with the
14 business, the Administrator of the Division shall determine whether to protect the
15 information from disclosure. The decision of the Administrator of the Division is
16 final and is not subject to judicial review. If the Administrator of the Division
17 determines to protect the information from disclosure, the protected information:
18 (a) Is confidential proprietary information of the business;
19 (b) Is not a public record;
20 (c) Must be redacted by the Administrator of the Division from any copy of the
21 application that is disclosed to the public; and
22 (d) Must not be disclosed to any person who is not an officer or employee of
23 the Division unless the lead participant consents to the disclosure.
24 9. The Division may adopt any regulations necessary to carry out the
25 provisions of NRS 360.860 to 360.870, inclusive.
26 10. The Nevada Tax Commission and the Nevada Gaming Commission:
27 (a) Shall adopt regulations prescribing the manner in which transferable tax
28 credits described in this section will be administered.
29 (b) May adopt any other regulations that are necessary to carry out the
30 provisions of NRS 360.860 to 360.870, inclusive.
31 11. As used in this section:
32 (a) “Affiliate” means a person who, directly or indirectly through one or more
33 intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a
34 specified person.
35 (b) “Certification of costs” means a report from an independent certified public
36 accountant attesting:
37 (1) To the amount of the actual costs of construction of the project; and
38 (2) That those costs may be included in the eligible basis of the project
39 pursuant to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. § 42.
40 (c) “Subsidiary” means an entity in which a person owns beneficially or of
41 record 50 percent or more of the outstanding equity interests.
42 (d) “Transferable tax credit threshold points” means points awarded based on
43 specific objectives determined by the Division through the dissemination of a
44 strategic plan for the development of affordable housing created by the Division,
45 the review of housing data and the receipt of input from persons interested in the
46 development of affordable housing.
47 Sec. 2. NRS 360.868 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 360.868 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Division
49 shall not approve any application for transferable tax credits submitted pursuant to
50 NRS 360.867 if:
51 (a) Approval of the application would cause the total amount of transferable
52 tax credits approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 for each fiscal year to exceed
53 $10,000,000. Any portion of the $10,000,000 per fiscal year for which transferable
Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 8
1 tax credits have not previously been approved may be carried forward and made
2 available for approval during the next or any future fiscal year. If the Division
3 determines that approval of an application that would cause the total amount of
4 transferable tax credits approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in a fiscal year to exceed
5 $10,000,000 is necessary to ensure the maximum development of affordable
6 housing in this State through the approval of transferable tax credits pursuant to
7 NRS 360.867, the Division may approve the application unless the approval of the
8 application would cause the total amount of transferable tax credits approved
9 pursuant to NRS 360.867 in the fiscal year to exceed $13,000,000. If the Division
10 approves an application for transferable tax credits that causes the total amount of
11 transferable tax credits approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in a fiscal year to exceed
12 $10,000,000, the Division must reduce the amount of transferable tax credits which
13 may be approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in the next fiscal year by the amount of
14 transferable tax credits approved in excess of $10,000,000 in the previous fiscal
15 year. Any reduction made pursuant to this paragraph to the amount of
16 transferable tax credits which may be approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in a
17 fiscal year must be made to the amount of carried forward transferable tax
18 credits available for approval in a fiscal year before the amount of transferable
19 tax credits which may be approved in a fiscal year is reduced below $10,000,000.
20 (b) Approval of the application would cause the total amount of transferable
21 tax credits approved for all fiscal years pursuant to NRS 360.867 to exceed
22 $40,000,000. [$100,000,000.]
23 2. The transferable tax credits issued to a project sponsor pursuant to NRS
24 360.867 expire 4 years after the date on which the Division notifies the project
25 sponsor that the transferable tax credits [are] will be issued [to the project sponsor.]
26 as required by subsection 6 of NRS 360.867.
27 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to transferable tax credits for affordable
housing. (BDR 32-437)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising the procedure for applying for transferable
tax credits for affordable housing; revising provisions governing the
transfer of transferable tax credits for affordable housing; revising
provisions relating to the amount of transferable tax credits for
affordable housing that may be approved; revising provisions relating
to the expiration of transferable tax credits for affordable housing; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
2 to issue transferable tax credits, which are authorized to be taken against certain state taxes, to
3 the sponsor of a project for the acquisition, development, construction, improvement,
4 expansion, reconstruction or rehabilitation of low income housing, as defined by existing
5 federal law. (NRS 360.860-360.870; 26 U.S.C. § 42) Under existing law, to be issued
6 transferable tax credits, the project sponsor is required to: (1) apply to, and obtain from, the
7 Division a reservation of an amount of transferable tax credits; (2) close the project within a
8 certain period after obtaining a reservation of transferable tax credits by acquiring title to the
9 project site, entering into an agreement with a licensed contractor to construct the project and
10 obtaining certain financing for the project; and (3) submit to the Division a final application
11 for the issuance of transferable tax credits not less than 45 days before the project closes. A
12 project sponsor that is issued transferable tax credits is authorized to transfer those credits to
13 another entity, and that entity is authorized to transfer the credits to one or more of its
14 subsidiaries or affiliates. (NRS 360.867)
15 Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires, with certain exceptions, a final application for the
16 issuance of transferable tax credits to be submitted not less than 15 days before the closing of
17 the project rather than not less than 45 days before the closing of the project; (2) authorizes a
18 project sponsor to demonstrate the acquisition of the land to close the project by entering into
19 a long-term ground lease for the project site; and (3) authorizes a project sponsor to transfer
20 transferable tax credits to a member or partner of the project sponsor to any other entity, who
21 may then transfer the transferable tax credits to another entity.
22 Existing law limits to $10,000,000 the amount of transferable tax credits which the
23 Division is authorized to approve in each fiscal year, with certain exceptions. If the Division
24 determines that approval of more than $10,000,000 of transferable tax credits in a fiscal year

Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 4
25 is necessary to ensure the maximum development of affordable housing through the issuance
26 of transferable tax credits, the Division is authorized to approve not more than $13,000,000 of
27 transferable tax credits in that fiscal year and must reduce the amount of transferable tax
28 credits authorized to be approved in the next fiscal year by the amount of credits that are
29 approved in excess of $10,000,000. (NRS 360.868) Section 2 of this bill provides that any
30 such reduction to the amount of transferable tax credits authorized to be approved in a fiscal
31 year must first reduce the amount of unused transferable tax credits from prior fiscal years that
32 are available for approval before the amount of transferable tax credits available for approval
33 in a fiscal year is reduced below $10,000,000. Additionally, [section 2 increases from
34 $40,000,000 to $100,000,000 the total amount of transferable tax credits for affordable
35 housing that the Division is authorized to approve for all fiscal years. Finally,] section 2
36 provides that the 4-year period during which transferable tax credits may be used begins on
37 the date on which the Division notifies the project sponsor that transferable tax credits will be
38 issued rather than on the date on which the Division issues the transferable tax credits.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 360.867 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 360.867 1. On behalf of a project, the project sponsor may apply to the
3 Division for a certificate of eligibility for transferable tax credits which may be
4 applied to:
5 (a) Any tax imposed by chapter 363A or 363B of NRS;
6 (b) The gaming license fees imposed by the provisions of NRS 463.370;
7 (c) Any tax imposed by chapter 680B of NRS; or
8 (d) Any combination of the fees and taxes described in paragraphs (a), (b) and
9 (c).
10 2. To apply for a certificate of eligibility for transferable tax credits, the
11 project sponsor must:
12 (a) Submit an application on a form prescribed by the Division; and
13 (b) Comply with the requirements to obtain an allocation of federal low-
14 income housing tax credits which are set forth in the qualified allocation plan.
15 3. The Division shall:
16 (a) Review each application for a certificate of eligibility for transferable tax
17 credits submitted pursuant to subsection 2 and any supporting documents to
18 determine whether the requirements for eligibility for a reservation of transferable
19 tax credits are met and the amount of transferable tax credit threshold points
20 awarded to the project;
21 (b) Determine the amount of transferable tax credits for which the project may
22 be eligible, which amount must equal the amount determined by the Division to be
23 necessary to make the project financially feasible after considering all other sources
24 of financing for the project; and
25 (c) Reserve the amount of transferable tax credits for which each project is
26 determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b) in the order of the amount of
27 transferable tax credit threshold points awarded to each such project pursuant to
28 paragraph (a) until a reservation is made for each project or the amount of
29 transferable credits reserved for the fiscal year is equal to the amount of
30 transferable tax credits which the Division is authorized to approve for the fiscal
31 year pursuant to NRS 360.868, whichever occurs first. If the amount of transferable
32 tax credits reserved for the fiscal year reaches the amount of transferable tax credits
33 which the Division is authorized to approve for the fiscal year pursuant to NRS
34 360.868 before each eligible project is reserved the full amount of transferable tax
35 credits for which it is determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b), the

Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 5
1 Division may take any action that the Division determines will ensure the
2 maximum development of affordable housing in this State, including, without
3 limitation, proportionally reducing the reservation of each project for which
4 transferable tax credits are reserved or reserving for the last project to receive a
5 reservation of transferable tax credits an amount of transferable tax credits that is
6 less than the full amount of transferable tax credits for which the project was
7 determined to be eligible pursuant to paragraph (b).
8 4. If the Division reserves transferable tax credits for a project pursuant to
9 subsection 3, the Division shall provide written notice of the reservation which
10 identifies the amount of the tax credits reserved for the project to:
11 (a) The project sponsor;
12 (b) The Department;
13 (c) The Nevada Gaming Control Board;
14 (d) The Office of Finance; and
15 (e) The Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
16 5. The Division:
17 (a) Shall terminate a reservation of transferable tax credits if the project for
18 which the reservation is awarded is not closed within the period specified in
19 paragraph (a) of subsection 6 unless, before the expiration of that period, the
20 Division receives from the project sponsor a written request for an extension of not
21 more than 45 days. The Division may grant only one extension pursuant to this
22 paragraph and, if the project is not closed before the expiration of the extension
23 period, the Division must terminate the reservation of transferable tax credits. A
24 request for an extension submitted pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied
25 by proof satisfactory to the Division that:
26 (1) The requirements for financing the project have been substantially
27 completed;
28 (2) The delay in closing was the result of circumstances that could not have
29 been anticipated by and were outside the control of the project sponsor at the time
30 the application was submitted by the project sponsor; and
31 (3) The project will be closed not later than 45 days after the Division
32 receives the request.
33 (b) May terminate a reservation of transferable tax credits if the Division
34 determines that any event, circumstance or condition occurs for which a reservation
35 of federal low-income housing tax credits may be terminated. If transferable tax
36 credits are terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the Division may issue a
37 reservation for the amount of transferable tax credits terminated to other projects
38 eligible for transferable tax credits in the order of the amount of transferable tax
39 credit threshold points awarded to each such project pursuant to paragraph (a) of
40 subsection 3.
41 6. Except as otherwise provided in this section, to be issued transferable tax
42 credits:
43 (a) Not later than 270 days after the Division provides written notice of the
44 reservation of transferable tax credits pursuant to subsection 4, the project sponsor
45 must demonstrate to the Division that the project has been closed by providing
46 proof satisfactory to the Division that the project sponsor has:
47 (1) Purchased and holds title in fee simple to , or has entered into a long-
48 term ground lease for, the project site in the name of the project sponsor.
49 (2) Entered into a written agreement with a contractor who is licensed in
50 this State to begin construction.
51 (3) Obtained adequate financing for the construction of the project. The
52 applicant must provide written commitments or contracts from third parties.

Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 6
1 (4) Executed a written commitment for a loan for permanent financing for
2 the construction of the project in an amount that ensures the financial feasibility of
3 the project. The commitment may be subject to the condition that the construction
4 is completed and the project is appraised for an amount sufficient to justify the loan
5 in accordance with the requirements of the lender for credit. If the project is a rural
6 development project that receives loans or grants from the United States
7 Department of Agriculture, the applicant must provide a form approved by the
8 Division that indicates that money has been obligated for the construction of the
9 project before the expiration of the period. An advance of that money is not
10 required before the expiration of the period.
11 (b) Not less than [45] 15 days before the project is closed, the project sponsor
12 must submit to the Division a final application for transferable tax credits on a form
13 provided by the Division and such other information as the Division deems
14 necessary to determine whether the project qualifies for the issuance of transferable
15 tax credits. Upon receipt of a final application pursuant to this paragraph, the
16 Division shall complete a review of the project and the project sponsor. If, after
17 such review, the Division determines that the project complies with the
18 requirements upon which transferable tax credits were reserved pursuant to this
19 section and a declaration of restrictive covenants and conditions will be recorded in
20 the office of the county recorder for the county in which the project is located:
21 (1) The Division shall:
22 (I) Determine the appropriate amount of transferable tax credits for the
23 project, which must be the amount the Division determines is necessary to make the
24 project financially feasible after all other sources of funding are allocated and paid
25 toward the final cost of the project and may not exceed the amount of transferable
26 tax credits reserved for the project pursuant to this section; and
27 (II) Notify the project sponsor that the transferable tax credits will be
28 issued;
29 (2) Within 30 days after the receipt of the notice, the project sponsor shall
30 make an irrevocable declaration of the amount of transferable tax credits that will
31 be applied to each fee or tax set forth in subsection 1, thereby accounting for all of
32 the credits which will be issued; and
33 (3) Upon receipt of the declaration described in subparagraph (2), the
34 Division shall issue transferable tax credits to the project sponsor in the amount
35 approved by the Division. The project sponsor may transfer the transferable tax
36 credits to a member or partner of the project sponsor or to any other entity. The
37 project sponsor shall notify the Division upon transferring any transferable tax
38 credits. An entity to which a project sponsor transfers any transferable tax credits
39 may transfer those transferable tax credits to one or more of its subsidiaries or
40 affiliates and shall notify the Division upon making any such transfer. The Division
41 shall notify the Department of Taxation, the Office of Finance, the Fiscal Analysis
42 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the Nevada Gaming Control Board
43 of all transferable tax credits issued, segregated by each fee or tax set forth in
44 subsection 1, and of all transferable tax credits transferred, segregated by each fee
45 or tax set forth in subsection 1.
46 7. Upon completion of the project, the project sponsor shall submit to the
47 Division a certification of costs on a form provided by the Division and such other
48 information as the Division deems necessary to determine the final cost of the
49 project. If, based upon the final cost of the project indicated in the certification of
50 costs, the Division determines that the amount of transferable tax credits issued by
51 the Division to the project sponsor is greater than the amount of transferable tax
52 credits to which the project sponsor is entitled:

Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 7
1 (a) The Division shall notify the project sponsor, the Department of Taxation,
2 the Office of Finance, the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel
3 Bureau and the Nevada Gaming Control Board that the project sponsor is required
4 to repay the portion of the transferable tax credits to which the project sponsor is
5 not entitled. The notice must specify the amount of transferable tax credits that the
6 project sponsor is required to repay.
7 (b) The project sponsor shall repay to the Department of Taxation or the
8 Nevada Gaming Control Board, as applicable, the portion of the transferable tax
9 credits to which the project sponsor is not entitled.
10 8. The project sponsor may submit a request to the Administrator of the
11 Division to protect from disclosure any information in the application which, under
12 generally accepted business practices, would be considered a trade secret or other
13 confidential proprietary information of the business. After consulting with the
14 business, the Administrator of the Division shall determine whether to protect the
15 information from disclosure. The decision of the Administrator of the Division is
16 final and is not subject to judicial review. If the Administrator of the Division
17 determines to protect the information from disclosure, the protected information:
18 (a) Is confidential proprietary information of the business;
19 (b) Is not a public record;
20 (c) Must be redacted by the Administrator of the Division from any copy of the
21 application that is disclosed to the public; and
22 (d) Must not be disclosed to any person who is not an officer or employee of
23 the Division unless the lead participant consents to the disclosure.
24 9. The Division may adopt any regulations necessary to carry out the
25 provisions of NRS 360.860 to 360.870, inclusive.
26 10. The Nevada Tax Commission and the Nevada Gaming Commission:
27 (a) Shall adopt regulations prescribing the manner in which transferable tax
28 credits described in this section will be administered.
29 (b) May adopt any other regulations that are necessary to carry out the
30 provisions of NRS 360.860 to 360.870, inclusive.
31 11. As used in this section:
32 (a) “Affiliate” means a person who, directly or indirectly through one or more
33 intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a
34 specified person.
35 (b) “Certification of costs” means a report from an independent certified public
36 accountant attesting:
37 (1) To the amount of the actual costs of construction of the project; and
38 (2) That those costs may be included in the eligible basis of the project
39 pursuant to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. § 42.
40 (c) “Subsidiary” means an entity in which a person owns beneficially or of
41 record 50 percent or more of the outstanding equity interests.
42 (d) “Transferable tax credit threshold points” means points awarded based on
43 specific objectives determined by the Division through the dissemination of a
44 strategic plan for the development of affordable housing created by the Division,
45 the review of housing data and the receipt of input from persons interested in the
46 development of affordable housing.
47 Sec. 2. NRS 360.868 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 360.868 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Division
49 shall not approve any application for transferable tax credits submitted pursuant to
50 NRS 360.867 if:
51 (a) Approval of the application would cause the total amount of transferable
52 tax credits approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 for each fiscal year to exceed
53 $10,000,000. Any portion of the $10,000,000 per fiscal year for which transferable

Assembly Amendment No. 949 to Assembly Bill No. 62 Page 8
1 tax credits have not previously been approved may be carried forward and made
2 available for approval during the next or any future fiscal year. If the Division
3 determines that approval of an application that would cause the total amount of
4 transferable tax credits approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in a fiscal year to exceed
5 $10,000,000 is necessary to ensure the maximum development of affordable
6 housing in this State through the approval of transferable tax credits pursuant to
7 NRS 360.867, the Division may approve the application unless the approval of the
8 application would cause the total amount of transferable tax credits approved
9 pursuant to NRS 360.867 in the fiscal year to exceed $13,000,000. If the Division
10 approves an application for transferable tax credits that causes the total amount of
11 transferable tax credits approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in a fiscal year to exceed
12 $10,000,000, the Division must reduce the amount of transferable tax credits which
13 may be approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in the next fiscal year by the amount of
14 transferable tax credits approved in excess of $10,000,000 in the previous fiscal
15 year. Any reduction made pursuant to this paragraph to the amount of
16 transferable tax credits which may be approved pursuant to NRS 360.867 in a
17 fiscal year must be made to the amount of carried forward transferable tax
18 credits available for approval in a fiscal year before the amount of transferable
19 tax credits which may be approved in a fiscal year is reduced below $10,000,000.
20 (b) Approval of the application would cause the total amount of transferable
21 tax credits approved for all fiscal years pursuant to NRS 360.867 to exceed
22 $40,000,000. [$100,000,000.]
23 2. The transferable tax credits issued to a project sponsor pursuant to NRS
24 360.867 expire 4 years after the date on which the Division notifies the project
25 sponsor that the transferable tax credits [are] will be issued [to the project sponsor.]
26 as required by subsection 6 of NRS 360.867.
27 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
