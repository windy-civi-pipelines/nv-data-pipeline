AN ACT relating to health care; revising requirements governing
the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of
health information; establishing a program to increase
awareness of information concerning independent centers
for emergency medical care; requiring certain facilities
that are owned or operated by, or otherwise part of,
hospitals to be licensed as independent centers for
emergency medical care; requiring an independent center
for emergency medical care to provide urgent care
services under certain conditions; prohibiting a
noncompetition covenant from applying to a physician;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
2 Services to prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance,
3 transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related
4 information and electronic signatures and requirements for electronic equivalents of
-
*SB378*

– 2 –
5 written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions, existing law requires
6 various entities involved in health care, including persons and facilities that provide
7 health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance
8 with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill prohibits those
9 regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
10 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any
11 other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a
12 person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a
13 custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or
14 another person or entity upon the request of a patient within 2 business days; and
15 (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health
16 care records under such circumstances.
17 Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
18 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
19 facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
20 term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
21 dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
22 physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally exempts from requirements
23 to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
24 providers of health care whose solo practices are under a certain size or who work
25 only in concierge medicine. However, section 4 requires such high-level providers
26 of health care to furnish the medical records of a patient electronically to the patient
27 upon request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to
28 revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the
29 licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the
30 electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2
31 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and
32 sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this bill make other conforming changes to
33 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section
34 32 of this bill updates internal references changed by section 31.
35 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
36 for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
37 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill
38 requires a facility that is owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital that
39 is structurally separate from the hospital and provides limited services for the
40 treatment of a medical emergency to be licensed as an independent center for
41 emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections 15 and 16 of this bill
42 prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from charging a fee for the
43 issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the Division from
44 issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency medical care that
45 is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for emergency
46 medical care. However, section 37 of this bill requires the Division to issue a
47 license to an independent center for emergency medical care that: (1) is operating
48 on January 1, 2026; (2) is newly required by section 14 to be licensed; and (3)
49 otherwise meets the requirements for licensure, regardless of where the facility is
50 located. Section 18 of this bill requires an independent center for emergency
51 medical care to provide urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes
52 certain additional requirements related to the provision of such urgent care.
53 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
54 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
55 439A.290) Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
56 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
57 emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the
58 Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent centers
59 for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent
-
*SB378*

– 3 –
60 centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 19
61 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
62 prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently
63 required to use. Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that
64 independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same form.
65 Sections 12 and 13 require the Department to: (1) make certain information
66 concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available upon request;
67 and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
68 medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department. Section 23 of
69 this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that Internet
70 website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
71 medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability
72 of certain definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the
73 Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
74 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally
75 include information on the status of the program to increase awareness of
76 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care.
77 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
78 of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
79 of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified
80 period of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for
81 minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
82 petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
83 dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
84 acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
85 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
86 sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
87 the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
88 serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
89 services.
90 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
91 action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
92 27 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
93 documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27
94 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
95 Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
96 process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
97 (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
98 a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes
99 a conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 27 and 28 in the
100 same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
101 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
102 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
103 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
104 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
105 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
106 Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
107 physician.

19 (c) The former employee is otherwise complying with the
20 limitations in the covenant as to time, geographical area and scope
21 of activity to be restrained, other than any limitation on providing
22 services to a former customer or client who seeks the services of the
23 former employee without any contact instigated by the former
24 employee.
25  Any provision in a noncompetition covenant which violates the
26 provisions of this subsection is void and unenforceable.
27 3. A noncompetition covenant may not apply to a physician or
28 an employee who is paid solely on an hourly wage basis, exclusive
29 of any tips or gratuities.

33 NRS 613.200.
34 5. If the termination of the employment of an employee is the
35 result of a reduction of force, reorganization or similar restructuring
36 of the employer, a noncompetition covenant is only enforceable
37 during the period in which the employer is paying the employee’s
38 salary, benefits or equivalent compensation, including, without
39 limitation, severance pay.
40 6. If an employer brings an action to enforce a noncompetition

45 not reasonable, imposes a greater restraint than is necessary for the
-
*SB378*

– 33 –
1 protection of the employer for whose benefit the restraint is imposed
2 or imposes undue hardship on the employee, the court shall revise
3 the covenant to the extent necessary and enforce the covenant as
4 revised. Such revisions must cause the limitations contained in the
5 covenant as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be
6 restrained to be reasonable, to not impose undue hardship on the
7 employee and to impose a restraint that is not greater than is
8 necessary for the protection of the employer for whose benefit the
9 restraint is imposed.
10 7. If an employer brings an action to enforce a noncompetition
11 covenant or an employee or contractor brings an action to challenge
12 a noncompetition covenant and the court finds that the
13 noncompetition covenant applies to [an employee] a person
14 described in subsection 3 or that the employer has restricted or
15 attempted to restrict a former employee in the manner described in
16 subsection 2, the court shall award the employee or contractor
17 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Nothing in this subsection shall
18 be construed as prohibiting a court from otherwise awarding
19 attorney’s fees to a prevailing party pursuant to NRS 18.010.
