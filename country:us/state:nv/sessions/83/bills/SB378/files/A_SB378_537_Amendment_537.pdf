AN ACT relating to health care; revising requirements governing the electronic
maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information;
establishing a program to increase awareness of information
concerning independent centers for emergency medical care; requiring
certain facilities that are owned or operated by, or otherwise part of,
hospitals to be licensed as independent centers for emergency medical
care; requiring an independent center for emergency medical care to
provide urgent care services under certain conditions; prohibiting a
noncompetition covenant from applying to a [physician;] patient-
facing provider of health care; requiring a custodian of health
records to furnish health records within a specified period of time and
without charging a fee under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
2 prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange
3 of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures
4 and requirements for electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With
5 certain exceptions, existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including
6 persons and facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health
7 information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill
8 prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
9 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any other service
10 that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a person or entity or a patient
11 upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a custodian of health care records to furnish
12 electronic health records to a patient or another person or entity upon the request of a patient

Senate Amendment No. 537 to Senate Bill No. 378 Page 4
13 within 2 business days; and (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a
14 fee to furnish health care records under such circumstances.
15 Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must maintain,
16 transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical facilities and high-level
17 providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “high-level provider of health
18 care” to mean a physician, physician assistant, dentist, advanced practice registered nurse,
19 chiropractic physician, podiatric physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally
20 exempts from requirements to maintain, transmit and exchange health information
21 electronically high-level providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a
22 certain size . [or who work only in concierge medicine.] However, section 4 requires such
23 high-level providers of health care to furnish the medical records of a patient electronically to
24 the patient upon request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to
25 revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the licensing board of
26 a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the electronic maintenance,
27 transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2 of this bill establishes the
28 applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this
29 bill make other conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the
30 Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 32 of this bill updates internal references changed by
31 section 31.
32 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center for
33 emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and Behavioral
34 Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill requires a facility that [is
35 owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital that] is structurally separate from the
36 hospital and provides [limited] services for the treatment of a medical emergency , including
37 such a facility that is owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be
38 licensed as an independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030)
39 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
40 charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the Division
41 from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency medical care that is
42 located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for emergency medical care [.] or
43 a hospital with an emergency department. However, section 37 of this bill requires the
44 Division to issue a license to an independent center for emergency medical care that: (1) is
45 operating on January 1, 2026; (2) is newly required by section 14 to be licensed; and (3)
46 otherwise meets the requirements for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located.
47 Section 37 additionally requires the Division to issue a license to an independent center
48 for emergency medical care that has not yet been constructed, but whose owner or
49 operator has taken certain steps toward completing construction prior to January 1,
50 2026, and that otherwise meets the requirements for licensure at the time of the
51 application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located. Section 18 of this bill
52 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide urgent care services
53 during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements related to the provision
54 of such urgent care.
55 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information concerning
56 hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-439A.290) Section 9
57 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar program to increase awareness of
58 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12,
59 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the Department to collect certain information on the
60 operations of independent centers for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients
61 treated by independent centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting,
62 section 19 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
63 prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently required to use.
64 Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that independent centers for
65 emergency medical care will be using the same form. Sections 12 and 13 require the
66 Department to: (1) make certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
67 medical care available upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent
68 centers for emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
69 Section 23 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that
70 Internet website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
71 medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability of certain

Senate Amendment No. 537 to Senate Bill No. 378 Page 5
72 definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the Director on the status of
73 the programs to increase public awareness of information concerning hospitals and surgical
74 centers for ambulatory patients to additionally include information on the status of the
75 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for emergency
76 medical care.
77 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of certain
78 convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted of any additional
79 offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period of time; and (2) does not
80 have charges pending for any offense, except for minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245)
81 Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of an
82 arrest where the charges were dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person
83 who was arrested was acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the
84 Department or the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review
85 certain sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom the
86 records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or serve as an
87 officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of services.
88 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an action taken
89 against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section 27 of this bill requires
90 such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain documents to the Department for
91 the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or
92 recover money already paid if the Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this
93 bill: (1) prescribes a process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and
94 propriety; and (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to
95 such a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes a
96 conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 27 and 28 in the same
97 manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
98 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the covenant: (1) is
99 supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any restraint that is greater than is
100 required for the protection of the employer; (3) does not impose any undue hardship on the
101 employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that are appropriately related to the consideration for
102 the covenant. (NRS 613.195) Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant
103 may not apply to a [physician.] provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a
104 provider of health care whose primary duties involve clinical care to patients and who is
105 not employed or contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.
