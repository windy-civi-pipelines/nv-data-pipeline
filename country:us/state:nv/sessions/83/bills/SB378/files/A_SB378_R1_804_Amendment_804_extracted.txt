hospitals to be licensed as independent centers for emergency medical

emergency medical care to provide urgent care services under certain
conditions; authorizing the review of certain sealed records to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
2 prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange
Senate Amendment No. 804 to Senate Bill No. 378 First Reprint Page 4
3 of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures
4 and requirements for electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With
5 certain exceptions, existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including
6 persons and facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health
7 information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill
8 prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
9 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any other service
10 that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a person or entity or a patient
11 upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a custodian of health care records to furnish
12 electronic health records to a patient or [another person or] a covered entity upon the request
13 of a patient within [2] 7 business days; and (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records
14 from charging a fee to furnish health care records under such circumstances. Section 33
15 defines “covered entity” to refer to providers of health care who transmit health
16 information in electronic form, health insurers and certain other entities involved in the
17 processing of health information. (45 C.F.R. § 160.103)
18 Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must maintain,
19 transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical facilities and high-level
20 providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “high-level provider of health
21 care” to mean a physician, physician assistant, dentist, advanced practice registered nurse,
22 chiropractic physician, podiatric physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally
23 exempts from requirements to maintain, transmit and exchange health information
24 electronically high-level providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a
25 certain size. However, section 4 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish
26 the medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or entity upon
27 request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to revise the
28 applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the licensing board of a
29 provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the electronic maintenance,
30 transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2 of this bill establishes the
31 applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this
32 bill make other conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the
33 Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 32 of this bill updates internal references changed by
34 section 31.
35 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center for
36 emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and Behavioral
37 Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill requires a facility that is
38 structurally separate from the hospital and provides services for the treatment of a medical
39 emergency, including such a facility that is owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a
40 hospital, to be licensed as an independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151,
41 449.030) Sections 15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health
42 from charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the
43 Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency medical care
44 that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for emergency medical
45 care or a hospital with an emergency department. However, section 37 of this bill requires the
46 Division to issue a license to an independent center for emergency medical care that: (1) is
47 operating on [January 1, 2026;] the date on which this bill is enacted; (2) is newly required
48 by section 14 to be licensed; and (3) otherwise meets the requirements for licensure,
49 regardless of where the facility is located. Section 37 additionally requires the Division to
50 issue a license to an independent center for emergency medical care that has not yet been
51 constructed, but whose owner or operator [has] had taken certain steps toward completing
52 construction prior to January 1, [2026,] 2025, and that otherwise meets the requirements for
53 licensure at the time of the application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located.
54 Section 18 of this bill requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide
55 urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements
56 related to the provision of such urgent care [.] , except that section 36.5 of this bill exempts
57 independent centers for emergency medical care that are licensed on the date on which
58 this bill is enacted from that requirement.
59 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information concerning
60 hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-439A.290) Section 9
61 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar program to increase awareness of
Senate Amendment No. 804 to Senate Bill No. 378 First Reprint Page 5
62 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12,
63 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the Department to collect certain information on the
64 operations of independent centers for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients
65 treated by independent centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting,
66 section 19 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
67 prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently required to use.
68 Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that independent centers for
69 emergency medical care will be using the same form. Sections 12 and 13 require the
70 Department to: (1) make certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
71 medical care available upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent
72 centers for emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
73 Section 23 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that
74 Internet website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
75 medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability of certain
76 definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the Director on the status of
77 the programs to increase public awareness of information concerning hospitals and surgical
78 centers for ambulatory patients to additionally include information on the status of the
79 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for emergency
80 medical care. Section 26.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department, to the
81 extent that money is available, to include under Medicaid a system of value-based
82 payments for care provided by independent centers for emergency medical care to
83 recipients of Medicaid.
84 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of certain
85 convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted of any additional
86 offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period of time; and (2) does not
87 have charges pending for any offense, except for minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245)
88 Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of an
89 arrest where the charges were dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person
90 who was arrested was acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the
91 Department or the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review
92 certain sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom the
93 records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or serve as an
94 officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of services.
95 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an action taken
96 against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section 27 of this bill requires
97 such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain documents to the Department for
98 the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or
99 recover money already paid if the Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this
100 bill: (1) prescribes a process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and
101 propriety; and (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to
102 such a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes a
103 conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 26.5, 27 and 28 in the same
104 manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 36.2 of this bill makes an
105 appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department
106 and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out sections 26.5, 27 and
107 28.
108 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the covenant: (1) is
109 supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any restraint that is greater than is
110 required for the protection of the employer; (3) does not impose any undue hardship on the
111 employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that are appropriately related to the consideration for
112 the covenant. (NRS 613.195) Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant
113 may not apply to a provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a provider of health
114 care whose primary duties involve clinical care to patients and who is not employed or
115 contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; revising requirements governing the electronic
maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information;
establishing a program to increase awareness of information
concerning independent centers for emergency medical care; requiring
certain facilities that are owned or operated by, or otherwise part of,
hospitals to be licensed as independent centers for emergency medical
care; requiring [an] certain independent [center] centers for
emergency medical care to provide urgent care services under certain
conditions; authorizing the review of certain sealed records to
determine the suitability of a person to provide services under
Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to include a system of value-based
payments for independent centers for emergency medical care;
requiring a provider of services under Medicaid to maintain
certain records; authorizing audits of such records, the review and
denial of claims under Medicaid and the recovery of money paid
under Medicaid under certain circumstances; prohibiting a
noncompetition covenant from applying to a patient-facing provider of
health care; requiring a custodian of health records to furnish health
records within a specified period of time and without charging a fee
under certain circumstances; making an appropriation; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
2 prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange

Senate Amendment No. 804 to Senate Bill No. 378 First Reprint Page 4
3 of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures
4 and requirements for electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With
5 certain exceptions, existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including
6 persons and facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health
7 information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill
8 prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
9 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any other service
10 that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a person or entity or a patient
11 upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a custodian of health care records to furnish
12 electronic health records to a patient or [another person or] a covered entity upon the request
13 of a patient within [2] 7 business days; and (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records
14 from charging a fee to furnish health care records under such circumstances. Section 33
15 defines “covered entity” to refer to providers of health care who transmit health
16 information in electronic form, health insurers and certain other entities involved in the
17 processing of health information. (45 C.F.R. § 160.103)
18 Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must maintain,
19 transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical facilities and high-level
20 providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “high-level provider of health
21 care” to mean a physician, physician assistant, dentist, advanced practice registered nurse,
22 chiropractic physician, podiatric physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally
23 exempts from requirements to maintain, transmit and exchange health information
24 electronically high-level providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a
25 certain size. However, section 4 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish
26 the medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or entity upon
27 request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to revise the
28 applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the licensing board of a
29 provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the electronic maintenance,
30 transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2 of this bill establishes the
31 applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this
32 bill make other conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the
33 Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 32 of this bill updates internal references changed by
34 section 31.
35 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center for
36 emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and Behavioral
37 Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill requires a facility that is
38 structurally separate from the hospital and provides services for the treatment of a medical
39 emergency, including such a facility that is owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a
40 hospital, to be licensed as an independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151,
41 449.030) Sections 15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health
42 from charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the
43 Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency medical care
44 that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for emergency medical
45 care or a hospital with an emergency department. However, section 37 of this bill requires the
46 Division to issue a license to an independent center for emergency medical care that: (1) is
47 operating on [January 1, 2026;] the date on which this bill is enacted; (2) is newly required
48 by section 14 to be licensed; and (3) otherwise meets the requirements for licensure,
49 regardless of where the facility is located. Section 37 additionally requires the Division to
50 issue a license to an independent center for emergency medical care that has not yet been
51 constructed, but whose owner or operator [has] had taken certain steps toward completing
52 construction prior to January 1, [2026,] 2025, and that otherwise meets the requirements for
53 licensure at the time of the application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located.
54 Section 18 of this bill requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide
55 urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements
56 related to the provision of such urgent care [.] , except that section 36.5 of this bill exempts
57 independent centers for emergency medical care that are licensed on the date on which
58 this bill is enacted from that requirement.
59 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information concerning
60 hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-439A.290) Section 9
61 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar program to increase awareness of

Senate Amendment No. 804 to Senate Bill No. 378 First Reprint Page 5
62 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12,
63 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the Department to collect certain information on the
64 operations of independent centers for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients
65 treated by independent centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting,
66 section 19 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
67 prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently required to use.
68 Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that independent centers for
69 emergency medical care will be using the same form. Sections 12 and 13 require the
70 Department to: (1) make certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
71 medical care available upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent
72 centers for emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
73 Section 23 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that
74 Internet website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
75 medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability of certain
76 definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the Director on the status of
77 the programs to increase public awareness of information concerning hospitals and surgical
78 centers for ambulatory patients to additionally include information on the status of the
79 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for emergency
80 medical care. Section 26.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department, to the
81 extent that money is available, to include under Medicaid a system of value-based
82 payments for care provided by independent centers for emergency medical care to
83 recipients of Medicaid.
84 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of certain
85 convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted of any additional
86 offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period of time; and (2) does not
87 have charges pending for any offense, except for minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245)
88 Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of an
89 arrest where the charges were dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person
90 who was arrested was acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the
91 Department or the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review
92 certain sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom the
93 records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or serve as an
94 officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of services.
95 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an action taken
96 against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section 27 of this bill requires
97 such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain documents to the Department for
98 the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or
99 recover money already paid if the Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this
100 bill: (1) prescribes a process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and
101 propriety; and (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to
102 such a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes a
103 conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 26.5, 27 and 28 in the same
104 manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 36.2 of this bill makes an
105 appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department
106 and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out sections 26.5, 27 and
107 28.
108 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the covenant: (1) is
109 supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any restraint that is greater than is
110 required for the protection of the employer; (3) does not impose any undue hardship on the
111 employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that are appropriately related to the consideration for
112 the covenant. (NRS 613.195) Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant
113 may not apply to a provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a provider of health
114 care whose primary duties involve clinical care to patients and who is not employed or
115 contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.
