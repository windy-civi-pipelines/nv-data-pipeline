Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
2 Services to prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance,
3 transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related
-
*SB378_R1*

– 2 –
4 information and electronic signatures and requirements for electronic equivalents of
5 written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions, existing law requires
6 various entities involved in health care, including persons and facilities that provide
7 health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance
8 with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill prohibits those
9 regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
10 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any
11 other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a
12 person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a
13 custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or
14 another person or entity upon the request of a patient within 2 business days; and
15 (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health
16 care records under such circumstances.
17 Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
18 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
19 facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
20 term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
21 dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
22 physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally exempts from requirements
23 to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
24 providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a certain size.
25 However, section 4 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish the
26 medical records of a patient electronically to the patient upon request of the patient.
27 Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to revise the applicability of a
28 provision requiring the Department to notify the licensing board of a provider who
29 fails to comply with requirements governing the electronic maintenance, transmittal
30 and exchange of health information. Section 2 of this bill establishes the
31 applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and
32 36 of this bill make other conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of
33 section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 32 of this bill updates internal
34 references changed by section 31.
35 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
36 for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
37 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill
38 requires a facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides
39 services for the treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is
40 owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an
41 independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections
42 15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
43 charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the
44 Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency
45 medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for
46 emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency department. However,
47 section 37 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
48 center for emergency medical care that: (1) is operating on January 1, 2026; (2) is
49 newly required by section 14 to be licensed; and (3) otherwise meets the
50 requirements for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located. Section 37
51 additionally requires the Division to issue a license to an independent center for
52 emergency medical care that has not yet been constructed, but whose owner or
53 operator has taken certain steps toward completing construction prior to January 1,
54 2026, and that otherwise meets the requirements for licensure at the time of the
55 application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located. Section 18 of
56 this bill requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide
57 urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional
58 requirements related to the provision of such urgent care.

59 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
60 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
61 439A.290) Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
62 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
63 emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the
64 Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent centers
65 for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent
66 centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 19
67 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
68 prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently
69 required to use. Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that
70 independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same form.
71 Sections 12 and 13 require the Department to: (1) make certain information
72 concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available upon request;
73 and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
74 medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department. Section 23 of
75 this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that Internet
76 website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
77 medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability
78 of certain definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the
79 Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
80 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally
81 include information on the status of the program to increase awareness of
82 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care.
83 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
84 of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
85 of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified
86 period of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for
87 minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
88 petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
89 dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
90 acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
91 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
92 sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
93 the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
94 serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
95 services.
96 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
97 action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
98 27 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
99 documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27
100 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
101 Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
102 process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
103 (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
104 a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes
105 a conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 27 and 28 in the
106 same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
107 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
108 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
109 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
110 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
111 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
112 Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
113 provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a provider of health care whose
-

115 contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.

19 provisions of this subsection is void and unenforceable.

40 protection of the employer for whose benefit the restraint is imposed
41 or imposes undue hardship on the employee, the court shall revise
42 the covenant to the extent necessary and enforce the covenant as
