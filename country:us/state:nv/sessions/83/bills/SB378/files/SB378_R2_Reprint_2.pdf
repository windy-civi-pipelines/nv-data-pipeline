health care; requiring a custodian of health records to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
2 Services to prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance,
3 transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related
4 information and electronic signatures and requirements for electronic equivalents of
5 written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions, existing law requires
6 various entities involved in health care, including persons and facilities that provide
7 health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance
8 with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill prohibits those
9 regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
10 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any
11 other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a
12 person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a
13 custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or
14 a covered entity upon the request of a patient within 7 business days; and (2)
15 prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health
16 care records under such circumstances. Section 33 defines “covered entity” to refer
17 to providers of health care who transmit health information in electronic form,
18 health insurers and certain other entities involved in the processing of health
19 information. (45 C.F.R. § 160.103)
20 Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
21 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
22 facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
23 term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
24 dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
25 physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally exempts from requirements
26 to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
27 providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a certain size.
28 However, section 4 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish the
29 medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or entity
30 upon request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to
31 revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the
32 licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the
33 electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2
34 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and
35 sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this bill make other conforming changes to
36 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section
37 32 of this bill updates internal references changed by section 31.
38 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
39 for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
40 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill
41 requires a facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides
42 services for the treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is
43 owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an
44 independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections
45 15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
46 charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the
47 Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency
-
*SB378_R2*

– 3 –
48 medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for
49 emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency department. However,
50 section 37 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
51 center for emergency medical care that: (1) is operating on the date on which this
52 bill is enacted; (2) is newly required by section 14 to be licensed; and (3) otherwise
53 meets the requirements for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located.
54 Section 37 additionally requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
55 center for emergency medical care that has not yet been constructed, but whose
56 owner or operator had taken certain steps toward completing construction prior to
57 January 1, 2025, and that otherwise meets the requirements for licensure at the time
58 of the application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located. Section
59 18 of this bill requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide
60 urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional
61 requirements related to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 36.5
62 of this bill exempts independent centers for emergency medical care that are
63 licensed on the date on which this bill is enacted from that requirement.
64 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
65 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
66 439A.290) Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
67 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
68 emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the
69 Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent centers
70 for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent
71 centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 19
72 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
73 prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently
74 required to use. Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that
75 independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same form.
76 Sections 12 and 13 require the Department to: (1) make certain information
77 concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available upon request;
78 and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
79 medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department. Section 23 of
80 this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that Internet
81 website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
82 medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability
83 of certain definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the
84 Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
85 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally
86 include information on the status of the program to increase awareness of
87 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Section
88 26.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department, to the extent that money is
89 available, to include under Medicaid a system of value-based payments for care
90 provided by independent centers for emergency medical care to recipients of
91 Medicaid.
92 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
93 of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
94 of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified
95 period of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for
96 minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
97 petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
98 dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
99 acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
100 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
101 sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
102 the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
-
*SB378_R2*

– 4 –
103 serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
104 services.
105 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
106 action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
107 27 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
108 documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27
109 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
110 Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
111 process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
112 (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
113 a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes
114 a conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 26.5, 27 and 28
115 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 36.2 of this
116 bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of
117 the Department and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out
118 sections 26.5, 27 and 28.
119 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
120 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
121 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
122 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
123 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
124 Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
125 provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a provider of health care whose
126 primary duties involve clinical care to patients and who is not employed or
127 contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.
