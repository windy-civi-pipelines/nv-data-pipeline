Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
Services to prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance,
transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related
information and electronic signatures and requirements for electronic equivalents of
written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions, existing law requires
various entities involved in health care, including persons and facilities that provide
health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance
with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill prohibits those
regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any
other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a
person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a
custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or
a covered entity upon the request of a patient within 7 business days; and (2)
prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health
care records under such circumstances. Section 33 defines “covered entity” to refer
to providers of health care who transmit health information in electronic form,
-

– 2 –
health insurers and certain other entities involved in the processing of health
information. (45 C.F.R. § 160.103)

Section 2:
Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally exempts from requirements
to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a certain size.
However, section 4 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish the
medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or entity
upon request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to
revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the
licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the
electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2
of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and

Section 3:
sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this bill make other conforming changes to
indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section
32 of this bill updates internal references changed by section 31.
Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill
requires a facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides
services for the treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is
owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an
independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections
15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the
Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency
medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for
emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency department. However,

Section 4:
section 37 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
center for emergency medical care that: (1) is operating on the date on which this
bill is enacted; (2) is newly required by section 14 to be licensed; and (3) otherwise
meets the requirements for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located.

Section 5:
Section 37 additionally requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
center for emergency medical care that has not yet been constructed, but whose
owner or operator had taken certain steps toward completing construction prior to
January 1, 2025, and that otherwise meets the requirements for licensure at the time
of the application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located. Section
18 of this bill requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide
urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional
requirements related to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 36.5
of this bill exempts independent centers for emergency medical care that are
licensed on the date on which this bill is enacted from that requirement.
Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
439A.290) Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the
Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent centers
for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 19
requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently
required to use. Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that
independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same form.

Section 6:
Sections 12 and 13 require the Department to: (1) make certain information
concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available upon request;
and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department. Section 23 of
this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that Internet
website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability
of certain definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the
Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally
include information on the status of the program to increase awareness of
information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Section

Section 7:
26.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department, to the extent that money is
available, to include under Medicaid a system of value-based payments for care
provided by independent centers for emergency medical care to recipients of
Medicaid.
Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified
period of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for
minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
services.
Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
27 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27
authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
(2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes
a conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 26.5, 27 and 28
in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 36.2 of this
bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of
the Department and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out

Section 8:
sections 26.5, 27 and 28.
Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)

Section 9:
Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a provider of health care whose
primary duties involve clinical care to patients and who is not employed or
contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.

Senate Bill No. 378–Senators Doñate, Cruz-Crawford, Nguyen,
Flores; Cannizzaro, Lange and Ohrenschall
Joint Sponsor: Assemblymember Gray
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; revising requirements governing
the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of
health information; establishing a program to increase
awareness of information concerning independent centers for
emergency medical care; requiring certain facilities that are
owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, hospitals to be
licensed as independent centers for emergency medical care;
requiring certain independent centers for emergency medical
care to provide urgent care services under certain conditions;
authorizing the review of certain sealed records to determine
the suitability of a person to provide services under
Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to include a system of value-
based payments for independent centers for emergency
medical care; requiring a provider of services under Medicaid
to maintain certain records; authorizing audits of such
records, the review and denial of claims under Medicaid and
the recovery of money paid under Medicaid under certain
circumstances; prohibiting a noncompetition covenant from
applying to a patient-facing provider of health care; requiring
a custodian of health records to furnish health records within
a specified period of time and without charging a fee under
certain circumstances; making an appropriation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
Services to prescribe by regulation a framework for the electronic maintenance,
transmittal and exchange of electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related
information and electronic signatures and requirements for electronic equivalents of
written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions, existing law requires
various entities involved in health care, including persons and facilities that provide
health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health information in accordance
with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 5 of this bill prohibits those
regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any
other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a
person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 33 of this bill: (1) requires a
custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or
a covered entity upon the request of a patient within 7 business days; and (2)
prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health
care records under such circumstances. Section 33 defines “covered entity” to refer
to providers of health care who transmit health information in electronic form,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
health insurers and certain other entities involved in the processing of health
information. (45 C.F.R. § 160.103)
Sections 4, 31 and 40 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
physician or physical therapist. Section 4 additionally exempts from requirements
to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a certain size.
However, section 4 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish the
medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or entity
upon request of the patient. Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to
revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify the
licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing the
electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information. Section 2
of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth in section 1, and
sections 24, 25, 29, 35 and 36 of this bill make other conforming changes to
indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section
32 of this bill updates internal references changed by section 31.
Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 14 of this bill
requires a facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides
services for the treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is
owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an
independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections
15 and 16 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 17 of this bill prohibits the
Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency
medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for
emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency department. However,
section 37 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
center for emergency medical care that: (1) is operating on the date on which this
bill is enacted; (2) is newly required by section 14 to be licensed; and (3) otherwise
meets the requirements for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located.
Section 37 additionally requires the Division to issue a license to an independent
center for emergency medical care that has not yet been constructed, but whose
owner or operator had taken certain steps toward completing construction prior to
January 1, 2025, and that otherwise meets the requirements for licensure at the time
of the application for licensure, regardless of where the facility is located. Section
18 of this bill requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide
urgent care services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional
requirements related to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 36.5
of this bill exempts independent centers for emergency medical care that are
licensed on the date on which this bill is enacted from that requirement.
Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
439A.290) Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
emergency medical care. Sections 9, 10, 12, 13 and 19 of this bill provide for the
Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent centers
for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 19
requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the same form
prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is currently
required to use. Section 34 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that
independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same form.
Sections 12 and 13 require the Department to: (1) make certain information
concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available upon request;
and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for emergency
medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department. Section 23 of
this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the revised content of that Internet
website. Section 8 of this bill defines the term “independent center for emergency
medical care” for that purpose. Section 11 of this bill establishes the applicability
of certain definitions. Section 20 of this bill requires a report prepared by the
Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally
include information on the status of the program to increase awareness of
information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Section
26.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department, to the extent that money is
available, to include under Medicaid a system of value-based payments for care
provided by independent centers for emergency medical care to recipients of
Medicaid.
Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified
period of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for
minor traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 21 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
services.
Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
27 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 27
authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 28 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
(2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 22 of this bill makes
a conforming change to require the Director to administer sections 26.5, 27 and 28
in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Section 36.2 of this
bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of
the Department and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out
sections 26.5, 27 and 28.
Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
Section 30 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
provider of health care, which section 30 defines as a provider of health care whose
primary duties involve clinical care to patients and who is not employed or
contracted to primarily perform administrative tasks.
