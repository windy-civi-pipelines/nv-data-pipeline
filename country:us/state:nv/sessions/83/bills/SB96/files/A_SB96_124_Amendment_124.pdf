AN ACT relating to days of observance; designating January 27 of each year as

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, certain days, weeks and months of observance are recognized in this
2 State. (NRS 236.018-236.095) This bill designates January 27 of each year as “International
3 Holocaust Remembrance Day” in the State of Nevada and requires the Governor to issue
4 annually a proclamation encouraging the observance of this day.
1 WHEREAS, The Holocaust was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored
2 persecution and murder of approximately 6,000,000 Jewish persons and 5,000,000
3 other persons by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945; and
4 WHEREAS, Other horrific genocides have occurred throughout history in places
5 such as Armenia, Cambodia, Darfur, Guatemala and Rwanda; and
6 WHEREAS, In 2005, the United Nations General Assembly designated January
7 27, which is the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, as
8 International Holocaust Remembrance Day to commemorate the victims of the
9 Holocaust and to promote education about the Holocaust throughout the world; and
10 WHEREAS, A survey released in 2024 by the Governor’s Advisory Council on
11 Education Relating to the Holocaust revealed a significant lack of knowledge about
12 the Holocaust and other genocides among Nevadans, particularly the younger
13 generation; and
14 WHEREAS, Assembly Bill No. 231 was enacted during the 81st (2021) Session
15 of the Nevada Legislature to direct efforts to improve the curricula of courses
16 provided to pupils in Nevada about the Holocaust and other genocides as well as to

1 increase the classroom resources and professional development courses available to
2 educators on genocide education; and
3 WHEREAS, The annual observance of International Holocaust Remembrance
4 Day in Nevada will preserve the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and other
5 genocides and promote public knowledge of these atrocities as well as serve as a
6 reminder for continued vigilance against hatred, persecution and tyranny to prevent
7 their reoccurrence; now, therefore,
