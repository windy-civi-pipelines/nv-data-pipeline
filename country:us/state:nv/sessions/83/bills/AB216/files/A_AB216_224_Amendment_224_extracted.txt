14 committing the battery.

8 other person to whom you are related by blood or marriage, a person with whom
9 you have had or are having a dating relationship or a person with whom you have a

13 am required, unless mitigating circumstances exist, to arrest the person suspected of
14 committing the battery.
15 (3) If I have probable cause to believe that a battery has been committed
