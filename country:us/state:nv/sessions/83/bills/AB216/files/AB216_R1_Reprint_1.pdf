3 domestic violence. (NRS 171.1225) Section 2 of this bill requires a peace officer
4 investigating an act of domestic violence to complete a lethality assessment form

6 officer has probable cause to believe that the person believed to have committed the

15 Existing law requires a peace officer who investigates an act of domestic
16 violence to prepare and submit to certain persons a written report of the

20 card provided pursuant to subsection 2, the peace officer shall
21 document this information on the lethality assessment form.

23 who has completed relevant training and who, with or without
24 compensation, works for:

8 a peace officer shall:
9 (a) Make a good faith effort to explain the provisions of NRS
10 171.137 pertaining to domestic violence and advise victims of all
11 reasonable means to prevent further abuse, including advising each
12 person of the availability of a shelter or other services in the
13 community.
14 (b) Provide a person suspected of being the victim of an act of
15 domestic violence with a written copy of the following statements:
16 (1) My name is Officer ......................... (naming the

23 are related by blood or marriage, a person with whom you have had
24 or are having a dating relationship or a person with whom you have
25 a child in common, and if I had a face-to-face encounter with the

27 duration to determine whether probable cause existed while
28 responding to the initial incident or call for service, I am required,
29 unless mitigating circumstances exist, to arrest the person suspected
30 of committing the battery.
31 (3) If I have probable cause to believe that a battery has been

8 against further threats or acts of domestic violence. You do not need

2 protection.
3 (9) If the person who committed or threatened the act of

6 (I) The arresting officer determines that such a violation
7 is accompanied by a direct or indirect threat of harm;

13 substance in the person’s blood or urine, as applicable, that is equal
14 to or greater than the amount set forth in subsection 3 or 4 of
15 NRS 484C.110,
16  the person will not be admitted to bail sooner than 12 hours after
17 arrest.
18 (10) You may obtain emergency assistance or shelter by
19 contacting your local program against domestic violence at

21 program) or you may call, without charge to you, the Statewide
22 Program Against Domestic Violence at ........................ (state toll-
23 free telephone number of Statewide Program).
24 (c) Complete a lethality assessment form for a person

29 (2) A person with whom he or she had or is having a dating
30 relationship; or
31 (3) A person with whom he or she has a child in common.
32 2. The failure of a peace officer to carry out the requirements
33 set forth in subsection 1 is not a defense in a criminal prosecution
34 for the commission of an act of domestic violence, nor may such an
35 omission be considered as negligence or as causation in any civil
36 action against the peace officer or the officer’s employer.
37 3. As used in this section:
38 (a) “Act of domestic violence” means any of the following acts
39 committed by a person against his or her spouse, former spouse, any
