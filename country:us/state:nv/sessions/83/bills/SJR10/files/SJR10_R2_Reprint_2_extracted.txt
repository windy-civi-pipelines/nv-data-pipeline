SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to take certain
actions relating to the therapeutic use of certain
psychedelic compounds.
1 WHEREAS, Mental health conditions, including post-traumatic
2 stress disorder (PTSD), treatment-resistant depression, anxiety
3 disorders and substance use disorders, affect millions of Americans,
4 including veterans, first responders and other residents of Nevada;
5 and
6 WHEREAS, Conventional treatments for these mental health
7 conditions often prove inadequate for many patients, leaving such
8 patients without effective therapeutic options; and
9 WHEREAS, Preliminary research has indicated that certain
10 psychedelic compounds, including psilocybin, psilocin, N,N-
11 dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ibogaine, mescaline and 3,4-
12 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), when administered in
-
*SJR10_R2*
– 2 –
1 controlled clinical settings, show promising therapeutic potential for
2 treating various mental health conditions; and
3 WHEREAS, The United States Food and Drug Administration
4 has granted, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, MDMA-assisted
5 therapy for PTSD, psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant
6 depression and psilocybin therapy for major depressive disorder
7 Breakthrough Therapy designation, thereby acknowledging the
8 potential of those treatments to offer substantial improvement over
9 existing treatments and expediting their development and review;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, Multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials have
12 demonstrated the safety and efficacy of certain psychedelic-assisted
13 therapy, with trials showing that MDMA-assisted therapy led to 67
14 percent of patients with severe PTSD no longer meeting diagnostic
15 criteria after treatment, and psilocybin-assisted therapy
16 demonstrated a 75 percent response rate and a 58 percent remission
17 rate in patients with major depressive disorder at 12 months; and
18 WHEREAS, Researchers at Stanford University demonstrated
19 that ibogaine treatment led to significant improvements in veterans
20 with traumatic brain injury and PTSD, with participants
21 experiencing average reductions of 88 percent in symptoms of
22 PTSD, of 87 percent in symptoms of depression and of 81 percent in
23 symptoms of anxiety at their 1-month follow-up; and
24 WHEREAS, Multiple studies focused on veterans conducted at
25 leading institutions have shown promising results for treating PTSD
26 related to combat and traumatic brain injury with psychedelic
27 compounds, including recent breakthrough findings published in
28 Nature Medicine regarding magnesium-stabilized ibogaine for the
29 treatment of traumatic brain injury; and
30 WHEREAS, Clinical research has demonstrated significant
31 potential for psychedelic compounds to address chronic pain
32 conditions, with studies showing that the pulse administration of
33 psilocybin reduced the frequency of cluster headache attacks by
34 approximately 50 percent from baseline, from an average of 18.4
35 attacks to 9.8 attacks per week, and MDMA-assisted therapy
36 produced significant reductions in the pain intensity, disability and
37 overall pain severity of patients with PTSD with high baseline pain
38 levels; and
39 WHEREAS, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
40 Year 2024, Public Law 118-31, directed the Department of Defense
41 to establish a process for service members to participate in clinical
42 trials studying psychedelic compounds, including psilocybin and
43 MDMA, for treating PTSD and traumatic brain injury, allocated
44 $10,000,000 in funding and authorized partnerships with other
-
*SJR10_R2*
– 3 –
1 agencies and academic institutions, thereby demonstrating growing
2 federal recognition of the potential of these treatments; and
3 WHEREAS, The Department of Veterans Affairs has partnered
4 with researchers at Brown University and Yale University to
5 conduct a 5-year study, at the cost of $1,500,000, at the Providence
6 VA Medical Center and West Haven VA Medical Center evaluating
7 MDMA-assisted therapy for veterans with co-occurring PTSD and
8 alcohol use disorder, representing the first research initiative
9 involving psychedelic-assisted therapy funded by the Department
10 since the 1960s, and which was part of a broader effort announced
11 in January 2025 to investigate the safety and efficacy of psychedelic
12 compounds for treating veterans with mental health conditions; and
13 WHEREAS, Extensive research has demonstrated that classic
14 psychedelics have low abuse potential, with studies showing no
15 physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms and clinical evidence
16 indicating that psychedelic compounds can effectively treat
17 substance use disorders; and
18 WHEREAS, Clinical research demonstrates that psychedelic
19 compounds like psilocybin and MDMA have a favorable safety
20 profile when administered in controlled clinical settings with
21 appropriate medical screening and supervision, with studies
22 showing no lasting neuropsychological deficits, organ damage or
23 serious adverse reactions and a significantly lower rate of adverse
24 medical events compared to many current standard treatments; and
25 WHEREAS, Schedule I classification under the Controlled
26 Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq., designates a substance as
27 having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for
28 abuse; and
29 WHEREAS, Controlled substances classified in schedule I are
30 subject to significant barriers to research, including more
31 burdensome regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles than research of
32 other controlled substances; and
33 WHEREAS, Physicians cannot access controlled substances
34 classified in schedule I to treat patients who have terminal or life-
35 threatening conditions under the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello,
36 Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017
37 (“Right to Try Act”), Public Law 115-176, even if the controlled
38 substance is otherwise an eligible investigational drug under the
39 Act; and
40 WHEREAS, The low potential for abuse of psychedelic
41 compounds and evidence of their medical utility, particularly the
42 designation of Breakthrough Therapies by the United States Food
43 and Drug Administration, contradicts their classification as schedule
44 I controlled substances; and
-
*SJR10_R2*
– 4 –
1 WHEREAS, Leading medical research institutions have
2 established dedicated centers for psychedelic research, including the
3 Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research,
4 the Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation at the Petrie-Flom
5 Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at

15 Center for Psychedelic Research and Therapy at Dell Medical
16 School at the University of Texas at Austin and the Washington
17 University Program in Psychedelics Research; and
18 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada recognizes the urgent need to
19 address the mental health crisis and expand treatment options for
20 those in need; now, therefore, be it
21 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
22 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges the
23 Congress of the United States and the appropriate federal agencies
24 to:
25 1. Increase federal funding for research into the therapeutic
26 applications of psychedelic compounds, particularly for treating
27 mental health conditions, substance use disorders and chronic pain;
28 2. Establish a streamlined process for approving and
29 conducting research with psychedelic compounds, while
30 maintaining appropriate safety protocols and oversight;
31 3. Establish a process to allow for compassionate medical use
32 of psychedelic eligible investigational drugs under the Right to Try
33 Act, while maintaining appropriate safety protocols and oversight;
34 4. Reschedule psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, ibogaine, mescaline
35 and MDMA to a schedule that better reflects the therapeutic value,
36 low potential for abuse and safety for use under medical supervision
37 of those compounds, giving priority to the rescheduling of
38 compounds that have received Breakthrough Therapy designation
39 from the United States Food and Drug Administration; and
40 5. Establish legal protection against federal prosecution for
41 individuals and entities complying with state and local law
42 concerning the supervised adult use of psychedelic compounds and
43 require states to enter research partnerships with the Attorney
44 General under the Controlled Substances Act to study the public
