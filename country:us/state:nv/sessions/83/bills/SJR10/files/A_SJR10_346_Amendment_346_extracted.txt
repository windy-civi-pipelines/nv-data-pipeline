SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to take certain actions relating
to the therapeutic use of certain psychedelic compounds.
1 WHEREAS, Mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder
2 (PTSD), treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders and substance use
3 disorders, affect millions of Americans, including veterans, first responders and
4 other residents of Nevada; and
5 WHEREAS, Conventional treatments for these mental health conditions often
6 prove inadequate for many patients, leaving such patients without effective
7 therapeutic options; and
8 WHEREAS, Preliminary research has indicated that certain psychedelic
9 compounds, including psilocybin, psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT),
10 ibogaine, mescaline and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), when
11 administered in controlled clinical settings, show promising therapeutic potential
12 for treating various mental health conditions; and
13 WHEREAS, The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted, in
14 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, psilocybin
15 therapy for treatment-resistant depression and psilocybin therapy for major
16 depressive disorder Breakthrough Therapy designation, thereby acknowledging the
17 potential of those treatments to offer substantial improvement over existing
18 treatments and expediting their development and review; and
19 WHEREAS, Multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated the
20 safety and efficacy of certain psychedelic-assisted therapy, with trials showing that
21 MDMA-assisted therapy led to 67 percent of patients with severe PTSD no longer
22 meeting diagnostic criteria after treatment, and psilocybin-assisted therapy [led to a
Senate Amendment No. 346 to Senate Joint Resolution No. 10 Page 4
1 71-percent reduction in] demonstrated a 75 percent response rate and a 58
2 percent remission rate in patients with major depressive [symptoms at 1 week
3 post-treatment for patients with treatment-resistant depression, with 58 percent of
4 patients maintaining significant improvement] disorder at [their 3-month follow-
5 up;] 12 months; and
6 WHEREAS, Researchers at Stanford University demonstrated that ibogaine
7 treatment led to significant improvements in veterans with traumatic brain injury
8 and PTSD, with participants experiencing average reductions of 88 percent in
9 symptoms of PTSD, of 87 percent in symptoms of depression and of 81 percent in
10 symptoms of anxiety at their 1-month follow-up; and
11 WHEREAS, Multiple studies focused on veterans conducted at leading
12 institutions have shown promising results for treating PTSD related to combat and
13 traumatic brain injury with psychedelic compounds, including recent breakthrough
14 findings published in Nature Medicine regarding magnesium-stabilized ibogaine for
15 the treatment of traumatic brain injury; and
16 WHEREAS, Clinical research has demonstrated significant potential for
17 psychedelic compounds to address chronic pain conditions, with studies showing
18 that the pulse administration of psilocybin reduced the frequency of cluster
19 headache attacks by approximately 50 percent from baseline, from an average of
20 18.4 attacks to 9.8 attacks per week, and MDMA-assisted therapy produced
21 significant reductions in the pain intensity, disability and overall pain severity of
22 patients with PTSD with high baseline pain levels; and
23 WHEREAS, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024,
24 Public Law 118-31, directed the Department of Defense to establish a process for
25 service members to participate in clinical trials studying psychedelic compounds,
26 including psilocybin and MDMA, for treating PTSD and traumatic brain injury,
27 allocated $10,000,000 in funding and authorized partnerships with other agencies
28 and academic institutions, thereby demonstrating growing federal recognition of the
29 potential of these treatments; and
30 WHEREAS, The Department of Veterans Affairs has partnered with researchers
31 at Brown University and Yale University to conduct a 5-year study, at the cost of
32 $1,500,000, at the Providence VA Medical Center and West Haven VA Medical
33 Center evaluating MDMA-assisted therapy for veterans with co-occurring PTSD
34 and alcohol use disorder, representing the first research initiative involving
35 psychedelic-assisted therapy funded by the Department since the 1960s, and which
36 was part of a broader effort announced in January 2025 to investigate the safety and
37 efficacy of psychedelic compounds for treating veterans with mental health
38 conditions; and
39 WHEREAS, Extensive research has demonstrated that classic psychedelics have
40 low abuse potential, with studies showing no physical dependence or withdrawal
41 symptoms and clinical evidence indicating that psychedelic compounds can
42 effectively treat substance use disorders; and
43 WHEREAS, Clinical research demonstrates that psychedelic compounds like
44 psilocybin and MDMA have a favorable safety profile when administered in
45 controlled clinical settings with appropriate medical screening and supervision,
46 with studies showing no lasting neuropsychological deficits, organ damage or
47 serious adverse reactions and a significantly lower rate of adverse medical events
48 compared to many current standard treatments; and
49 WHEREAS, Schedule I classification under the Controlled Substances Act, 21
50 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq., designates a substance as having no currently accepted
51 medical use and a high potential for abuse; and
Senate Amendment No. 346 to Senate Joint Resolution No. 10 Page 5
1 WHEREAS, Controlled substances classified in schedule I are subject to
2 significant barriers to research, including more burdensome regulatory and
3 bureaucratic hurdles than research of other controlled substances; and
4 WHEREAS, Physicians cannot access controlled substances classified in
5 schedule I to treat patients who have terminal or life-threatening conditions under
6 the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right
7 to Try Act of 2017 (“Right to Try Act”), Public Law 115-176, even if the controlled
8 substance is otherwise an eligible investigational drug under the Act; and
9 WHEREAS, The low potential for abuse of psychedelic compounds and
10 evidence of their medical utility, particularly the designation of Breakthrough
11 Therapies by the United States Food and Drug Administration, contradicts their
12 classification as schedule I controlled substances; and
13 WHEREAS, Leading medical research institutions have established dedicated
14 centers for psychedelic research, including the Johns Hopkins Center for
15 Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, the Project on Psychedelics Law and
16 Regulation at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and
17 Bioethics at Harvard Law School, the University of California Berkeley Center for
18 the Science of Psychedelics, the New York University Langone Health’s Center for
19 Psychedelic Medicine, the Parsons Research Center for Psychedelic Healing at the
20 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the Yale Program for Psychedelic
21 Science, the University of Wisconsin-Madison Transdisciplinary Center for
22 Research in Psychoactive Substances, the Stanford Psychedelic Science Group, the
23 Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics, the
24 Charmaine and Gordon McGill Center for Psychedelic Research and Therapy at
25 Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin and the Washington
26 University Program in Psychedelics Research; and
27 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada recognizes the urgent need to address the
28 mental health crisis and expand treatment options for those in need; now, therefore,
29 be it
30 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
31 That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges the Congress of the United States and the
32 appropriate federal agencies to:
33 1. Increase federal funding for research into the therapeutic applications of
34 psychedelic compounds, particularly for treating mental health conditions,
35 substance use disorders and chronic pain;
36 2. Establish a streamlined process for approving and conducting research with
37 psychedelic compounds, while maintaining appropriate safety protocols and
38 oversight;
39 3. Establish a process to allow for compassionate medical use of psychedelic
40 eligible investigational drugs under the Right to Try Act, while maintaining
41 appropriate safety protocols and oversight;
42 4. Reschedule psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, ibogaine, mescaline and MDMA to
43 a schedule that better reflects the therapeutic value, low potential for abuse and
44 safety for use under medical supervision of those compounds, giving priority to the
45 rescheduling of compounds that have received Breakthrough Therapy designation
46 from the United States Food and Drug Administration; and
47 5. Establish legal protection against federal prosecution for individuals and
48 entities complying with state and local law concerning the [supervised] adult use of
49 psychedelic compounds and require states to enter research partnerships with the
50 Attorney General under the Controlled Substances Act to study the public health
51 outcomes of such state programs; and be it further
