SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to take certain actions relating
to the therapeutic use of certain psychedelic compounds.
1 WHEREAS, Mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder
2 (PTSD), treatment-resistant depression, anxiety disorders and substance use
3 disorders, affect millions of Americans, including veterans, first responders and
4 other residents of Nevada; and
5 WHEREAS, Conventional treatments for these mental health conditions often
6 prove inadequate for many patients, leaving such patients without effective
7 therapeutic options; and
8 WHEREAS, Preliminary research has indicated that certain psychedelic
9 compounds, including psilocybin, psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT),
10 ibogaine, mescaline and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), when
11 administered in controlled clinical settings, show promising therapeutic potential
12 for treating various mental health conditions; and
13 WHEREAS, The United States Food and Drug Administration has granted, in
14 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, psilocybin
15 therapy for treatment-resistant depression and psilocybin therapy for major
16 depressive disorder Breakthrough Therapy designation, thereby acknowledging the
17 potential of those treatments to offer substantial improvement over existing
18 treatments and expediting their development and review; and
19 WHEREAS, Multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated the
20 safety and efficacy of certain psychedelic-assisted therapy, with trials showing that
21 MDMA-assisted therapy led to 67 percent of patients with severe PTSD no longer
Assembly Amendment No. 555 to
Senate Joint Resolution No. 10 First Reprint Page 4
1 meeting diagnostic criteria after treatment, and psilocybin-assisted therapy
2 demonstrated a 75 percent response rate and a 58 percent remission rate in patients
3 with major depressive disorder at 12 months; and
4 WHEREAS, Researchers at Stanford University demonstrated that ibogaine
5 treatment led to significant improvements in veterans with traumatic brain injury
6 and PTSD, with participants experiencing average reductions of 88 percent in
7 symptoms of PTSD, of 87 percent in symptoms of depression and of 81 percent in
8 symptoms of anxiety at their 1-month follow-up; and
9 WHEREAS, Multiple studies focused on veterans conducted at leading
10 institutions have shown promising results for treating PTSD related to combat and
11 traumatic brain injury with psychedelic compounds, including recent breakthrough
12 findings published in Nature Medicine regarding magnesium-stabilized ibogaine for
13 the treatment of traumatic brain injury; and
14 WHEREAS, Clinical research has demonstrated significant potential for
15 psychedelic compounds to address chronic pain conditions, with studies showing
16 that the pulse administration of psilocybin reduced the frequency of cluster
17 headache attacks by approximately 50 percent from baseline, from an average of
18 18.4 attacks to 9.8 attacks per week, and MDMA-assisted therapy produced
19 significant reductions in the pain intensity, disability and overall pain severity of
20 patients with PTSD with high baseline pain levels; and
21 WHEREAS, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024,
22 Public Law 118-31, directed the Department of Defense to establish a process for
23 service members to participate in clinical trials studying psychedelic compounds,
24 including psilocybin and MDMA, for treating PTSD and traumatic brain injury,
25 allocated $10,000,000 in funding and authorized partnerships with other agencies
26 and academic institutions, thereby demonstrating growing federal recognition of the
27 potential of these treatments; and
28 WHEREAS, The Department of Veterans Affairs has partnered with researchers
29 at Brown University and Yale University to conduct a 5-year study, at the cost of
30 $1,500,000, at the Providence VA Medical Center and West Haven VA Medical
31 Center evaluating MDMA-assisted therapy for veterans with co-occurring PTSD
32 and alcohol use disorder, representing the first research initiative involving
33 psychedelic-assisted therapy funded by the Department since the 1960s, and which
34 was part of a broader effort announced in January 2025 to investigate the safety and
35 efficacy of psychedelic compounds for treating veterans with mental health
36 conditions; and
37 WHEREAS, Extensive research has demonstrated that classic psychedelics have
38 low abuse potential, with studies showing no physical dependence or withdrawal
39 symptoms and clinical evidence indicating that psychedelic compounds can
40 effectively treat substance use disorders; and
41 WHEREAS, Clinical research demonstrates that psychedelic compounds like
42 psilocybin and MDMA have a favorable safety profile when administered in
43 controlled clinical settings with appropriate medical screening and supervision,
44 with studies showing no lasting neuropsychological deficits, organ damage or
45 serious adverse reactions and a significantly lower rate of adverse medical events
46 compared to many current standard treatments; and
47 WHEREAS, Schedule I classification under the Controlled Substances Act, 21
48 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq., designates a substance as having no currently accepted
49 medical use and a high potential for abuse; and
50 WHEREAS, Controlled substances classified in schedule I are subject to
51 significant barriers to research, including more burdensome regulatory and
52 bureaucratic hurdles than research of other controlled substances; and
Assembly Amendment No. 555 to
Senate Joint Resolution No. 10 First Reprint Page 5
1 WHEREAS, Physicians cannot access controlled substances classified in
2 schedule I to treat patients who have terminal or life-threatening conditions under
3 the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right
4 to Try Act of 2017 (“Right to Try Act”), Public Law 115-176, even if the controlled
5 substance is otherwise an eligible investigational drug under the Act; and
6 WHEREAS, The low potential for abuse of psychedelic compounds and
7 evidence of their medical utility, particularly the designation of Breakthrough
8 Therapies by the United States Food and Drug Administration, contradicts their
9 classification as schedule I controlled substances; and
10 WHEREAS, Leading medical research institutions have established dedicated
11 centers for psychedelic research, including the Johns Hopkins Center for
12 Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, the Project on Psychedelics Law and
13 Regulation at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and
14 Bioethics at Harvard Law School, the University of California Berkeley Center for
15 the Science of Psychedelics, the New York University Langone Health’s Center for
16 Psychedelic Medicine, the Parsons Research Center for Psychedelic Healing at the
17 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the Yale Program for Psychedelic
18 Science, the University of Wisconsin-Madison Transdisciplinary Center for
19 Research in Psychoactive Substances, the Stanford Psychedelic Science Group, the
20 Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics, the
21 Charmaine and Gordon McGill Center for Psychedelic Research and Therapy at
22 Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin and the Washington
23 University Program in Psychedelics Research; and
24 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada recognizes the urgent need to address the
25 mental health crisis and expand treatment options for those in need; now, therefore,
26 be it
27 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
28 That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges the Congress of the United States and the
29 appropriate federal agencies to:
30 1. Increase federal funding for research into the therapeutic applications of
31 psychedelic compounds, particularly for treating mental health conditions,
32 substance use disorders and chronic pain;
33 2. Establish a streamlined process for approving and conducting research with
34 psychedelic compounds, while maintaining appropriate safety protocols and
35 oversight;
36 3. Establish a process to allow for compassionate medical use of psychedelic
37 eligible investigational drugs under the Right to Try Act, while maintaining
38 appropriate safety protocols and oversight;
39 4. Reschedule psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, ibogaine, mescaline and MDMA to
40 a schedule that better reflects the therapeutic value, low potential for abuse and
41 safety for use under medical supervision of those compounds, giving priority to the
42 rescheduling of compounds that have received Breakthrough Therapy designation
43 from the United States Food and Drug Administration; and
44 5. Establish legal protection against federal prosecution for individuals and
45 entities complying with state and local law concerning the supervised adult use of
46 psychedelic compounds and require states to enter research partnerships with the
47 Attorney General under the Controlled Substances Act to study the public health
48 outcomes of such state programs; and be it further
49 RESOLVED, That the Nevada Legislature supports expanded research into the
50 therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds at qualified research institutions
