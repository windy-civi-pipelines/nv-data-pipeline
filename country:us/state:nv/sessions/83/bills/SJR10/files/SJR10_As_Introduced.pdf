SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to take certain
actions relating to the therapeutic use of certain
psychedelic compounds.
1 WHEREAS, Mental health conditions, including post-traumatic
2 stress disorder (PTSD), treatment-resistant depression, anxiety
3 disorders and substance use disorders, affect millions of Americans,
4 including veterans, first responders and other residents of Nevada;
5 and
6 WHEREAS, Conventional treatments for these mental health
7 conditions often prove inadequate for many patients, leaving such
8 patients without effective therapeutic options; and
9 WHEREAS, Preliminary research has indicated that certain
10 psychedelic compounds, including psilocybin, psilocin, N,N-
11 dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ibogaine, mescaline and 3,4-
12 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), when administered in
-
*SJR10*

– 2 –
1 controlled clinical settings, show promising therapeutic potential for
2 treating various mental health conditions; and
3 WHEREAS, The United States Food and Drug Administration
4 has granted, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, MDMA-assisted
5 therapy for PTSD, psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant
6 depression and psilocybin therapy for major depressive disorder
7 Breakthrough Therapy designation, thereby acknowledging the
8 potential of those treatments to offer substantial improvement over
9 existing treatments and expediting their development and review;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, Multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials have
12 demonstrated the safety and efficacy of certain psychedelic-assisted
13 therapy, with trials showing that MDMA-assisted therapy led to 67
14 percent of patients with severe PTSD no longer meeting diagnostic
15 criteria after treatment, and psilocybin-assisted therapy led to a 71-
16 percent reduction in depressive symptoms at 1 week post-treatment
17 for patients with treatment-resistant depression, with 58 percent of
18 patients maintaining significant improvement at their 3-month
19 follow-up; and
20 WHEREAS, Researchers at Stanford University demonstrated
21 that ibogaine treatment led to significant improvements in veterans
22 with traumatic brain injury and PTSD, with participants
23 experiencing average reductions of 88 percent in symptoms of
24 PTSD, of 87 percent in symptoms of depression and of 81 percent in
25 symptoms of anxiety at their 1-month follow-up; and
26 WHEREAS, Multiple studies focused on veterans conducted at
27 leading institutions have shown promising results for treating PTSD
28 related to combat and traumatic brain injury with psychedelic
29 compounds, including recent breakthrough findings published in
30 Nature Medicine regarding magnesium-stabilized ibogaine for the
31 treatment of traumatic brain injury; and
32 WHEREAS, Clinical research has demonstrated significant
33 potential for psychedelic compounds to address chronic pain
34 conditions, with studies showing that the pulse administration of
35 psilocybin reduced the frequency of cluster headache attacks by
36 approximately 50 percent from baseline, from an average of 18.4
37 attacks to 9.8 attacks per week, and MDMA-assisted therapy
38 produced significant reductions in the pain intensity, disability and
39 overall pain severity of patients with PTSD with high baseline pain
40 levels; and
41 WHEREAS, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
42 Year 2024, Public Law 118-31, directed the Department of Defense
43 to establish a process for service members to participate in clinical
44 trials studying psychedelic compounds, including psilocybin and
45 MDMA, for treating PTSD and traumatic brain injury, allocated
-

– 3 –
1 $10,000,000 in funding and authorized partnerships with other
2 agencies and academic institutions, thereby demonstrating growing
3 federal recognition of the potential of these treatments; and
4 WHEREAS, The Department of Veterans Affairs has partnered
5 with researchers at Brown University and Yale University to
6 conduct a 5-year study, at the cost of $1,500,000, at the Providence
7 VA Medical Center and West Haven VA Medical Center evaluating
8 MDMA-assisted therapy for veterans with co-occurring PTSD and
9 alcohol use disorder, representing the first research initiative
10 involving psychedelic-assisted therapy funded by the Department
11 since the 1960s, and which was part of a broader effort announced
12 in January 2025 to investigate the safety and efficacy of psychedelic
13 compounds for treating veterans with mental health conditions; and
14 WHEREAS, Extensive research has demonstrated that classic
15 psychedelics have low abuse potential, with studies showing no
16 physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms and clinical evidence
17 indicating that psychedelic compounds can effectively treat
18 substance use disorders; and
19 WHEREAS, Clinical research demonstrates that psychedelic
20 compounds like psilocybin and MDMA have a favorable safety
21 profile when administered in controlled clinical settings with
22 appropriate medical screening and supervision, with studies
23 showing no lasting neuropsychological deficits, organ damage or
24 serious adverse reactions and a significantly lower rate of adverse
25 medical events compared to many current standard treatments; and
26 WHEREAS, Schedule I classification under the Controlled
27 Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq., designates a substance as
28 having no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for
29 abuse; and
30 WHEREAS, Controlled substances classified in schedule I are
31 subject to significant barriers to research, including more
32 burdensome regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles than research of
33 other controlled substances; and
34 WHEREAS, Physicians cannot access controlled substances
35 classified in schedule I to treat patients who have terminal or life-
36 threatening conditions under the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello,
37 Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017
38 (“Right to Try Act”), Public Law 115-176, even if the controlled
39 substance is otherwise an eligible investigational drug under the
40 Act; and
41 WHEREAS, The low potential for abuse of psychedelic
42 compounds and evidence of their medical utility, particularly the
43 designation of Breakthrough Therapies by the United States Food
44 and Drug Administration, contradicts their classification as schedule
45 I controlled substances; and

32 of psychedelic eligible investigational drugs under the Right to Try
33 Act, while maintaining appropriate safety protocols and oversight;
34 4. Reschedule psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, ibogaine, mescaline
35 and MDMA to a schedule that better reflects the therapeutic value,
36 low potential for abuse and safety for use under medical supervision
37 of those compounds, giving priority to the rescheduling of
38 compounds that have received Breakthrough Therapy designation
39 from the United States Food and Drug Administration; and
40 5. Establish legal protection against federal prosecution for
41 individuals and entities complying with state law concerning the
42 supervised adult use of psychedelic compounds and require states to
