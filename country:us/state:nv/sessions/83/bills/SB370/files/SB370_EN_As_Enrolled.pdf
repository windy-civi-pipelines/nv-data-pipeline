AN ACT relating to manufactured housing; revising provisions
governing the issuance of a new certificate of title by the
Housing Division of the Department of Business and
Industry for a manufactured home, mobile home or

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions relating to the
issuance of a certificate of title by the Housing Division of the Department of
Business and Industry for a manufactured home, mobile home, manufactured
building or commercial coach or factory-built housing. (NRS 489.501-489.585)
Under existing law, if a person who is applying for the issuance of a certificate of
ownership for a manufactured home, mobile home or commercial coach from the
Division is unable to present the previously issued certificate of title because it is
unavailable, the Division is authorized to: (1) receive the application, examine the
circumstances of the case and require the filing of affidavits or other information;
and (2) issue a new certificate of title to the applicant when the Division is satisfied
that the applicant is entitled to the certificate. (NRS 489.561) Existing law: (1)
provides an additional procedure for obtaining a certificate of title if the applicant is
unable to provide satisfactory information to the Division that the applicant is
entitled to the certificate, which involves the provision of a bond by the applicant
and an inspection by the Division; and (2) requires the Administrator of the
Division to adopt regulations regarding this procedure. (NRS 489.562, 489.585)
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill require, under either procedure, the Division to either
issue a new certificate of title to an applicant or deny the application within 45 days
after the date on which the requirements for applying for a certificate of title have
been completed. Sections 2 and 3 require the Division to provide an applicant with
written notification of and the reasons for the denial of the application. Section 4 of
this bill requires the Administrator to adopt regulations to establish an expedited
process for the issuance of a new certificate of title by the Division under either
procedure.
Existing law requires the Division to adopt regulations providing for fees for
services provided by the Division. (NRS 489.481) Section 1 of this bill specifically
requires the adoption by regulation of a fee for the expedited process for the
issuance of a certificate of title required to be established in section 4.
