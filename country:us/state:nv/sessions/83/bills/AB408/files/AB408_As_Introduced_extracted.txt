EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to victims of crime; repealing, replacing and
revising certain provisions requiring the notification of
certain victims of crime upon changes in the custody
status of an offender related to release, escape, residential
confinement, clemency and parole; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a statewide automated victim information and
2 notification system known as the Victim Information Notification Everyday System
3 in the Office of the Attorney General. The System consists of a toll-free telephone
4 number and an Internet website through which a victim of crime or member of the
5 public may register to receive certain information concerning a change in the
6 custody status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Existing law also authorizes the State
7 Board of Parole Commissioners to enter into an agreement with the manager of an
8 automated victim notification system that is capable of automatically notifying
9 registered victims by telephone or electronic means of certain information related to
10 a consideration of parole or certain terms of residential confinement. (NRS
11 213.10915) Section 19 of this bill repeals these provisions related to the
12 notification of victims of crime.
13 Instead, section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Corrections to
14 establish an automated victim notification system that is capable of notifying
15 victims of crime by telephone or electronic means of certain information
16 concerning the residential confinement, parole, clemency, escape or release of an
17 offender. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Department to enter into an agreement
18 with a person to manage the automated victim notification system established by
19 section 2, prescribes the manner in which the person may be selected by the
20 Department and requires the agreement to contain certain terms.
21 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to notify a
22 victim of crime by mail of the release or escape of an offender, if the victim
23 provides a current address and requests notification. (NRS 209.521) Section 18
-
*AB408*
– 2 –
24 repeals these provisions related to notice by mail of the release or escape of an
25 offender. Instead, section 2 requires the notice of the release or escape of an
26 offender to be provided by the newly established automated victim notification
27 system to victims of crime who are registered with the system.
28 Existing law provides that if any victim of a crime committed by an offender
29 requests to be notified of certain events concerning the offender, the Division of
30 Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety or the Department of
31 Corrections, as applicable, is required to mail a notice to the victim under certain
32 circumstances related to the residential confinement of the offender and advise the
33 victim that the victim may submit certain documents concerning the matter. (NRS
34 209.392, 209.3923, 209.3925, 209.429) However, existing law provides that if the
35 victim registers with the automated victim notification system utilized by the State
36 Board of Parole Commissioners, such notices related to residential confinement
37 may be provided by the automated victim notification system instead of by mail.
38 (NRS 213.10915) Sections 4-7 of this bill remove the requirement for the Division
39 of Parole and Probation or Department of Corrections, as applicable, to provide
40 such notices related to residential confinement to victims by mail. Instead, section
41 2 requires the newly established automated victim notification system to provide
42 such notices related to residential confinement to victims who are registered with
43 the new system.
44 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Pardons Commissioners to consider
45 applications for clemency. Existing law requires the Board to provide notice by
46 mail of a meeting to consider an application for clemency to each victim of a crime
47 committed by the applicant for clemency. (NRS 213.010) Section 8 of this bill
48 removes the requirement for the Board to mail notice of the meeting. Instead,
49 section 2 requires the notice to be provided by the newly established automated
50 victim notification system. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change related
51 to the provision of notice related to clemency by the newly established automated
52 victim notification system.
53 Existing law requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to mail a notice
54 to a victim of crime concerning the date of a parole hearing of a prisoner and the
55 right of the victim to testify at the hearing, if the victim has requested notification
56 and provided a mailing address to the Board. (NRS 213.131) However, existing law
57 provides that if the victim registers with the automated victim notification system
58 utilized by the Board, such notices related to parole are provided by the automated
59 victim notification system instead of by mail. (NRS 213.10915) Section 14 of this
60 bill removes the requirement for the Board to provide the notices related to a parole
61 hearing by mail. Instead, section 2 requires the newly established automated victim
62 notification system to provide such notices related to parole to victims of crime
63 who are registered with the new system. Sections 11-13 and 15 of this bill make
64 conforming changes related to the provision of notices related to parole through the
65 newly established automatic victim notification system. Section 10 of this bill
66 defines the term “automated victim notification system” for the purposes of
67 sections 11-15.
68 Sections 16 and 17 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect: (1) the
69 removal or repeal of the provisions concerning notice by mail in sections 4-8, 14
70 and 18; and (2) the provision of notice through the newly established automated
71 victim notification system under section 2.

A.B. 408
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 408–ASSEMBLYMEMBER YUREK
MARCH 12, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to victims of crime.
(BDR 16-587)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to victims of crime; repealing, replacing and
revising certain provisions requiring the notification of
certain victims of crime upon changes in the custody
status of an offender related to release, escape, residential
confinement, clemency and parole; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a statewide automated victim information and
2 notification system known as the Victim Information Notification Everyday System
3 in the Office of the Attorney General. The System consists of a toll-free telephone
4 number and an Internet website through which a victim of crime or member of the
5 public may register to receive certain information concerning a change in the
6 custody status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Existing law also authorizes the State
7 Board of Parole Commissioners to enter into an agreement with the manager of an
8 automated victim notification system that is capable of automatically notifying
9 registered victims by telephone or electronic means of certain information related to
10 a consideration of parole or certain terms of residential confinement. (NRS
11 213.10915) Section 19 of this bill repeals these provisions related to the
12 notification of victims of crime.
13 Instead, section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Corrections to
14 establish an automated victim notification system that is capable of notifying
15 victims of crime by telephone or electronic means of certain information
16 concerning the residential confinement, parole, clemency, escape or release of an
17 offender. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Department to enter into an agreement
18 with a person to manage the automated victim notification system established by
19 section 2, prescribes the manner in which the person may be selected by the
20 Department and requires the agreement to contain certain terms.
21 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to notify a
22 victim of crime by mail of the release or escape of an offender, if the victim
23 provides a current address and requests notification. (NRS 209.521) Section 18
-
*AB408*

– 2 –
24 repeals these provisions related to notice by mail of the release or escape of an
25 offender. Instead, section 2 requires the notice of the release or escape of an
26 offender to be provided by the newly established automated victim notification
27 system to victims of crime who are registered with the system.
28 Existing law provides that if any victim of a crime committed by an offender
29 requests to be notified of certain events concerning the offender, the Division of
30 Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety or the Department of
31 Corrections, as applicable, is required to mail a notice to the victim under certain
32 circumstances related to the residential confinement of the offender and advise the
33 victim that the victim may submit certain documents concerning the matter. (NRS
34 209.392, 209.3923, 209.3925, 209.429) However, existing law provides that if the
35 victim registers with the automated victim notification system utilized by the State
36 Board of Parole Commissioners, such notices related to residential confinement
37 may be provided by the automated victim notification system instead of by mail.
38 (NRS 213.10915) Sections 4-7 of this bill remove the requirement for the Division
39 of Parole and Probation or Department of Corrections, as applicable, to provide
40 such notices related to residential confinement to victims by mail. Instead, section
41 2 requires the newly established automated victim notification system to provide
42 such notices related to residential confinement to victims who are registered with
43 the new system.
44 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Pardons Commissioners to consider
45 applications for clemency. Existing law requires the Board to provide notice by
46 mail of a meeting to consider an application for clemency to each victim of a crime
47 committed by the applicant for clemency. (NRS 213.010) Section 8 of this bill
48 removes the requirement for the Board to mail notice of the meeting. Instead,
49 section 2 requires the notice to be provided by the newly established automated
50 victim notification system. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change related
51 to the provision of notice related to clemency by the newly established automated
52 victim notification system.
53 Existing law requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to mail a notice
54 to a victim of crime concerning the date of a parole hearing of a prisoner and the
55 right of the victim to testify at the hearing, if the victim has requested notification
56 and provided a mailing address to the Board. (NRS 213.131) However, existing law
57 provides that if the victim registers with the automated victim notification system
58 utilized by the Board, such notices related to parole are provided by the automated
59 victim notification system instead of by mail. (NRS 213.10915) Section 14 of this
60 bill removes the requirement for the Board to provide the notices related to a parole
61 hearing by mail. Instead, section 2 requires the newly established automated victim
62 notification system to provide such notices related to parole to victims of crime
63 who are registered with the new system. Sections 11-13 and 15 of this bill make
64 conforming changes related to the provision of notices related to parole through the
65 newly established automatic victim notification system. Section 10 of this bill
66 defines the term “automated victim notification system” for the purposes of
67 sections 11-15.
68 Sections 16 and 17 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect: (1) the
69 removal or repeal of the provisions concerning notice by mail in sections 4-8, 14
70 and 18; and (2) the provision of notice through the newly established automated
71 victim notification system under section 2.

39 provide the prisoner with an opportunity to be present and
40 determines that it may deny parole, the Board may reschedule the
41 meeting.
42 [10.] 8. During a meeting to consider a prisoner for parole, the
43 Board shall allow the prisoner:
44 (a) At his or her own expense, to have a representative present
