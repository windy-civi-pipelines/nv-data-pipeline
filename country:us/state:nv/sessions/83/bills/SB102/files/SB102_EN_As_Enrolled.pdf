duties of presidential electors. (NRS 298.005-298.089) Section 3 of this bill
prohibits a person from creating or serving in a false slate of presidential electors or
conspiring to create or serve in a false slate of presidential electors. Section 3
further: (1) provides that a person is guilty of a category D felony for committing
such an offense; (2) provides that such a person shall be punished by imprisonment
in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term
of not more than 4 years; (3) authorizes a court to order a person convicted of such
an offense to pay a fine of not more than $5,000 and repay the costs of investigation
and prosecution incurred by the Secretary of State or the Attorney General, as
applicable; and (4) provides that if the court grants probation to a person convicted
of such an offense, the court must require, as a condition of probation, that the
person serve at least 6 months in the county jail.
Section 3 authorizes a person who believes that such an alleged violation has
occurred to notify the Secretary of State in writing on a form prescribed by the
Secretary of State. Section 3 requires the Secretary of State to investigate an
alleged violation or refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General or a district

person convicted of a crime set forth in section 3 from obtaining the restoration of
the civil right to hold office.
Existing law sets forth the process, for each major and minor political party as
well as each independent candidate, for the selection of a nominee to the position of

elector required by law. (NRS 298.035) Existing law further provides that the
