AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions relating to
certain categorical grants to fund the adoption assistance program;
providing for a study of and the development of a plan for
reinvesting certain money; making appropriations; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings realized from
2 expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, known as
3 “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the state’s child welfare system. (42
4 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency
6 which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
7 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance
8 program. Existing law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on
9 the estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program. (NRS
10 432B.219) [This bill requires the Division to additionally base the amount of such a
11 categorical grant on the adoption savings calculated for the immediately preceding fiscal year
12 pursuant to federal law.]
13 Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that has not been
14 used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the fiscal year reverts to the
15 State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law provides that the portion of such
16 money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is identified as adoption savings does not
17 revert until the end of the immediately following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the
18 agency which provides child welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that
19 money for any costs of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal
20 year. (NRS 432B.219) [This] Section 1 of this bill [authorizes] instead provides that money
21 awarded through such a categorical grant never reverts to the State General Fund,
22 regardless of whether the money is identified as adoption savings. Additionally, section 1
23 requires an agency which provides child welfare services to continue to use such money for
24 [any such] the costs of providing child welfare services. If the money is identified as

Assembly Amendment No. 853 to Assembly Bill No. 515 First Reprint Page 4
25 adoption savings, section 1 requires the money to be used in a manner consistent with
26 federal law . [for an additional fiscal year before the money reverts to the State General Fund.]
27 Section 2 of this bill defines “Division” for the purposes of sections 3, 4 and 5 of this bill
28 to refer to the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
29 Human Services. Sections 3 and 4 appropriate to the Division certain unexpended
30 adoption savings for expenditure in accordance with federal law to provide child welfare
31 services. Section 5 requires the Division and other agencies which provide child welfare
32 services in this State to study and develop a plan for reinvesting unexpended adoption
33 savings.
