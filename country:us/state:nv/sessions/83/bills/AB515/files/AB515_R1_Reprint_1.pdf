AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions
relating to certain categorical grants to fund the adoption
assistance program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings
2 realized from expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social
3 Security Act, known as “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the
4 state’s child welfare system. (42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the
5 Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
6 Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency which provides child welfare
7 services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and
8 Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance program. Existing
9 law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on the
10 estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program. (NRS
11 432B.219) This bill requires the Division to additionally base the amount of such a
12 categorical grant on the adoption savings calculated for the immediately preceding
13 fiscal year pursuant to federal law.
14 Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that
15 has not been used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the
16 fiscal year reverts to the State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law
17 provides that the portion of such money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is
18 identified as adoption savings does not revert until the end of the immediately
19 following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the agency which provides child
20 welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that money for any costs

21 of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal year. (NRS
22 432B.219) This bill authorizes an agency which provides child welfare services to
23 continue to use such money for any such costs in a manner consistent with federal
24 law for an additional fiscal year before the money reverts to the State General Fund.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 432B.219 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 432B.219 1. The Division of Child and Family Services shall
4 provide a categorical grant to each agency which provides child
5 welfare services for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance
6 program to the extent that money has been appropriated to the
7 Division for that purpose. The amount of the grant must be based
8 upon [the] :
9 (a) The estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption
10 assistance program [.] ; and
11 (b) The amount identified as savings pursuant to the
12 calculation required under 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(A), reported at
13 the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year.
14 2. The amount of the grant awarded pursuant to subsection 1
15 must be determined for 2 years beginning on July 1 of each odd-
16 numbered year and allocated each fiscal year.
17 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4:
18 (a) An agency which provides child welfare services that
19 receives a grant pursuant to subsection 1 must use the money
20 allocated only for costs associated with the adoption assistance
21 program.
22 (b) Any money from the grant awarded pursuant to subsection 1
23 that has not been used or committed for expenditure by the agency
24 which provides child welfare services by the end of the fiscal year
25 reverts to the State General Fund.
26 4. The portion of any money remaining at the end of a fiscal
27 year from a grant awarded pursuant to subsection 1 that is identified
28 as savings pursuant to the calculation required under 42 U.S.C. §
29 [673(a)(8)(D)(ii)] 673(a)(8)(A) does not revert to the State General
30 Fund and may be carried forward to the next 2 fiscal [year] years
31 and used for any costs of providing child welfare services [without
32 restriction.] in a manner that is consistent with the requirements
33 and restrictions set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D). Any such
34 money identified as savings that has not been used or committed for
35 expenditure by the agency which provides child welfare services by
36 the end of the second fiscal year to which the money was carried
37 forward reverts to the State General Fund.
