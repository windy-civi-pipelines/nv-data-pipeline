AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions relating to
certain categorical grants to fund the adoption assistance program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings realized from
2 expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, known as
3 “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the state’s child welfare system. (42
4 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency
6 which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
7 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance
8 program. Existing law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on
9 the estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program. (NRS
10 432B.219) This bill requires the Division to additionally base the amount of such a categorical
11 grant on the adoption savings calculated for the immediately preceding fiscal year pursuant to
12 federal law.
13 Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that has not been
14 used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the fiscal year reverts to the
15 State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law provides that the portion of such
16 money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is identified as adoption savings does not
17 revert until the end of the immediately following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the
18 agency which provides child welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that
19 money for any costs of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal
20 year. (NRS 432B.219) This bill authorizes an agency which provides child welfare services to
21 continue to use such money for any such costs in a manner consistent with federal law for
22 an additional fiscal year before the money reverts to the State General Fund.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 432B.219 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 432B.219 1. The Division of Child and Family Services shall provide a
3 categorical grant to each agency which provides child welfare services for each
4 fiscal year for its adoption assistance program to the extent that money has been
5 appropriated to the Division for that purpose. The amount of the grant must be
6 based upon [the] :
7 (a) The estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance
8 program [.] ; and
9 (b) The amount identified as savings pursuant to the calculation required
10 under 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(A), reported at the end of the immediately preceding
11 fiscal year.
12 2. The amount of the grant awarded pursuant to subsection 1 must be
13 determined for 2 years beginning on July 1 of each odd-numbered year and
14 allocated each fiscal year.
15 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4:
16 (a) An agency which provides child welfare services that receives a grant
17 pursuant to subsection 1 must use the money allocated only for costs associated
18 with the adoption assistance program.
19 (b) Any money from the grant awarded pursuant to subsection 1 that has not
20 been used or committed for expenditure by the agency which provides child welfare
21 services by the end of the fiscal year reverts to the State General Fund.
22 4. The portion of any money remaining at the end of a fiscal year from a grant
23 awarded pursuant to subsection 1 that is identified as savings pursuant to the
24 calculation required under 42 U.S.C. § [673(a)(8)(D)(ii)] 673(a)(8)(A) does not
25 revert to the State General Fund and may be carried forward to the next 2 fiscal
26 [year] years and used for any costs of providing child welfare services [without
27 restriction.] in a manner that is consistent with the requirements and restrictions
28 set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D). Any such money identified as savings that
29 has not been used or committed for expenditure by the agency which provides child
30 welfare services by the end of the second fiscal year to which the money was
31 carried forward reverts to the State General Fund.
32 Sec. 2. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
