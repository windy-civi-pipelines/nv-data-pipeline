Section 1:
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions
relating to certain categorical grants to fund the adoption
assistance program; providing for a study of and the
development of a plan for reinvesting certain money; making
appropriations; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings
realized from expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social
Security Act, known as “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the
state’s child welfare system. (42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the
Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency which provides child welfare
services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and
Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance program. Existing
law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on the
estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program.
(NRS 432B.219)
Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that
has not been used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the
fiscal year reverts to the State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law
provides that the portion of such money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is
identified as adoption savings does not revert until the end of the immediately
following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the agency which provides child
welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that money for any costs
of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal year. (NRS
432B.219) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that money awarded through such
a categorical grant never reverts to the State General Fund, regardless of whether
the money is identified as adoption savings. Additionally, section 1 requires an
agency which provides child welfare services to continue to use such money for the
costs of providing child welfare services in a manner consistent with the
requirements and restrictions imposed by federal law. Section 2 of this bill defines
“Division” for the purposes of sections 3, 4 and 5 of this bill to refer to the
Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
Services. Sections 3 and 4 appropriate to the Division certain unexpended adoption
savings for expenditure in accordance with federal law to provide child welfare
services. Section 5 requires the Division and other agencies which provide child
welfare services in this State to study and develop a plan for reinvesting
unexpended adoption savings.
