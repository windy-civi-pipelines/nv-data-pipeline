EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions relating to
certain categorical grants to fund the adoption assistance program;
providing for a study of and the development of a plan for reinvesting
certain money; making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings realized from
2 expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, known as
3 “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the state’s child welfare system. (42
4 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency
6 which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
7 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance
8 program. Existing law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on
9 the estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program. (NRS
10 432B.219)
11 Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that has not been
12 used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the fiscal year reverts to the
13 State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law provides that the portion of such
14 money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is identified as adoption savings does not
15 revert until the end of the immediately following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the
16 agency which provides child welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that
17 money for any costs of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal
18 year. (NRS 432B.219) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that money awarded through
19 such a categorical grant never reverts to the State General Fund, regardless of whether the
20 money is identified as adoption savings. Additionally, section 1 requires an agency which
21 provides child welfare services to continue to use such money for the costs of providing child
22 welfare services [. If the money is identified as adoption savings, section 1 requires the money
23 to be used] in a manner consistent with the requirements and restrictions imposed by
24 federal law. Section 2 of this bill defines “Division” for the purposes of sections 3, 4 and 5 of
Senate Amendment No. 985 to Assembly Bill No. 515 Second Reprint Page 4
25 this bill to refer to the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
26 Human Services. Sections 3 and 4 appropriate to the Division certain unexpended adoption
27 savings for expenditure in accordance with federal law to provide child welfare services.
28 Section 5 requires the Division and other agencies which provide child welfare services in this
29 State to study and develop a plan for reinvesting unexpended adoption savings.

AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions relating to
certain categorical grants to fund the adoption assistance program;
providing for a study of and the development of a plan for reinvesting
certain money; making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings realized from
2 expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, known as
3 “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the state’s child welfare system. (42
4 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency
6 which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
7 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance
8 program. Existing law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on
9 the estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program. (NRS
10 432B.219)
11 Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that has not been
12 used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the fiscal year reverts to the
13 State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law provides that the portion of such
14 money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is identified as adoption savings does not
15 revert until the end of the immediately following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the
16 agency which provides child welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that
17 money for any costs of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal
18 year. (NRS 432B.219) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that money awarded through
19 such a categorical grant never reverts to the State General Fund, regardless of whether the
20 money is identified as adoption savings. Additionally, section 1 requires an agency which
21 provides child welfare services to continue to use such money for the costs of providing child
22 welfare services [. If the money is identified as adoption savings, section 1 requires the money
23 to be used] in a manner consistent with the requirements and restrictions imposed by
24 federal law. Section 2 of this bill defines “Division” for the purposes of sections 3, 4 and 5 of

Senate Amendment No. 985 to Assembly Bill No. 515 Second Reprint Page 4
25 this bill to refer to the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and
26 Human Services. Sections 3 and 4 appropriate to the Division certain unexpended adoption
27 savings for expenditure in accordance with federal law to provide child welfare services.
28 Section 5 requires the Division and other agencies which provide child welfare services in this
29 State to study and develop a plan for reinvesting unexpended adoption savings.
