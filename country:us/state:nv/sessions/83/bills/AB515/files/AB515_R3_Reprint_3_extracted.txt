SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to adoption assistance
programs. (BDR 38-355)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the protection of children; revising provisions
relating to certain categorical grants to fund the adoption
assistance program; providing for a study of and the
development of a plan for reinvesting certain money;
making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires each child welfare agency to calculate savings
2 realized from expanded eligibility for children under Title IV-E of the Social
3 Security Act, known as “adoption savings,” and reinvest an equal amount in the
4 state’s child welfare system. (42 U.S.C. § 673(a)(8)(D)) Existing law requires the
5 Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
6 Services to provide a categorical grant to each agency which provides child welfare
7 services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and
8 Washoe Counties) for each fiscal year for its adoption assistance program. Existing
9 law requires the Division to base the amount of such a categorical grant on the
10 estimated cost of the projected growth in the adoption assistance program.
11 (NRS 432B.219)
12 Under existing law, any money remaining from such a categorical grant that
13 has not been used or committed for expenditure by the agency by the end of the
14 fiscal year reverts to the State General Fund in most cases. However, existing law
15 provides that the portion of such money remaining at the end of a fiscal year that is
16 identified as adoption savings does not revert until the end of the immediately
17 following fiscal year. Existing law authorizes the agency which provides child
18 welfare services that received the categorical grant to use that money for any costs
-
*AB515_R3*
– 2 –
19 of providing child welfare services without restriction during that fiscal year. (NRS
20 432B.219) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that money awarded through such
21 a categorical grant never reverts to the State General Fund, regardless of whether
22 the money is identified as adoption savings. Additionally, section 1 requires an
23 agency which provides child welfare services to continue to use such money for the
24 costs of providing child welfare services in a manner consistent with the
25 requirements and restrictions imposed by federal law. Section 2 of this bill defines
26 “Division” for the purposes of sections 3, 4 and 5 of this bill to refer to the
27 Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
28 Services. Sections 3 and 4 appropriate to the Division certain unexpended adoption
29 savings for expenditure in accordance with federal law to provide child welfare
30 services. Section 5 requires the Division and other agencies which provide child
31 welfare services in this State to study and develop a plan for reinvesting
32 unexpended adoption savings.
