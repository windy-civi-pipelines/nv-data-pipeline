AN ACT relating to business associations; reducing fees related to
creating and dissolving limited-liability companies under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes one or more persons to form and conduct business as a
2 limited-liability company by: (1) filing articles of organization with the Secretary of
3 State and paying a filing fee of $75; (2) filing an initial list containing certain
4 information about the limited-liability company with the Secretary of State and
5 paying a filing fee of $150; and (3) obtaining a state business license from the
6 Secretary of State and paying a fee of $200 for the issuance of the license. (NRS
7 76.100, 86.151, 86.263, 86.561) Sections 1-3 of this bill reduce these fees to $25,
8 respectively, if the articles of organization of the limited-liability company include
9 an initial manager or member who has received unemployment compensation
10 within the 7 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of the articles of
11 organization.
12 Additionally, existing law authorizes a limited-liability company to dissolve
13 under certain circumstances and imposes a fee of $100 for the filing of the articles
14 of dissolution with the Secretary of State. (NRS 86.4895-86.541, 86.561) Section 3
15 reduces the fee to $25.

24 in which the anniversary date of the alternative due date occurs in
25 each year, file with the Secretary of State, on a form furnished by
26 the Secretary of State, an annual list containing all of the

31 provisions of chapter 76 of NRS;
32 (b) The limited-liability company acknowledges that pursuant to

*AB373*

– 5 –
1 within the 7 days immediately preceding the date of the filing of
2 the articles of organization, a fee of $25.
3 (b) Each annual list required by subsection 2, the limited-
4 liability company shall pay to the Secretary of State a fee of $150.
5 5. If a limited-liability company files an amended list of

8 1 is filed, the limited-liability company or the resigning manager or
9 managing member is not required to pay a fee for filing the
10 amended list.
11 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, if a manager

25 1 or 2 is defective or the fee required by subsection 4 is not paid, the
26 Secretary of State may return the list for correction or payment.

29 date shall be deemed an amended list for the previous year.

32 managing member with the fraudulent intent of concealing the
33 identity of any person or persons exercising the power or authority
34 of a manager or managing member in furtherance of any unlawful
35 conduct is subject to the penalty set forth in NRS 225.084.
36 11. For the purposes of this section, a member is not deemed to
37 exercise actual control of the daily operations of a limited-liability

41 company to select an alternative due date for filing the list required
42 by subsection 1.
