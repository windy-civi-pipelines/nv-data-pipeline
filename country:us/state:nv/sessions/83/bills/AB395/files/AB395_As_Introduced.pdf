EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health facilities
and providers of health care to provide qualified sign
language interpreters to certain persons who are deaf or
hard of hearing; prescribing the circumstances under
which such qualified sign language interpreters may be
provided remotely; establishing requirements for
providing remotely such qualified sign language
interpreters; requiring the Department of Health and
Human Services to maintain a list of certain facilities that
provide services specialized to persons who are deaf or
hard of hearing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require providers of health care and health care
2 facilities that receive funding or certain other assistance from the Federal
3 Government to ensure that communications with persons with disabilities are as
4 effective as communications with persons who do not have disabilities. (45 C.F.R.
5 § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1) prohibit such providers and facilities from
6 requiring a person with a disability to be accompanied by a person to interpret for
7 him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and facilities to provide qualified
8 interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45
9 C.F.R. § 92.202)
10 Sections 1 and 8 of this bill require a medical facility, a facility for the
11 dependent and certain other health facilities and a provider of health care,
-

12 respectively, to ensure that each person who is deaf or hard of hearing and seeks
13 care or services at the facility or from the provider, as applicable, is notified that:
14 (1) a qualified sign language interpreter is available; and (2) except in certain
15 circumstances, the person may request an in-person or remote sign language
16 interpreter. Sections 1 and 8 require such a health facility or provider of health care
17 to ensure that such a person is provided with a qualified sign language interpreter in
18 person if: (1) the person requests an in-person interpreter; or (2) certain
19 circumstances exist that would make a remote interpreter inappropriate, unless a
20 person provides informed consent to receive sign language interpreting services
21 from a remote interpreter. Sections 1 and 8 prescribe requirements governing the
22 use of a remote interpreter.
23 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to establish the
24 applicability of certain existing provisions to section 1. Sections 4-6 and 9 of this
25 bill prescribe various mechanisms for the enforcement of section 1, including the
26 imposition of administrative sanctions against a health facility that fails to comply
27 with those provisions. Section 8 authorizes professional discipline against a
28 provider of health care who fails to comply with that section.
29 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
30 maintain on an Internet website a list of assisted living facilities and senior living
31 communities that provide services specialized for persons who are deaf or hard of
32 hearing.
