EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health facilities
and providers of health care to provide qualified sign
language interpreters to certain persons who are deaf or
hard of hearing; prescribing the circumstances under
which such qualified sign language interpreters may be
provided remotely; establishing requirements for
providing remotely such qualified sign language
interpreters; requiring the Department of Health and
Human Services to maintain a list of certain facilities that
provide services specialized to persons who are deaf or
hard of hearing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require providers of health care and health care
2 facilities that receive funding or certain other assistance from the Federal
3 Government to ensure that communications with persons with disabilities are as
4 effective as communications with persons who do not have disabilities. (45 C.F.R.
5 § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1) prohibit such providers and facilities from
6 requiring a person with a disability to be accompanied by a person to interpret for
7 him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and facilities to provide qualified
8 interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45
9 C.F.R. § 92.202)
10 Sections 1 and 8 of this bill require a medical facility, a facility for the
11 dependent and certain other health facilities in a county whose population is 20,000
-
*AB395_R1*
– 2 –
12 or more (currently Clark, Washoe, Lyon, Elko, Nye, Douglas and Churchill
13 Counties and Carson City) and a provider of health care who is providing services
14 in such a county, respectively, to ensure that each person who is deaf or hard of
15 hearing and seeks care or services at the facility or from the provider, as applicable,
16 is notified: (1) that a qualified sign language interpreter can be made available; (2)
17 that the person may request an in-person or remote sign language interpreter; and
18 (3) of any other accommodations that may be made available. If the person requests
19 an in-person qualified sign language interpreter, sections 1 and 8 require such a
20 health facility or provider of health care to: (1) provide the person with a qualified
21 sign language interpreter in person if the request is made at least 48 hours before a
22 prescheduled encounter or at least 2 hours after arriving at the health facility for an
23 unplanned inpatient hospitalization; or (2) make a good faith effort to provide the
24 person with a qualified sign language interpreter in person under all other
25 circumstances. If the health facility or provider of health care cannot provide an in-
26 person qualified sign language interpreter after making a good faith effort or if the
27 person requests a remote interpreter, sections 1 and 8 require the health facility or
28 provider of health care to provide a remote interpreter. Sections 1 and 8 prescribe
29 requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter.
30 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to establish the
31 applicability of certain existing provisions to section 1. Sections 4-6 and 9 of this
32 bill prescribe various mechanisms for the enforcement of section 1, including the
33 imposition of administrative sanctions against a health facility that fails to comply
34 with those provisions. Section 8 authorizes professional discipline against a
35 provider of health care who fails to comply with that section.
36 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
37 maintain on an Internet website a list of assisted living facilities and senior living
38 communities that provide services specialized for persons who are deaf or hard of
39 hearing.

MARCH 11, 2025

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to services to persons
who are deaf or hard of hearing. (BDR 40-841)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health facilities
and providers of health care to provide qualified sign
language interpreters to certain persons who are deaf or
hard of hearing; prescribing the circumstances under
which such qualified sign language interpreters may be
provided remotely; establishing requirements for
providing remotely such qualified sign language
interpreters; requiring the Department of Health and
Human Services to maintain a list of certain facilities that
provide services specialized to persons who are deaf or
hard of hearing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require providers of health care and health care
2 facilities that receive funding or certain other assistance from the Federal
3 Government to ensure that communications with persons with disabilities are as
4 effective as communications with persons who do not have disabilities. (45 C.F.R.
5 § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1) prohibit such providers and facilities from
6 requiring a person with a disability to be accompanied by a person to interpret for
7 him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and facilities to provide qualified
8 interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45
9 C.F.R. § 92.202)
10 Sections 1 and 8 of this bill require a medical facility, a facility for the
11 dependent and certain other health facilities in a county whose population is 20,000
-
*AB395_R1*

– 2 –
12 or more (currently Clark, Washoe, Lyon, Elko, Nye, Douglas and Churchill
13 Counties and Carson City) and a provider of health care who is providing services
14 in such a county, respectively, to ensure that each person who is deaf or hard of
15 hearing and seeks care or services at the facility or from the provider, as applicable,
16 is notified: (1) that a qualified sign language interpreter can be made available; (2)
17 that the person may request an in-person or remote sign language interpreter; and
18 (3) of any other accommodations that may be made available. If the person requests
19 an in-person qualified sign language interpreter, sections 1 and 8 require such a
20 health facility or provider of health care to: (1) provide the person with a qualified
21 sign language interpreter in person if the request is made at least 48 hours before a
22 prescheduled encounter or at least 2 hours after arriving at the health facility for an
23 unplanned inpatient hospitalization; or (2) make a good faith effort to provide the
24 person with a qualified sign language interpreter in person under all other
25 circumstances. If the health facility or provider of health care cannot provide an in-
26 person qualified sign language interpreter after making a good faith effort or if the
27 person requests a remote interpreter, sections 1 and 8 require the health facility or
28 provider of health care to provide a remote interpreter. Sections 1 and 8 prescribe
29 requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter.
30 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to establish the
31 applicability of certain existing provisions to section 1. Sections 4-6 and 9 of this
32 bill prescribe various mechanisms for the enforcement of section 1, including the
33 imposition of administrative sanctions against a health facility that fails to comply
34 with those provisions. Section 8 authorizes professional discipline against a
35 provider of health care who fails to comply with that section.
36 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
37 maintain on an Internet website a list of assisted living facilities and senior living
38 communities that provide services specialized for persons who are deaf or hard of
39 hearing.
