EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health facilities and providers of
health care to provide qualified sign language interpreters to certain
persons who are deaf or hard of hearing; prescribing the circumstances
under which such qualified sign language interpreters may be provided
remotely; establishing requirements for providing remotely such
qualified sign language interpreters; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to maintain a list of certain facilities that
provide services specialized to persons who are deaf or hard of
hearing; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations require providers of health care and health care facilities that
2 receive funding or certain other assistance from the Federal Government to ensure that
3 communications with persons with disabilities are as effective as communications with
4 persons who do not have disabilities. (45 C.F.R. § 92.202) Those federal regulations: (1)
5 prohibit such providers and facilities from requiring a person with a disability to be
6 accompanied by a person to interpret for him or her; and (2) authorize such providers and
7 facilities to provide qualified interpreters through video remote interpreting services. (28
8 C.F.R. § 35.160, 45 C.F.R. § 92.202)
9 Sections 1 and 8 of this bill require a medical facility, a facility for the dependent and
10 certain other health facilities in a county whose population is 20,000 or more (currently
11 Clark, Washoe, Lyon, Elko, Nye, Douglas and Churchill Counties and Carson City) and
12 a provider of health care [,] who is providing services in such a county, respectively, to
13 ensure that each person who is deaf or hard of hearing and seeks care or services at the facility
14 or from the provider, as applicable, is notified : [that:] (1) that a qualified sign language
15 interpreter [is] can be made available; [and] (2) [except in certain circumstances,] that the
16 person may request an in-person or remote sign language interpreter [. Sections] ; and (3) of
17 any other accommodations that may be made available. If the person requests an in-
18 person qualified sign language interpreter, sections 1 and 8 require such a health facility or
19 provider of health care to [ensure that such a] : (1) provide the person [is provided] with a

Assembly Amendment No. 455 to Assembly Bill No. 395 Page 4
20 qualified sign language interpreter in person if [: (1) the person requests an in-person
21 interpreter;] the request is made at least 48 hours before a prescheduled encounter or at
22 least 2 hours after arriving at the health facility for an unplanned inpatient
23 hospitalization; or (2) [certain circumstances exist that would make a remote interpreter
24 inappropriate, unless a person provides informed consent to receive sign language interpreting
25 services from] make a good faith effort to provide the person with a qualified sign
26 language interpreter in person under all other circumstances. If the health facility or
27 provider of health care cannot provide an in-person qualified sign language interpreter
28 after making a good faith effort or if the person requests a remote interpreter, sections 1
29 and 8 require the health facility or provider of health care to provide a remote interpreter.
30 Sections 1 and 8 prescribe requirements governing the use of a remote interpreter.
31 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to establish the applicability of
32 certain existing provisions to section 1. Sections 4-6 and 9 of this bill prescribe various
33 mechanisms for the enforcement of section 1, including the imposition of administrative
34 sanctions against a health facility that fails to comply with those provisions. Section 8
35 authorizes professional discipline against a provider of health care who fails to comply with
36 that section.
37 Section 7 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to maintain
38 on an Internet website a list of assisted living facilities and senior living communities that
39 provide services specialized for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.
