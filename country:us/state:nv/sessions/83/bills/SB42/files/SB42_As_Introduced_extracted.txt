AN ACT relating to state financial administration; removing

3 proposed budget to include: (1) an identification of each long-term performance
4 goal of the Executive Department for core governmental functions and other

6 next 2 fiscal years toward achieving those goals; and (3) an explanation of the
7 means by which the proposed budget will provide adequate funding for those

11 objectives and long-term performance goals each department, institution or other
12 agency of the Executive Department is tasked with achieving and the measurement
13 indicators that will be used to determine whether the department, institution or
14 other agency is successful in achieving those objectives and goals. (NRS 353.205)

15 Section 1 of this bill eliminates the requirement for each proposed budget to
16 include: (1) an explanation of the means by which the proposed budget will provide
17 adequate funding for core government functions and other governmental services
18 such that the intermediate objectives will be met and progress will be made toward
19 achieving the long-term performance goals for such functions and services; and (2)
20 the mission statement articulating the intermediate objectives and long-term
21 performance goals of each department, institution or other agency and the
22 measurement indicators for measuring the success of each department, institution or
23 other agency in achieving those objectives and goals.
24 Section 1 eliminates the requirement for the Budget Division of the Office of
25 Finance in the Office of the Governor to post on its Internet website, as soon as
26 practicable after the Governor transmits the proposed budget to the Legislature: (1)
27 the information required to be included in the proposed budget regarding the
28 identification of the long-term performance goals of the Executive Department for
29 core governmental functions and other governmental services and the intermediate
30 objectives toward achieving those goals for the next 2 fiscal years; and (2) certain
31 additional information which section 1 eliminates from inclusion in the proposed
32 budget.
33 Existing law requires the Chief of the Division to require the Office of
34 Economic Development and the Office of Energy to each periodically conduct an
35 analysis of the costs and benefits of each incentive for economic development
36 previously approved by the respective office and in effect during the immediately
37 preceding 2 fiscal years and to report the result of the analysis to the Chief. (NRS
38 353.207) Existing law requires the result of each such analysis to be included in the
39 proposed budget for the Executive Department. (NRS 353.205) Section 2 of this
40 bill maintains the requirement to conduct and report this analysis but eliminates the
41 requirement for the Chief to establish a schedule for performing and reporting
42 the results of the analyses to ensure that the results of the analyses are included in
43 the proposed budget.
44 On or before September 1 of each even-numbered year, existing law requires
45 the departments, institutions and other agencies of the Executive Department to
46 submit to the Chief estimates of the expenditure requirements of the department,
47 institution or agency for the next 2 fiscal years, together with all anticipated income
48 from fees and other sources. (NRS 353.210) Section 3 of this bill makes a
49 conforming change by removing the requirement for these estimates to include a
50 mission statement and measurement indicators in adequate detail to comply with
51 certain provisions regarding the contents of the proposed budget removed by
52 section 1.

15 Section 1 of this bill eliminates the requirement for each proposed budget to
16 include: (1) an explanation of the means by which the proposed budget will provide
17 adequate funding for core government functions and other governmental services
18 such that the intermediate objectives will be met and progress will be made toward
19 achieving the long-term performance goals for such functions and services; and (2)
20 the mission statement articulating the intermediate objectives and long-term
21 performance goals of each department, institution or other agency and the

24 Section 1 eliminates the requirement for the Budget Division of the Office of

26 practicable after the Governor transmits the proposed budget to the Legislature: (1)
27 the information required to be included in the proposed budget regarding the

36 previously approved by the respective office and in effect during the immediately

40 bill maintains the requirement to conduct and report this analysis but eliminates the
41 requirement for the Chief to establish a schedule for performing and reporting
42 the results of the analyses to ensure that the results of the analyses are included in
