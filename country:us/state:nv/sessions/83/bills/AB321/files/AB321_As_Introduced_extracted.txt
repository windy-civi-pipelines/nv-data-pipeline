EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; requiring a court to set aside a
judgment of conviction and grant a certificate of second
chance under certain circumstances; requiring the State
Forester Firewarden to establish a hiring program to
appoint certain former offenders to firefighting positions;
requiring a regulatory body to recognize a certificate of
second chance as removing any disqualification of a
person with a criminal history from obtaining a
professional or occupational license; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a court is authorized to defer proceedings for certain
2 defendants and place the defendant on probation upon certain terms and conditions
3 that must include the attendance and successful completion of certain programs.
4 Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, with certain exceptions, the court is
5 required, in certain circumstances, and authorized, under other circumstances, to set
6 aside the judgment of conviction. (NRS 176A.240, 176A.260, 176A.290) Section 2
7 of this bill authorizes a person convicted of certain criminal offenses to apply to the
8 court to have the judgment of conviction set aside and receive a certificate of
9 second chance. If the court grants the application to have the judgment set aside,
10 section 2 provides that the person must, with certain exceptions, be released from
11 all penalties imposed from the conviction.
12 Section 3 of this bill provides that if the court grants the application to have the
13 judgment of conviction set aside and the person was convicted of certain offenses,
14 the court must include a certificate of second chance which: (1) removes any
15 disqualification from obtaining a professional or occupational license on the basis
16 of the criminal history of the person; and (2) prohibits the criminal conviction from
17 being introduced as evidence in certain negligent hiring actions or housing actions.

22 Department of Corrections, is required to establish and carry out a program for
23 operating conservation camps in this State which may use offenders who meet

26 hiring program to appoint without competition former offenders who performed
27 firefighting work in such conservation camps to firefighting positions in the
28 Division of Forestry of the State Department of Conservation and Natural
29 Resources.
30 Under existing law, a position in the classified service of the Executive
31 Department of the State Government may be filled without competition only under

33 program established by the State Forester Firewarden pursuant to section 5 is an
