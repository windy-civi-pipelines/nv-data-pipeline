EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; [requiring a court to set aside a judgment of
conviction and grant a certificate of second chance under certain
circumstances;] authorizing the Director of the Department of
Corrections to establish a transitional housing program for certain
offenders to develop skills and training relating to forestry
management and conservation; requiring the State Forester
Firewarden to establish a hiring program to appoint certain former
offenders to firefighting positions; [requiring a regulatory body to
recognize a certificate of second chance as removing any
disqualification of a person with a criminal history from obtaining a
professional or occupational license;] and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, [a court is authorized to defer proceedings for certain defendants and
2 place the defendant on probation upon certain terms and conditions that must include the
3 attendance and successful completion of certain programs. Upon fulfillment of the terms and
4 conditions, with certain exceptions, the court is required, in certain circumstances, and
5 authorized, under other circumstances, to set aside the judgment of conviction. (NRS
6 176A.240, 176A.260, 176A.290) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a person convicted of certain
7 criminal offenses to apply to the court to have the judgment of conviction set aside and
8 receive a certificate of second chance. If the court grants the application to have the judgment
9 set aside, section 2 provides that the person must, with certain exceptions, be released from all
10 penalties imposed from the conviction.
11 Section 3 of this bill provides that if the court grants the application to have the judgment
12 of conviction set aside and the person was convicted of certain offenses, the court must
13 include a certificate of second chance which: (1) removes any disqualification from obtaining
14 a professional or occupational license on the basis of the criminal history of the person; and
15 (2) prohibits the criminal conviction from being introduced as evidence in certain negligent
16 hiring actions or housing actions. Section 6 of this bill requires a regulatory body to recognize
17 a certificate of second chance as removing any disqualification for a person with a criminal

18 history from obtaining a license from the regulatory body.] the Director of the Department
19 of Corrections is authorized to enter into one or more contracts with one or more public
20 or private entities to provide certain services to offenders, including transitional housing.
21 (NRS 209.4889) Section 4.5 of this bill authorizes the Director to establish, in
22 coordination with the Division of Forestry of the State Department of Conservation and
23 Natural Resources, a transitional housing program for certain offenders who are not
24 more than 18 months from eligibility for parole to receive training in forestry
25 management and conservation.
26 Under existing law, the State Forester Firewarden, in cooperation with the Department of
27 Corrections, is required to establish and carry out a program for operating conservation camps
28 in this State which may use offenders who meet certain requirements to perform certain work,
29 including firefighting. (NRS 209.457) Section 5 of this bill requires the State Forester
30 Firewarden to establish a hiring program to appoint [without competition] former offenders
31 who performed firefighting work in such conservation camps to firefighting positions in the
32 Division of Forestry of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
33 [Under existing law, a position in the classified service of the Executive Department of
34 the State Government may be filled without competition only under certain circumstances.
35 (NRS 284.305) Section 4 of this bill provides that the hiring program established by the State
36 Forester Firewarden pursuant to section 5 is an exception to this requirement.]
