AN ACT relating to alternative medicine; providing for the

naturopathic assistants by the Nevada Board of
Homeopathic and Naturopathic Medical Examiners;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation and licensure of homeopathic
2 physicians by the Nevada Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners. (Chapter
3 630A of NRS) The Board also certifies and regulates advanced practitioners of
4 homeopathy and homeopathic assistants. (NRS 630A.293-630A.299) This bill
5 generally provides for the regulation of naturopathic medicine and the licensure of
6 naturopathic physicians and the certification of naturopathic assistants by the
7 Board. Sections 33, 40 and 96 of this bill revise the name of the board to “Nevada
8 Board of Homeopathic and Naturopathic Medical Examiners” to reflect the new
9 authority and duties of the Board established by this bill. Sections 10 and 12 of this
10 bill define the terms “naturopathic assistant” and “naturopathic physician,”
11 respectively. Sections 11 and 16-18 of this bill: (1) define the practice of
12 naturopathic medicine; (2) set forth the scope of the practice of naturopathic
13 medicine; (3) provide the authorized methods of administration of natural
14 substances that may be administered by a naturopathic physician; (4) set forth the
15 requirements that a naturopathic physician must satisfy before administering
16 intravenous therapy in his or her practice; and (5) authorize a naturopathic
17 physician to dispense natural substances, drugs and devices, including certain
18 controlled substances. Sections 19-27 of this bill require the Board to: (1) license
-
*SB397*

– 2 –
19 naturopathic physicians; (2) certify naturopathic physicians as specialists; (3)
20 certify naturopathic assistants; (4) certify naturopathic medical students who wish
21 to participate in a program of clinical training for naturopathic medicine; and (5)
22 certify graduates of an approved school of naturopathic medicine who wish to
23 participate in an internship, preceptorship or fellowship training program. Sections
24 19-27 also establish certain requirements that an applicant for a license or
25 certificate must satisfy before the Board may issue the applicant such a license or
26 certificate. Section 28 of this bill requires naturopathic physicians to comply with
27 certain legal requirements governing the registration of births and deaths. Section
28 31 of this bill requires a naturopathic physician to take certain actions which are
29 also required of similar providers under existing law to assist a patient with an
30 opioid use disorder in accessing medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 630.3737,
31 632.2383, 633.6947, 641.2293, 641A.299, 641B.360, 641C.620) Section 50 of this
32 bill establishes certain procedures and requirements for renewing a license or
33 certificate, which are consistent with the procedures and requirements currently
34 applicable to practitioners of homeopathic medicine. Section 51 of this bill
35 establishes the fees for the issuance and renewal of a license or certificate issued
36 pursuant to sections 15 and 21-27. Sections 5-9, 13 and 14 of this bill define
37 certain other terms relating to the practice of naturopathic medicine and section 32
38 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definitions set forth in sections 5-14.
39 Sections 34, 36, 37 and 52-76 of this bill make the grounds and procedures that
40 are applicable to the investigation and discipline of homeopathic physicians,
41 advanced practitioners of homeopathy and homeopathic assistants, and the
42 unlicensed or uncertified practice of those professions, also applicable to
43 naturopathic physicians and naturopathic assistants and the unlicensed or
44 uncertified practice of those professions. Section 29 of this bill establishes
45 additional grounds for disciplinary action against all practitioners licensed by the
46 Board relating to medical records and reporting, and section 49 of this bill
47 authorizes the discipline of the holder of a limited license to practice homeopathic
48 medicine on those grounds. Section 75 prohibits misrepresenting that a school or
49 college of naturopathic medicine has been approved by the Board, and sections 43
50 and 76 of this bill prohibit the unlicensed practice of naturopathic medicine and
51 practice as a naturopathic assistant without the proper license or certificate.
52 Sections 38, 42, 44, 45, 47 and 48 of this bill make conforming changes to include
53 naturopathic physicians, naturopathic assistants and the practice of naturopathic
54 medicine within existing provisions currently applicable to homeopathic
55 physicians, advanced practitioners of homeopathy, homeopathic assistants and the
56 practice of homeopathic medicine, where appropriate. Section 39 of this bill
57 exempts certain persons from provisions governing homeopathic medicine and
58 naturopathic medicine. Section 46 of this bill limits to homeopathic physicians the
59 applicability of a provision relating to the examination of applicants for licensure as
60 a homeopathic physician. Section 40 expands the membership of the Board from
61 six members to eight members and section 41 of this bill requires that the
62 additional members added to the Board be naturopathic physicians who have
63 certain qualifications.
64 Existing law defines the term “physician” for the entirety of Nevada law,
65 except where specifically provided otherwise, to mean a person who engages in the
66 practice of medicine, including homeopathy. (NRS 0.040) Section 85 of this bill
67 includes within this definition a person who engages in the practice of naturopathic
68 medicine, thereby making certain provisions of existing law that are applicable to
69 all physicians also apply to naturopathic physicians, including provisions
70 concerning controlled substances and dangerous drugs. (Chapters 453 and 454 of
71 NRS) Sections 1 and 105-128 of this bill make revisions to treat naturopathic
72 physicians like other osteopathic and allopathic physicians for certain purposes
73 relating to provisions that require insurers to take, or refrain from taking, certain
-
*SB397*

– 3 –
74 actions with respect to certain policies of health insurance and medical malpractice
75 insurance.
76 Sections 77, 78, 81, 83 and 84 of this bill clarify that provisions of law
77 governing certain other professions do not apply to naturopathic physicians.
78 Sections 2, 3, 79, 80, 82, 86-95 and 97-104 of this bill make revisions to treat
79 naturopathic physicians and naturopathic assistants, where applicable, in the same
80 manner as other similar providers of health care in other certain respects.
81 Existing law defines “homeopathic medicine” to include noninvasive
82 electrodiagnosis, cell therapy, neural therapy, herbal therapy, neuromuscular
83 integration, orthomolecular therapy and nutrition. (NRS 630A.040) Existing
84 regulations interpret “neural therapy” and “orthomolecular therapy” to include the
85 prescription and administration of pharmaceutical preparations. Existing
86 regulations interpret “pharmaceutical preparations” to include narcotic drugs and
87 opiates that are listed as schedule II controlled substances regulated by the State
88 Board of Pharmacy. (NAC 630A.014) Sections 30 and 35 of this bill affirmatively
89 authorize a homeopathic physician to dispense, administer and prescribe certain
90 drugs, including some controlled substances, in the course of providing neural
91 therapy or orthomolecular therapy, so long as the dosage and administration of the
92 drugs conform with the standards of practice for those therapies and the
93 homeopathic physician meets certain other qualifications. Section 30 also clarifies
94 the authority of a homeopathic physician to prescribe, dispense and administer
95 certain controlled substances and dangerous drugs in certain other contexts, so long
96 as the drug is: (1) in an amount suitable for a single use; and (2) only used for the
97 purpose of diluting the drug into a homeopathic preparation in accordance with the
98 standards prescribed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States.
