EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; establishing that an applicable
privilege is not waived when certain entities disclose or
make available confidential information to the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada and certain other persons
and governmental entities; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes privileges for communications made under certain
2 circumstances, which authorize a person to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any
3 other person from disclosing, information contained in such privileged
4 communications. (Chapter 49 of NRS) With certain exceptions, existing law also
5 provides that a privilege is waived if a person who holds the privilege voluntarily
6 discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the information
7 contained in the privileged communication. (NRS 49.385)
8 With certain exceptions, the records and files in the possession of the Public
9 Utilities Commission of Nevada are public records and are required to be open at
10 all reasonable times to the public. (NRS 239.010, 703.190) Under existing law, the
11 Commission is authorized to: (1) keep confidential certain information in the
12 records of public utilities and other entities, including, without limitation, trade
13 secrets and confidential commercial information, that are required to be made
14 available to the Commission and its officers and employees; and (2) take such
15 actions as are necessary to prevent the disclosure of such information by persons

16 and governmental entities authorized by existing law to have access to such
17 confidential information. (NRS 703.190, 703.196)
18 This bill provides that if any such confidential information is also privileged,
19 the privilege is not waived as a result of the confidential information being
20 disclosed or made available to the Commission, its officers and employees, and
21 other persons and governmental entities authorized by existing law to have access
22 to the confidential information.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 703.196 is hereby amended to read as follows:

7 employee of the Commission, an affected governmental entity, any
8 officer or employee of an affected governmental entity, the Bureau
9 of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General or any
10 other person under the condition that the disclosure of such
11 information to the public be withheld or otherwise limited, must not
12 be disclosed to the public unless the Commission first determines
13 that the disclosure is justified.
14 2. The Commission shall take such actions as are necessary to
15 protect the confidentiality of such information, including, without

27 such information without the prior authorization of the Commission.

1 5. The Commission shall consider in an open meeting whether
2 the information reviewed or examined in a closed hearing may be
3 disclosed without revealing the confidential subject matter of the
4 information. To the extent the Commission determines the

6 of the records available to the public. Information which the

10 contained in any books, accounts, records, minutes, papers and

17 or any other officer or employee of the Commission, an affected
18 governmental entity, any officer or employee of an affected
19 governmental entity, the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the
