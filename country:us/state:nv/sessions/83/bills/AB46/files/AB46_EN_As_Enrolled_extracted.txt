Section 1:
on Growth and Infrastructure
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public utilities; establishing that an applicable
privilege is not waived when certain entities disclose or make
available confidential information to the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada and certain other persons and
governmental entities; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes privileges for communications made under certain
circumstances, which authorize a person to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any
other person from disclosing, information contained in such privileged
communications. (Chapter 49 of NRS) With certain exceptions, existing law also
provides that a privilege is waived if a person who holds the privilege voluntarily
discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the information
contained in the privileged communication. (NRS 49.385)
With certain exceptions, the records and files in the possession of the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada are public records and are required to be open at
all reasonable times to the public. (NRS 239.010, 703.190) Under existing law, the
Commission is authorized to: (1) keep confidential certain information in the
records of public utilities and other entities, including, without limitation, trade
secrets and confidential commercial information, that are required to be made
available to the Commission and its officers and employees; and (2) take such
actions as are necessary to prevent the disclosure of such information by persons
and governmental entities authorized by existing law to have access to such
confidential information. (NRS 703.190, 703.196)
This bill provides that if any such confidential information is also privileged,
the privilege is not waived as a result of the confidential information being
disclosed or made available to the Commission, its officers and employees, and
other persons and governmental entities authorized by existing law to have access
to the confidential information.
