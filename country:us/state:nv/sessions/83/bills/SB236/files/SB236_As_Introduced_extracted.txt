(BDR 3-222)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to real property; defining the terms “squatter” and
“tenant” for certain purposes relating to summary
proceedings for obtaining possession of real property, a
recreational vehicle or a mobile home; reducing the
period for seeking reentry of a dwelling and the return of
personal property contained therein under certain
circumstances; revising provisions governing the crime of
unlawful occupancy; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a crime to engage in housebreaking or unlawful
2 occupancy. (NRS 205.0813, 205.0817) Existing law also sets forth a procedure by
3 which: (1) an owner of a dwelling that is the object of a housebreaking or unlawful
4 occupancy may immediately retake possession and change the locks on the
5 dwelling; and (2) an unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out of
6 such a dwelling may seek reentry. (NRS 40.412, 40.416)
7 Section 1 of this bill defines the terms “squatter” and “tenant” for certain
8 purposes relating to summary proceedings for obtaining possession of real property,
9 a recreational vehicle or a mobile home and clarifies that a squatter is not a tenant
10 for such purposes. Section 2 of this bill reduces the period for which: (1) an
11 unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out of a dwelling has a
12 right to contest the matter by filing a verified complaint seeking reentry; and (2) the
13 owner of the dwelling is required to store the personal property of the unlawful or
14 unauthorized occupant. Section 3 of this bill clarifies the process by which an
15 unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out may seek the return of
16 his or her personal property. Section 4 of this bill expands the crime of unlawful
17 occupancy to make it unlawful to take up residence in a dwelling, regardless of
18 whether it is uninhabited or vacant, if a person knows or has reason to believe that
-

19 such residency is without permission of the owner of the dwelling or an authorized
20 representative of the owner.
