3 mobile application which offers or arranges for a reservation for on-premises
4 service for a customer at a food dispensing establishment and which is owned and
5 operated by a person other than the person who owns the food dispensing
6 establishment. This bill also defines “third-party restaurant reservation service
7 platform provider” to mean a person who operates a third-party restaurant
8 reservation service platform.

10 from listing, advertising, promoting or selling a reservation for on-premises service
11 for a customer at a food dispensing establishment through the third-party restaurant
12 reservation service platform of the provider unless the provider has entered into a
13 written agreement with the food dispensing establishment or a designee of the food
14 dispensing establishment that expressly authorizes the provider to engage in such
15 activities. This bill provides that a third-party restaurant reservation service
16 platform provider who violates that prohibition is subject to a civil penalty of
17 $1,000 per day for the violation, recoverable by the Attorney General or district
