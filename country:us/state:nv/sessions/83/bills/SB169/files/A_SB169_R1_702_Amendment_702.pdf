EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting a third-party reservation service
platform provider from engaging in certain activities; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill enacts certain provisions relating to a third-party reservation service
2 platform, which section 1 defines to mean, with certain exceptions, an Internet website, online
3 service or mobile application which offers or arranges for a reservation, appointment or
4 booking for a customer at an establishment and which is owned and operated by a person
5 other than the person who owns the establishment. Section 1 also defines “third-party
6 reservation service platform provider” to mean a person who operates a third-party reservation
7 service platform.
8 Section 1 prohibits a third-party reservation service platform provider from listing,
9 advertising, promoting or selling a reservation, appointment or booking for a customer at any
10 establishment through the third-party reservation service platform of the provider unless the
11 provider has entered into a written agreement with the establishment or a designee of the
12 establishment that expressly authorizes the provider to engage in such activities. Section 1
13 makes it a deceptive trade practice for a third-party reservation service platform provider to
14 violate that prohibition. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a person who violates the
15 provisions of section 1 is not subject to any criminal penalty set forth in existing law for
16 engaging in a deceptive trade practice, meaning such a person is subject only to the various
17 civil enforcement measures, including civil penalties, set forth in existing law for engaging in
18 a deceptive trade practice. Section 1 also exempts a document preparation service from
19 the provisions of section 1.
