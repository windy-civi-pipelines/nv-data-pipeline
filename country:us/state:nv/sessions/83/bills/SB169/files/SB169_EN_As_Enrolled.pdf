Senate Bill No. 169–Senators Doñate;
Buck and Steinbeck
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting a third-party
reservation service platform provider from engaging in
certain activities; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 1 of this bill enacts certain provisions relating to a third-party
reservation service platform, which section 1 defines to mean, with certain
exceptions, an Internet website, online service or mobile application which offers or
arranges for a reservation, appointment or booking for a customer at an
establishment and which is owned and operated by a person other than the person
who owns the establishment. Section 1 also defines “third-party reservation service
platform provider” to mean a person who operates a third-party reservation service
platform.
Section 1 prohibits a third-party reservation service platform provider from
listing, advertising, promoting or selling a reservation, appointment or booking for
a customer at any establishment through the third-party reservation service platform
of the provider unless the provider has entered into a written agreement with the
establishment or a designee of the establishment that expressly authorizes the
provider to engage in such activities. Section 1 makes it a deceptive trade practice
for a third-party reservation service platform provider to violate that prohibition.
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a person who violates the provisions of
section 1 is not subject to any criminal penalty set forth in existing law for
engaging in a deceptive trade practice, meaning such a person is subject only to the
various civil enforcement measures, including civil penalties, set forth in existing
law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice. Section 1 also exempts a document
preparation service from the provisions of section 1.
