Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
2 (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Under existing law, financial institutions, certain
3 mining businesses and other employers are required to pay an excise tax (the
4 modified business tax) on the wages paid by them. (NRS 363A.130, 363B.110) The
5 Program establishes a credit against the modified business tax paid by certain
6 businesses equal to an amount which is approved by the Department of Taxation
-

7 and which must not exceed the amount of any donation of money which is made by
8 a taxpayer to a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of pupils
9 who are members of a household with a household income which is not more than
10 300 percent of the federally designated level signifying poverty to attend schools in
11 this State, including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of
12 those pupils. (NRS 363A.130, 363A.139, 363B.110, 363B.119, 388D.270) Existing
13 law authorizes the Department, each fiscal year, to approve applications for the
14 credit under the Program until the total amount of credits authorized and approved
15 by the Department is $6,655,000. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 11 and 12
16 of this bill increase the total amount of credits that the Department is authorized to
17 approve to $8,725,000 for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $10,725,000 for Fiscal Year
18 2026-2027 and each subsequent fiscal year.
19 Existing law requires each school in which a pupil is enrolled for whom a grant
20 is provided by a scholarship organization to maintain a record of the academic
21 progress of the pupil in such a manner that the information may be aggregated and
22 reported for all such pupils if reporting is required by the Department of Education.
23 (NRS 388D.270) Section 10 of this bill requires each school in which a pupil is
24 enrolled for whom a grant is provided by a scholarship organization to submit to
25 the Department of Education, on or before August 1 of each year, a report on the
26 academic progress of all such pupils during the immediately preceding school year.
27 Section 10 requires the report to include certain information regarding such pupils
28 and be accompanied by a statement from the owner, executive head or chair of the
29 governing body of the school certifying that the information included in the report
30 is complete and accurate. Section 10 requires the Department of Education to
31 compile and analyze the data included in such reports to evaluate the impact of the
32 Program and submit an anonymized summary of the data to the Governor, the State
33 Board of Education and, in alternating years, the Legislature and the Joint Interim
34 Standing Committee on Education. Section 10 authorizes the Department of
35 Education to suspend or disqualify a school from receiving grants on behalf of
36 pupils if the school fails to comply with the reporting requirement. Section 10
37 prohibits a scholarship organization from making a grant to a school that has been
38 suspended or disqualified from receiving grants.
39 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
40 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections 2-
41 7 of this bill codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
42 Statutes. Section 2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
43 Department of Education by submitting certain information. Section 3 requires: (1)
44 a registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department of Education
45 certain information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and
46 (2) the Department of Education to compile certain information submitted by each
47 scholarship organization and review the information to determine whether to
48 recommend a change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section
49 4 requires a registered scholarship organization to: (1) provide to the Department of
50 Education certain financial statements; (2) notify the Department of Education if
51 the scholarship organization ceases to qualify as a scholarship organization or
52 ceases to exist; and (3) allow the Superintendent of Public Instruction or his or her
53 designee to inspect the records of the scholarship organization. Section 5 requires a
54 registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
55 donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
56 donation for more than 5 years. Section 6 requires the Department of Education to:
57 (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
58 Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
59 Department to the Department of Taxation quarterly; and (3) submit a summary of
60 certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
61 Section 7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
-
*AB599*
– 3 –
62 scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
63 a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 7 also requires a
64 scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
65 pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.
66 Section 8 of this bill adds sections 2-7 to the provisions that may be cited as the
67 Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program and section 9 of this bill applies
68 the existing definition of “scholarship organization” to those sections.

24 of Taxation for the credit authorized by subsection 1, the amount of
25 the credit provided by this section is equal to the amount approved
26 by the Department of Taxation pursuant to subsection 2, which must

(ON BEHALF OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCE
IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR)

____________
Referred to Committee on Ways and Means
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the Nevada
Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
(BDR 34-1157)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring a scholarship organization
to register in order to participate in the Nevada
Educational Choice Scholarship Program; limiting the
period that a donation to a scholarship organization may
be carried forward; requiring the Department of
Education and scholarship organizations to report certain
information; providing the procedure for applying for a
grant; requiring a scholarship organization to establish
certain procedures; establishing the order of priority in
which grants must be awarded; requiring a school that
receives a grant on behalf of a pupil under the Program to
report certain information regarding the academic
progress of such pupils; increasing the total amount of
credits the Department of Taxation is authorized to
approve each fiscal year under the Program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
2 (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Under existing law, financial institutions, certain
3 mining businesses and other employers are required to pay an excise tax (the
4 modified business tax) on the wages paid by them. (NRS 363A.130, 363B.110) The
5 Program establishes a credit against the modified business tax paid by certain
6 businesses equal to an amount which is approved by the Department of Taxation
-

7 and which must not exceed the amount of any donation of money which is made by
8 a taxpayer to a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of pupils
9 who are members of a household with a household income which is not more than
10 300 percent of the federally designated level signifying poverty to attend schools in
11 this State, including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of
12 those pupils. (NRS 363A.130, 363A.139, 363B.110, 363B.119, 388D.270) Existing
13 law authorizes the Department, each fiscal year, to approve applications for the
14 credit under the Program until the total amount of credits authorized and approved
15 by the Department is $6,655,000. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 11 and 12
16 of this bill increase the total amount of credits that the Department is authorized to
17 approve to $8,725,000 for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and $10,725,000 for Fiscal Year
18 2026-2027 and each subsequent fiscal year.
19 Existing law requires each school in which a pupil is enrolled for whom a grant
20 is provided by a scholarship organization to maintain a record of the academic
21 progress of the pupil in such a manner that the information may be aggregated and
22 reported for all such pupils if reporting is required by the Department of Education.
23 (NRS 388D.270) Section 10 of this bill requires each school in which a pupil is
24 enrolled for whom a grant is provided by a scholarship organization to submit to
25 the Department of Education, on or before August 1 of each year, a report on the
26 academic progress of all such pupils during the immediately preceding school year.
27 Section 10 requires the report to include certain information regarding such pupils
28 and be accompanied by a statement from the owner, executive head or chair of the
29 governing body of the school certifying that the information included in the report
30 is complete and accurate. Section 10 requires the Department of Education to
31 compile and analyze the data included in such reports to evaluate the impact of the
32 Program and submit an anonymized summary of the data to the Governor, the State
33 Board of Education and, in alternating years, the Legislature and the Joint Interim
34 Standing Committee on Education. Section 10 authorizes the Department of
35 Education to suspend or disqualify a school from receiving grants on behalf of
36 pupils if the school fails to comply with the reporting requirement. Section 10
37 prohibits a scholarship organization from making a grant to a school that has been
38 suspended or disqualified from receiving grants.
39 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
40 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections 2-
41 7 of this bill codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
42 Statutes. Section 2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
43 Department of Education by submitting certain information. Section 3 requires: (1)
44 a registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department of Education
45 certain information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and
46 (2) the Department of Education to compile certain information submitted by each
47 scholarship organization and review the information to determine whether to
48 recommend a change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section
49 4 requires a registered scholarship organization to: (1) provide to the Department of
50 Education certain financial statements; (2) notify the Department of Education if
51 the scholarship organization ceases to qualify as a scholarship organization or
52 ceases to exist; and (3) allow the Superintendent of Public Instruction or his or her
53 designee to inspect the records of the scholarship organization. Section 5 requires a
54 registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
55 donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
56 donation for more than 5 years. Section 6 requires the Department of Education to:
57 (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
58 Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
59 Department to the Department of Taxation quarterly; and (3) submit a summary of
60 certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
61 Section 7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
-
*AB599*

– 3 –
62 scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
63 a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 7 also requires a
64 scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
65 pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.
66 Section 8 of this bill adds sections 2-7 to the provisions that may be cited as the
67 Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program and section 9 of this bill applies
68 the existing definition of “scholarship organization” to those sections.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

11 on an Internet website maintained by the scholarship organization
12 and provide a written copy of the procedures with each application
13 form.

19 (d) Verify annually that each pupil on behalf of whom the
20 scholarship organization awards a grant is a member of a
21 household that has a household income which is not more than
22 300 percent of the federally designated level signifying poverty.
23 Such verification must:

27 (2) Calculate household income based on the information
28 reported in the application submitted on behalf of the pupil and in

30 and Nutrition Service of the United State Department of
31 Agriculture for determining eligibility of pupils for free and

40 is awarded on behalf of any other pupil.

4 described in paragraph (a) or (b) in the order in which the
5 completed application is received. If there are an insufficient
6 number of grants available to award a grant on behalf of each
7 pupil for whom a complete application was received on the same
8 day:
9 (1) A grant must be awarded on behalf of a pupil who is a
10 member of a household that has a lower household income before
11 a grant is awarded on behalf of a pupil who is a member of a
12 household that has a higher household income;
13 (2) If two or more applicants are members of households
14 that have the same household income, a grant must be awarded on
15 behalf of the pupil who is enrolled in a public school that has
16 received a lower rating based on the most recent annual report of
17 the statewide system of accountability for public schools before a
18 grant is awarded on behalf of a pupil who is enrolled in a public
19 school that has received higher ratings; and
20 (3) If two or more applicants are members of households
21 that have the same household income and attend public schools
22 that received the same rating based on the most recent annual
23 report of the statewide system of accountability for public schools,
24 grants must be awarded on behalf of pupils in this category on a
25 random basis.
