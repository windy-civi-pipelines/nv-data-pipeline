EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition, administration,
collection and enforcement of a tax on certain digital products
electronically transferred to a purchaser; [decreasing the Nevada gross
revenue threshold at which certain business entities engaged in
business in this State are required to pay the commerce tax; eliminating
an exemption from the tax on live entertainment for athletic events
conducted by certain professional sports teams;] prohibiting the
issuance and use of certain transferable tax credits if money is
transferred or allocated from the Account to Stabilize the
Operation of the State Government; stating the intent of the
Legislature to review the transferable tax credits which the State is
authorized to issue under certain circumstance; providing penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of specified
2 digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of specified digital
3 products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in this State for which the tax
4 was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this bill establishes requirements for
5 determining the place where a sale of specified digital products takes place for the purpose of
6 the tax. Under sections 24 and 33, the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate
7 imposed in the county in which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as
8 determined pursuant to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose,
9 collect and remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
10 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the
11 retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions that took place in
12 this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this State. Sections 2-22, 25-32,
Assembly Amendment No. 470 to Assembly Bill No. 453 Page 4
13 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the administration, collection and enforcement of
14 the tax in the same manner as the sales and use tax.
15 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of specified
16 digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or
17 the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than $100,000 of gross receipts from certain
18 transactions made to customers in this State or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions,
19 on its own behalf or on behalf of a seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a
20 seller whereby the seller agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of
21 the tax. Section 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax
22 under certain circumstances.
23 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
24 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration from a
25 customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to customers in this
26 State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross receipts of sales
27 resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the person complies with certain notice
28 requirements and makes a monthly report to the Department of Taxation.
29 [Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity whose Nevada
30 gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000, with the rate of commerce tax based on the
31 industry in which the business entity is primarily engaged. (NRS 363C.200, 363C.300-
32 363C.560) Section 128 of this bill decreases the Nevada gross revenue threshold at which the
33 commerce tax is imposed upon a business entity from $4,000,000 earned in a fiscal year to
34 $3,500,000 earned in a fiscal year. Sections 129-155 of this bill make conforming changes to
35 reflect the decrease in the Nevada gross revenue threshold from $4,000,000 to $3,500,000 for
36 the purpose of calculating the rate of the commerce tax for certain industries in which a
37 business entity is primarily engaged.
38 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax on admission to certain facilities
39 where live entertainment is provided. (Chapter 368A of NRS) Existing law exempts from the
40 excise tax an athletic contest, event or exhibition conducted by a professional team based in
41 this State and in which the team participates. (NRS 368A.200) Section 156 of this bill
42 eliminates the exemption from the excise tax on live entertainment for such athletic contests,
43 events or exhibitions.]
44 Existing law creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State Government,
45 also known as the Rainy Day Fund, and authorizes the Director of the Office of Finance
46 in the Office of the Governor to request a transfer of money from the Account to the
47 State General Fund if: (1) the total actual revenue of the State falls short by 5 percent or
48 more of the total anticipated revenue for the biennium in which the transfer will be
49 made, as determined by the Legislature or the Interim Finance Committee; or (2) the
50 Legislature or Interim Finance Committee and the Governor declare that a fiscal
51 emergency exists. The Legislature may also allocate money from the Account directly.
52 (NRS 353.288) Section 157.3 of this bill prohibits the issuance of transferable tax credits
53 or the application of transferable tax credits to state or local taxes during any fiscal year
54 in which a transfer or allocation is made from the Account by the Interim Finance
55 Committee or during a fiscal emergency by the Legislature. Section 157.3 limits this
56 prohibition to transferable tax credits authorized by state legislation that is enacted on
57 or after the effective date of section 157.3.
58 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before July 1 of each even-numbered
59 year, to impanel and Economic Forum consisting of economic and financial experts
60 appointed by the Governor to provide an estimate of the revenue that will be collected
61 by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the subsequent biennium and make
62 such projections for economic indicators as the Economic Forum deems necessary to
63 ensure that this estimate is accurate. (NRS 353.226, 353.228) Section 157.7 of this bill
64 provides that, if the Economic Forum forecasts that such revenue in the subsequent
65 biennium will be less than in the then-current biennium and that the reduction in
66 revenue exceeds 7 percent, it is the intent of the Legislature to review any transferable
67 tax credits which the State is authorized to issue and consider if the amount of such
68 credits should be reduced.
69 Section 160 of this bill establishes [July 1, 2025, as the effective date of the provisions of
70 this bill relating to commerce tax and the live entertainment tax, and establishes] January 1,
Assembly Amendment No. 470 to Assembly Bill No. 453 Page 5
71 2026, as the effective date of the provisions of this bill . [relating to the imposition of a tax on
72 the retail sale of specified digital goods.]

10 Sec. 29. For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to
11 prevent evasion of the tax imposed by section 24 of this act, it is presumed that all
12 gross receipts are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. The burden
13 of proving that a sale of specified digital products is not a sale at retail is upon
14 the person who makes the sale unless the person takes from the purchaser a
15 certificate to the effect that the specified digital products were purchased by an
16 end user and the purchaser:
17 1. Is engaged in the business of commercial broadcasting, rebroadcasting,
18 transmitting, retransmitting, licensing, relicensing, distributing, redistributing or
19 exhibiting specified digital products, in whole or in part, to another person or

30 1. Be substantially in such form and include such information as the
31 Department may prescribe; and
32 2. Unless submitted in electronic form, be signed by the purchaser.
33 Sec. 31. 1. If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate makes any use of
34 specified digital products other than the commercial broadcasting,
35 rebroadcasting, transmitting, retransmitting, licensing, relicensing, distributing,
36 redistributing or exhibiting of the specified digital products, in whole or in part,
37 to another person or persons in the regular course of business:
38 (a) The use is taxable to the purchaser as of the time one of the specified
39 digital products is first so used by the purchaser, and the sales price of the
40 specified digital products to the purchaser is the measure of the tax.
41 (b) The seller is liable for the tax with respect to the sale of the specified
42 digital products to the purchaser only if:
43 (1) There is an unsatisfied use tax liability pursuant to paragraph (a);
44 and

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition, administration,
collection and enforcement of a tax on certain digital products
electronically transferred to a purchaser; [decreasing the Nevada gross
revenue threshold at which certain business entities engaged in
business in this State are required to pay the commerce tax; eliminating
an exemption from the tax on live entertainment for athletic events
conducted by certain professional sports teams;] prohibiting the
issuance and use of certain transferable tax credits if money is
transferred or allocated from the Account to Stabilize the
Operation of the State Government; stating the intent of the
Legislature to review the transferable tax credits which the State is
authorized to issue under certain circumstance; providing penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of specified
2 digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of specified digital
3 products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in this State for which the tax
4 was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this bill establishes requirements for
5 determining the place where a sale of specified digital products takes place for the purpose of
6 the tax. Under sections 24 and 33, the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate
7 imposed in the county in which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as
8 determined pursuant to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose,
9 collect and remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
10 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the
11 retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions that took place in
12 this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this State. Sections 2-22, 25-32,

Assembly Amendment No. 470 to Assembly Bill No. 453 Page 4
13 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the administration, collection and enforcement of
14 the tax in the same manner as the sales and use tax.
15 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of specified
16 digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or
17 the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than $100,000 of gross receipts from certain
18 transactions made to customers in this State or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions,
19 on its own behalf or on behalf of a seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a
20 seller whereby the seller agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of
21 the tax. Section 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax
22 under certain circumstances.
23 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
24 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration from a
25 customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to customers in this
26 State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative gross receipts of sales
27 resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the person complies with certain notice
28 requirements and makes a monthly report to the Department of Taxation.
29 [Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity whose Nevada
30 gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000, with the rate of commerce tax based on the
31 industry in which the business entity is primarily engaged. (NRS 363C.200, 363C.300-
32 363C.560) Section 128 of this bill decreases the Nevada gross revenue threshold at which the
33 commerce tax is imposed upon a business entity from $4,000,000 earned in a fiscal year to
34 $3,500,000 earned in a fiscal year. Sections 129-155 of this bill make conforming changes to
35 reflect the decrease in the Nevada gross revenue threshold from $4,000,000 to $3,500,000 for
36 the purpose of calculating the rate of the commerce tax for certain industries in which a
37 business entity is primarily engaged.
38 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax on admission to certain facilities
39 where live entertainment is provided. (Chapter 368A of NRS) Existing law exempts from the
40 excise tax an athletic contest, event or exhibition conducted by a professional team based in
41 this State and in which the team participates. (NRS 368A.200) Section 156 of this bill
42 eliminates the exemption from the excise tax on live entertainment for such athletic contests,
43 events or exhibitions.]
44 Existing law creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State Government,
45 also known as the Rainy Day Fund, and authorizes the Director of the Office of Finance
46 in the Office of the Governor to request a transfer of money from the Account to the
47 State General Fund if: (1) the total actual revenue of the State falls short by 5 percent or
48 more of the total anticipated revenue for the biennium in which the transfer will be
49 made, as determined by the Legislature or the Interim Finance Committee; or (2) the
50 Legislature or Interim Finance Committee and the Governor declare that a fiscal
51 emergency exists. The Legislature may also allocate money from the Account directly.
52 (NRS 353.288) Section 157.3 of this bill prohibits the issuance of transferable tax credits
53 or the application of transferable tax credits to state or local taxes during any fiscal year
54 in which a transfer or allocation is made from the Account by the Interim Finance
55 Committee or during a fiscal emergency by the Legislature. Section 157.3 limits this
56 prohibition to transferable tax credits authorized by state legislation that is enacted on
57 or after the effective date of section 157.3.
58 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before July 1 of each even-numbered
59 year, to impanel and Economic Forum consisting of economic and financial experts
60 appointed by the Governor to provide an estimate of the revenue that will be collected
61 by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the subsequent biennium and make
62 such projections for economic indicators as the Economic Forum deems necessary to
63 ensure that this estimate is accurate. (NRS 353.226, 353.228) Section 157.7 of this bill
64 provides that, if the Economic Forum forecasts that such revenue in the subsequent
65 biennium will be less than in the then-current biennium and that the reduction in
66 revenue exceeds 7 percent, it is the intent of the Legislature to review any transferable
67 tax credits which the State is authorized to issue and consider if the amount of such
68 credits should be reduced.
69 Section 160 of this bill establishes [July 1, 2025, as the effective date of the provisions of
70 this bill relating to commerce tax and the live entertainment tax, and establishes] January 1,

Assembly Amendment No. 470 to Assembly Bill No. 453 Page 5
71 2026, as the effective date of the provisions of this bill . [relating to the imposition of a tax on
72 the retail sale of specified digital goods.]

35 transferable tax credits should be reduced.
36 Sec. 158. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
