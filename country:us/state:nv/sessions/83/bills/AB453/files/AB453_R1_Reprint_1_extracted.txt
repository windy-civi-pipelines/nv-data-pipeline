EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a tax on
certain digital products electronically transferred to a
purchaser; prohibiting the issuance and use of certain
transferable tax credits if money is transferred or allocated
from the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
Government; stating the intent of the Legislature to
review the transferable tax credits which the State is
authorized to issue under certain circumstance; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of
2 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of
3 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in
4 this State for which the tax was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this
5 bill establishes requirements for determining the place where a sale of specified
6 digital products takes place for the purpose of the tax. Under sections 24 and 33,
7 the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate imposed in the county in
8 which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as determined pursuant
-
*AB453_R1*
– 2 –
9 to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose, collect and
10 remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
11 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar
12 year, the retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions
13 that took place in this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this
14 State. Sections 2-22, 25-32, 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the
15 administration, collection and enforcement of the tax in the same manner as the
16 sales and use tax.
17 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of
18 specified digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately
19 preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than
20 $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions made to customers in this State
21 or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions, on its own behalf or on behalf of a
22 seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a seller whereby the seller
23 agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section
24 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under
25 certain circumstances.
26 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
27 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration
28 from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to
29 customers in this State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative
30 gross receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the
31 person complies with certain notice requirements and makes a monthly report to the
32 Department of Taxation.
33 Existing law creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
34 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, and authorizes the Director of the
35 Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor to request a transfer of money from
36 the Account to the State General Fund if: (1) the total actual revenue of the State
37 falls short by 5 percent or more of the total anticipated revenue for the biennium in
38 which the transfer will be made, as determined by the Legislature or the Interim
39 Finance Committee; or (2) the Legislature or Interim Finance Committee and the
40 Governor declare that a fiscal emergency exists. The Legislature may also allocate
41 money from the Account directly. (NRS 353.288) Section 157.3 of this bill
42 prohibits the issuance of transferable tax credits or the application of transferable
43 tax credits to state or local taxes during any fiscal year in which a transfer or
44 allocation is made from the Account by the Interim Finance Committee or during a
45 fiscal emergency by the Legislature. Section 157.3 limits this prohibition to
46 transferable tax credits authorized by state legislation that is enacted on or after the
47 effective date of section 157.3.
48 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before July 1 of each even-numbered
49 year, to impanel an Economic Forum consisting of economic and financial experts
50 appointed by the Governor to provide an estimate of the revenue that will be
51 collected by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the subsequent biennium
52 and make such projections for economic indicators as the Economic Forum deems
53 necessary to ensure that this estimate is accurate. (NRS 353.226, 353.228) Section
54 157.7 of this bill provides that, if the Economic Forum forecasts that such revenue
55 in the subsequent biennium will be less than in the then-current biennium and that
56 the reduction in revenue exceeds 7 percent, it is the intent of the Legislature to
57 review any transferable tax credits which the State is authorized to issue and
58 consider if the amount of such credits should be reduced.
59 Section 160 of this bill establishes January 1, 2026, as the effective date of the
60 provisions of this bill.

13 chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax imposed by section 24 of
14 this act, it is presumed that all gross receipts are subject to the tax
15 until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale
16 of specified digital products is not a sale at retail is upon the
17 person who makes the sale unless the person takes from the
18 purchaser a certificate to the effect that the specified digital
19 products were purchased by an end user and the purchaser:
20 1. Is engaged in the business of commercial broadcasting,
21 rebroadcasting, transmitting, retransmitting, licensing,
22 relicensing, distributing, redistributing or exhibiting specified
23 digital products, in whole or in part, to another person or persons;

28 relicense, distribute, redistribute or exhibit the specified digital
29 product in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain
30 at the time of purchase whether the specified digital product will
31 be used for such a purpose or will be used for some other purpose.
32 Sec. 30. A resale certificate must:
33 1. Be substantially in such form and include such
34 information as the Department may prescribe; and
35 2. Unless submitted in electronic form, be signed by the
36 purchaser.
37 Sec. 31. 1. If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate
38 makes any use of specified digital products other than the
39 commercial broadcasting, rebroadcasting, transmitting,
40 retransmitting, licensing, relicensing, distributing, redistributing
41 or exhibiting of the specified digital products, in whole or in part,
42 to another person or persons in the regular course of business:
43 (a) The use is taxable to the purchaser as of the time one of the
44 specified digital products is first so used by the purchaser, and
-
*AB453_R1*
– 11 –
1 the sales price of the specified digital products to the purchaser is
2 the measure of the tax.
3 (b) The seller is liable for the tax with respect to the sale of the
4 specified digital products to the purchaser only if:
5 (1) There is an unsatisfied use tax liability pursuant to
6 paragraph (a); and
7 (2) The seller fraudulently failed to collect the tax or
8 solicited the purchaser to provide the resale certificate unlawfully.
9 2. As used in this section, “seller” includes a certified service
10 provider, as that term is defined in NRS 360B.060, acting on
11 behalf of a seller who is registered pursuant to NRS 360B.200.
12 Sec. 32. Any person who gives a resale certificate for
13 specified digital products which the person knows at the time of
14 purchase is not to be further broadcast, rebroadcast, transmitted,
15 retransmitted, licensed, relicensed, distributed, redistributed or
16 exhibited by the person in the regular course of business for the
17 purpose of evading payment to the seller of the amount of the tax
18 applicable to the transaction is guilty of a misdemeanor.
19 Sec. 33. 1. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the use in
20 this State of specified digital products purchased and
21 electronically transferred from any retailer on or after January 1,
22 2026, for use in this State at a rate equal to the sum of the rates of
23 all taxes imposed upon the storage, use or other consumption of
24 tangible personal property in the county in which the use of the
25 specified digital products occurs.
26 2. The tax imposed by subsection 1 applies whether the
27 purchaser obtains permanent use or less than permanent use of
28 the specified digital product, whether the sale is conditioned or not
29 conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser and
30 whether the sale is on a subscription basis or is not on a
31 subscription basis.
32 3. The tax is imposed with respect to all specified digital
33 products which were electronically transferred in a transaction
34 that is taxable pursuant to this chapter but for which the tax

9 including, without limitation, any officer or department of this State
10 or any political subdivision or agency of this State, who has in his or

12 personal property belonging to the delinquent, or owing any debts to
13 the delinquent or person against whom a determination has been
14 made which remains unpaid, or owing any debts to the delinquent or
15 that person. In the case of any state officer, department or agency,
16 the notice must be given to the officer, department or agency before
17 the Department presents the claim of the delinquent taxpayer to the
18 State Controller.
19 2. A state officer, department or agency which receives such a

23 by the demand may not transfer or otherwise dispose of the credits,

34 person.
35 5. If the property of the delinquent taxpayer consists of a series
36 of payments owed to him or her, the person who owes or controls
37 the payments shall transmit the payments to the Department until
38 otherwise notified by the Department. If the debt of the delinquent
39 taxpayer is not paid within 1 year after the Department issued the
40 original demand to transmit, the Department shall issue another
41 demand to transmit to the person responsible for making the
42 payments informing him or her to continue to transmit payments to
43 the Department or that his or her duty to transmit the payments to
44 the Department has ceased.

1 6. If the notice of the delinquency seeks to prevent the transfer
2 or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or credit union or other
3 credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of
4 a bank, credit union or other depository institution, the notice must
5 be delivered or mailed to any branch or office of the bank, credit
6 union or other depository institution at which the deposit is carried
7 or at which the credits or personal property is held.
8 7. If any person notified by the notice of the delinquency
9 makes any transfer or other disposition of the property or debts
10 required to be withheld or transmitted, to the extent of the value of
11 the property or the amount of the debts thus transferred or paid, that
12 person is liable to the State for any indebtedness due pursuant to this

17 respect to whose obligation the notice was given if solely by reason

Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to taxation.
(BDR 32-895)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a tax on
certain digital products electronically transferred to a
purchaser; prohibiting the issuance and use of certain
transferable tax credits if money is transferred or allocated
from the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
Government; stating the intent of the Legislature to
review the transferable tax credits which the State is
authorized to issue under certain circumstance; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of
2 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of
3 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in
4 this State for which the tax was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this
5 bill establishes requirements for determining the place where a sale of specified
6 digital products takes place for the purpose of the tax. Under sections 24 and 33,
7 the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate imposed in the county in
8 which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as determined pursuant
-
*AB453_R1*

– 2 –
9 to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose, collect and
10 remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
11 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar
12 year, the retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions
13 that took place in this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this
14 State. Sections 2-22, 25-32, 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the
15 administration, collection and enforcement of the tax in the same manner as the
16 sales and use tax.
17 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of
18 specified digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately
19 preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than
20 $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions made to customers in this State
21 or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions, on its own behalf or on behalf of a
22 seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a seller whereby the seller
23 agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section
24 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under
25 certain circumstances.
26 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
27 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration
28 from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to
29 customers in this State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative
30 gross receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the
31 person complies with certain notice requirements and makes a monthly report to the
32 Department of Taxation.
33 Existing law creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
34 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, and authorizes the Director of the
35 Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor to request a transfer of money from
36 the Account to the State General Fund if: (1) the total actual revenue of the State
37 falls short by 5 percent or more of the total anticipated revenue for the biennium in
38 which the transfer will be made, as determined by the Legislature or the Interim
39 Finance Committee; or (2) the Legislature or Interim Finance Committee and the
40 Governor declare that a fiscal emergency exists. The Legislature may also allocate
41 money from the Account directly. (NRS 353.288) Section 157.3 of this bill
42 prohibits the issuance of transferable tax credits or the application of transferable
43 tax credits to state or local taxes during any fiscal year in which a transfer or
44 allocation is made from the Account by the Interim Finance Committee or during a
45 fiscal emergency by the Legislature. Section 157.3 limits this prohibition to
46 transferable tax credits authorized by state legislation that is enacted on or after the
47 effective date of section 157.3.
48 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before July 1 of each even-numbered
49 year, to impanel an Economic Forum consisting of economic and financial experts
50 appointed by the Governor to provide an estimate of the revenue that will be
51 collected by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the subsequent biennium
52 and make such projections for economic indicators as the Economic Forum deems
53 necessary to ensure that this estimate is accurate. (NRS 353.226, 353.228) Section
54 157.7 of this bill provides that, if the Economic Forum forecasts that such revenue
55 in the subsequent biennium will be less than in the then-current biennium and that
56 the reduction in revenue exceeds 7 percent, it is the intent of the Legislature to
57 review any transferable tax credits which the State is authorized to issue and
58 consider if the amount of such credits should be reduced.
59 Section 160 of this bill establishes January 1, 2026, as the effective date of the
60 provisions of this bill.
