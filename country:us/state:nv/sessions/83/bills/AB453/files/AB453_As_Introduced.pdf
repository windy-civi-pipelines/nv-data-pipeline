EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a tax on
certain digital products electronically transferred to a
purchaser; decreasing the Nevada gross revenue threshold
at which certain business entities engaged in business in
this State are required to pay the commerce tax;
eliminating an exemption from the tax on live
entertainment for athletic events conducted by certain
professional sports teams; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of
2 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of
3 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in
4 this State for which the tax was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this
5 bill establishes requirements for determining the place where a sale of specified
6 digital products takes place for the purpose of the tax. Under sections 24 and 33,
7 the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate imposed in the county in
8 which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as determined pursuant
9 to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose, collect and
10 remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
11 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar
12 year, the retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions
13 that took place in this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this
14 State. Sections 2-22, 25-32, 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the
15 administration, collection and enforcement of the tax in the same manner as the
16 sales and use tax.

17 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of
18 specified digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately
19 preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than
20 $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions made to customers in this State
21 or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions, on its own behalf or on behalf of a
22 seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a seller whereby the seller
23 agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section
24 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under
25 certain circumstances.
26 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
27 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration
28 from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to
29 customers in this State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative
30 gross receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the
31 person complies with certain notice requirements and makes a monthly report to the
32 Department of Taxation.
33 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity whose
34 Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000, with the rate of
35 commerce tax based on the industry in which the business entity is primarily
36 engaged. (NRS 363C.200, 363C.300-363C.560) Section 128 of this bill decreases
37 the Nevada gross revenue threshold at which the commerce tax is imposed upon a
38 business entity from $4,000,000 earned in a fiscal year to $3,500,000 earned in a
39 fiscal year. Sections 129-155 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
40 decrease in the Nevada gross revenue threshold from $4,000,000 to $3,500,000 for
41 the purpose of calculating the rate of the commerce tax for certain industries in
42 which a business entity is primarily engaged.
43 Existing law provides for the imposition of an excise tax on admission to
44 certain facilities where live entertainment is provided. (Chapter 368A of NRS)
45 Existing law exempts from the excise tax an athletic contest, event or exhibition
46 conducted by a professional team based in this State and in which the team
47 participates. (NRS 368A.200) Section 156 of this bill eliminates the exemption
48 from the excise tax on live entertainment for such athletic contests, events or
49 exhibitions.
50 Section 160 of this bill establishes July 1, 2025, as the effective date of the
51 provisions of this bill relating to commerce tax and the live entertainment tax, and
52 establishes January 1, 2026, as the effective date of the provisions of this bill
53 relating to the imposition of a tax on the retail sale of specified digital goods.

*AB453*

– 10 –

1 purpose of evading payment to the seller of the amount of the tax

4 this State of specified digital products purchased and
5 electronically transferred from any retailer on or after January 1,
6 2026, for use in this State at a rate equal to the sum of the rates of
7 all taxes imposed upon the storage, use or other consumption of
8 tangible personal property in the county in which the use of the
9 specified digital products occurs.
10 2. The tax imposed by subsection 1 applies whether the
11 purchaser obtains permanent use or less than permanent use of
12 the specified digital product, whether the sale is conditioned or not
13 conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser and

19 imposed by section 24 of this act was not collected.
20 Sec. 34. Every person storing, using or otherwise consuming
21 in this State specified digital products purchased from a retailer is
22 liable for the tax. The liability of a person pursuant to this section
23 is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to this State, except
24 that a receipt from a retailer given to the purchaser pursuant to
25 section 35 of this act is sufficient to relieve the purchaser from
26 further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers.
27 Sec. 35. Every retailer maintaining a place of business in
28 this State and making sales of specified digital products for use in
29 this State, not exempted by this chapter, shall, at the time of
30 making the sales or, if the use of the specified digital products is
31 not then taxable hereunder, at the time the use becomes taxable,
32 collect the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser a
33 receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Nevada
34 Tax Commission.
