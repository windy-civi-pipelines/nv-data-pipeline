11 deems necessary.
12 Existing law authorizes the court, after the filing of a petition in a guardianship
13 proceeding, to appoint one or more investigators to perform certain duties related to
14 the proceeding. (NRS 159.046, 159A.046) Existing law likewise authorizes an
15 investigator employed by the Office to provide investigative services to the district
16 courts during the administration of guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159.341)
17 Sections 1, 3 and 6 of this bill expand the authority of an investigator appointed by

20 written permission for the investigator to obtain certain information concerning the
21 criminal history of the person; and (2) forward the fingerprints to the Central
22 Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal

25 court, from charging a fee for providing a copy of any document requested by an
26 investigator in connection with an investigation; and (2) make various other
27 changes relating to an investigation.
28 Existing law: (1) authorizes the court in an adult guardianship proceeding to
29 appoint or extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected person or proposed
30 protected person seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile with the United
31 States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland
32 Security under certain circumstances; and (2) provides for the termination of any

42 a guardian and the citation issued pursuant to any such petition on certain persons;
43 and (2) prescribes the procedure for the service of process on such persons. (NRS

45 service of process by authorizing: (1) service by certain methods set forth in the
46 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure under certain circumstances; and (2) the court to

– 2 –
7 Office; and (2) title of the State Guardianship Compliance Officer to the State
8 Guardianship Officer. Section 3 also expands the authority of the Officer to hire
9 accountants and investigators by authorizing the Officer, within the limits of
10 legislative appropriation, to hire such accountants and investigators as the Officer
11 deems necessary.
12 Existing law authorizes the court, after the filing of a petition in a guardianship
13 proceeding, to appoint one or more investigators to perform certain duties related to
14 the proceeding. (NRS 159.046, 159A.046) Existing law likewise authorizes an
15 investigator employed by the Office to provide investigative services to the district
16 courts during the administration of guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159.341)
17 Sections 1, 3 and 6 of this bill expand the authority of an investigator appointed by
18 the court or employed by the Office, as applicable, by authorizing any such

20 written permission for the investigator to obtain certain information concerning the
21 criminal history of the person; and (2) forward the fingerprints to the Central
22 Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal

25 court, from charging a fee for providing a copy of any document requested by an
26 investigator in connection with an investigation; and (2) make various other
27 changes relating to an investigation.
28 Existing law: (1) authorizes the court in an adult guardianship proceeding to
29 appoint or extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected person or proposed
30 protected person seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile with the United
31 States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland
32 Security under certain circumstances; and (2) provides for the termination of any
33 such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected person reaches 21
34 years of age. (NRS 159.191, 159.343) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill likewise: (1)

40 relevant definition of “minor.”
41 Existing law: (1) requires service of a copy of a petition for the appointment of
42 a guardian and the citation issued pursuant to any such petition on certain persons;
43 and (2) prescribes the procedure for the service of process on such persons. (NRS
44 159.0475, 159A.0475) Sections 2 and 7 of this bill revise the procedure for such
45 service of process by authorizing: (1) service by certain methods set forth in the
46 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure under certain circumstances; and (2) the court to
47 waive a requirement that service of the citation be made by publication under
48 certain circumstances.
