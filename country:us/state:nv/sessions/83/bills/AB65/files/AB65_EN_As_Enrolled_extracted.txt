guardianship proceeding; revising provisions relating to
service of process of a citation and petition in a guardianship
proceeding; changing the name of the State Guardianship
Compliance Office to the State Guardianship Office;
changing the title of the State Guardianship Compliance
Officer to the State Guardianship Officer; revising the powers
of the Officer; authorizing a court to appoint or extend the
appointment of a guardian for a protected minor or proposed
protected minor seeking status as a special immigrant
juvenile with the United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services of the Department of Homeland Security under
certain circumstances; revising certain notice requirements
for minor guardianship proceedings; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the State Guardianship Compliance Office to provide
certain services relating to guardianship proceedings. Existing law also: (1) creates
the position of State Guardianship Compliance Officer within the Office; and (2)
authorizes the Officer to hire two accountants and two investigators to provide
certain services to district courts. (NRS 159.341) Section 3 of this bill changes the:
(1) name of the State Guardianship Compliance Office to the State Guardianship
Office; and (2) title of the State Guardianship Compliance Officer to the State
Guardianship Officer. Section 3 also expands the authority of the Officer to hire
accountants and investigators by authorizing the Officer, within the limits of
legislative appropriation, to hire such accountants and investigators as the Officer
deems necessary.
Existing law authorizes the court, after the filing of a petition in a guardianship
proceeding, to appoint one or more investigators to perform certain duties related to
the proceeding. (NRS 159.046, 159A.046) Existing law likewise authorizes an
investigator employed by the Office to provide investigative services to the district
courts during the administration of guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159.341)

Section 2:
Sections 1, 3 and 6 of this bill: (1) prohibit a governmental entity, including a
court, from charging a fee for providing a copy of any document requested by an
investigator in connection with an investigation; and (2) make various other
changes relating to an investigation.
Existing law: (1) authorizes the court in an adult guardianship proceeding to
appoint or extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected person or proposed
protected person seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile with the United
States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland
Security under certain circumstances; and (2) provides for the termination of any
such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected person reaches
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
21 years of age. (NRS 159.191, 159.343) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill likewise: (1)
authorize the court in a minor guardianship proceeding to appoint or extend the
appointment of a guardian for a protected minor or proposed protected minor
seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile; and (2) provide for the termination
of any such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected minor
reaches 21 years of age. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to the
relevant definition of “minor.”
Existing law requires a person who files a petition in a minor guardianship
proceeding to notify the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
of the time and place of the hearing on the petition if the protected minor has
received or is receiving benefits from Medicaid. (NRS 159A.034) Section 5.5 of
this bill eliminates this requirement.
Existing law: (1) requires service of a copy of a petition for the appointment of
a guardian and the citation issued pursuant to any such petition on certain persons;
and (2) prescribes the procedure for the service of process on such persons. (NRS

Section 3:
159.0475, 159A.0475) Sections 2 and 7 of this bill revise the procedure for such
service of process by authorizing: (1) service by certain methods set forth in the
Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure under certain circumstances; and (2) the court to
waive a requirement that service of the citation be made by publication under
certain circumstances.

Assembly Bill No. 65–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to guardianship; revising provisions relating to
certain investigative services provided during a guardianship
proceeding; prohibiting a governmental entity from charging
a fee for providing a copy of certain documents relating to a
guardianship proceeding; revising provisions relating to
service of process of a citation and petition in a guardianship
proceeding; changing the name of the State Guardianship
Compliance Office to the State Guardianship Office;
changing the title of the State Guardianship Compliance
Officer to the State Guardianship Officer; revising the powers
of the Officer; authorizing a court to appoint or extend the
appointment of a guardian for a protected minor or proposed
protected minor seeking status as a special immigrant
juvenile with the United States Citizenship and Immigration
Services of the Department of Homeland Security under
certain circumstances; revising certain notice requirements
for minor guardianship proceedings; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the State Guardianship Compliance Office to provide
certain services relating to guardianship proceedings. Existing law also: (1) creates
the position of State Guardianship Compliance Officer within the Office; and (2)
authorizes the Officer to hire two accountants and two investigators to provide
certain services to district courts. (NRS 159.341) Section 3 of this bill changes the:
(1) name of the State Guardianship Compliance Office to the State Guardianship
Office; and (2) title of the State Guardianship Compliance Officer to the State
Guardianship Officer. Section 3 also expands the authority of the Officer to hire
accountants and investigators by authorizing the Officer, within the limits of
legislative appropriation, to hire such accountants and investigators as the Officer
deems necessary.
Existing law authorizes the court, after the filing of a petition in a guardianship
proceeding, to appoint one or more investigators to perform certain duties related to
the proceeding. (NRS 159.046, 159A.046) Existing law likewise authorizes an
investigator employed by the Office to provide investigative services to the district
courts during the administration of guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159.341)
Sections 1, 3 and 6 of this bill: (1) prohibit a governmental entity, including a
court, from charging a fee for providing a copy of any document requested by an
investigator in connection with an investigation; and (2) make various other
changes relating to an investigation.
Existing law: (1) authorizes the court in an adult guardianship proceeding to
appoint or extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected person or proposed
protected person seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile with the United
States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland
Security under certain circumstances; and (2) provides for the termination of any
such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected person reaches
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
21 years of age. (NRS 159.191, 159.343) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill likewise: (1)
authorize the court in a minor guardianship proceeding to appoint or extend the
appointment of a guardian for a protected minor or proposed protected minor
seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile; and (2) provide for the termination
of any such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected minor
reaches 21 years of age. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to the
relevant definition of “minor.”
Existing law requires a person who files a petition in a minor guardianship
proceeding to notify the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
of the time and place of the hearing on the petition if the protected minor has
received or is receiving benefits from Medicaid. (NRS 159A.034) Section 5.5 of
this bill eliminates this requirement.
Existing law: (1) requires service of a copy of a petition for the appointment of
a guardian and the citation issued pursuant to any such petition on certain persons;
and (2) prescribes the procedure for the service of process on such persons. (NRS
159.0475, 159A.0475) Sections 2 and 7 of this bill revise the procedure for such
service of process by authorizing: (1) service by certain methods set forth in the
Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure under certain circumstances; and (2) the court to
waive a requirement that service of the citation be made by publication under
certain circumstances.
