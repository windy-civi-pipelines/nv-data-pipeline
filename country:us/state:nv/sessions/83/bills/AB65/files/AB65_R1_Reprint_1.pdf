Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Guardianship Compliance Office to provide
2 certain services relating to guardianship proceedings. Existing law also: (1) creates
3 the position of State Guardianship Compliance Officer within the Office; and (2)
4 authorizes the Officer to hire two accountants and two investigators to provide
5 certain services to district courts. (NRS 159.341) Section 3 of this bill changes the:
-
*AB65_R1*

– 2 –
6 (1) name of the State Guardianship Compliance Office to the State Guardianship
7 Office; and (2) title of the State Guardianship Compliance Officer to the State
8 Guardianship Officer. Section 3 also expands the authority of the Officer to hire
9 accountants and investigators by authorizing the Officer, within the limits of
10 legislative appropriation, to hire such accountants and investigators as the Officer
11 deems necessary.
12 Existing law authorizes the court, after the filing of a petition in a guardianship
13 proceeding, to appoint one or more investigators to perform certain duties related to
14 the proceeding. (NRS 159.046, 159A.046) Existing law likewise authorizes an
15 investigator employed by the Office to provide investigative services to the district
16 courts during the administration of guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159.341)
17 Sections 1, 3 and 6 of this bill: (1) prohibit a governmental entity, including a
18 court, from charging a fee for providing a copy of any document requested by an
19 investigator in connection with an investigation; and (2) make various other
20 changes relating to an investigation.
21 Existing law: (1) authorizes the court in an adult guardianship proceeding to
22 appoint or extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected person or proposed
23 protected person seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile with the United
24 States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland
25 Security under certain circumstances; and (2) provides for the termination of any
26 such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected person reaches 21
27 years of age. (NRS 159.191, 159.343) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill likewise: (1)
28 authorize the court in a minor guardianship proceeding to appoint or extend the
29 appointment of a guardian for a protected minor or proposed protected minor
30 seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile; and (2) provide for the termination
31 of any such guardianship on or before the date on which the protected minor
32 reaches 21 years of age. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to the
33 relevant definition of “minor.”
34 Existing law requires a person who files a petition in a minor guardianship
35 proceeding to notify the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
36 of the time and place of the hearing on the petition if the protected minor has
37 received or is receiving benefits from Medicaid. (NRS 159A.034) Section 5.5 of
38 this bill eliminates this requirement.
39 Existing law: (1) requires service of a copy of a petition for the appointment of
40 a guardian and the citation issued pursuant to any such petition on certain persons;
41 and (2) prescribes the procedure for the service of process on such persons. (NRS
42 159.0475, 159A.0475) Sections 2 and 7 of this bill revise the procedure for such
43 service of process by authorizing: (1) service by certain methods set forth in the
44 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure under certain circumstances; and (2) the court to
45 waive a requirement that service of the citation be made by publication under
46 certain circumstances.
