for a protected minor or proposed protected minor seeking status as a
special immigrant juvenile with the United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security under
certain circumstances; revising certain notice requirements for
minor guardianship proceedings; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Guardianship Compliance Office to provide certain services
2 relating to guardianship proceedings. Existing law also: (1) creates the position of State
3 Guardianship Compliance Officer within the Office; and (2) authorizes the Officer to hire two
4 accountants and two investigators to provide certain services to district courts. (NRS 159.341)
5 Section 3 of this bill changes the: (1) name of the State Guardianship Compliance Office to
6 the State Guardianship Office; and (2) title of the State Guardianship Compliance Officer to
7 the State Guardianship Officer. Section 3 also expands the authority of the Officer to hire
8 accountants and investigators by authorizing the Officer, within the limits of legislative
9 appropriation, to hire such accountants and investigators as the Officer deems necessary.
10 Existing law authorizes the court, after the filing of a petition in a guardianship
11 proceeding, to appoint one or more investigators to perform certain duties related to the
12 proceeding. (NRS 159.046, 159A.046) Existing law likewise authorizes an investigator
13 employed by the Office to provide investigative services to the district courts during the
14 administration of guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159.341) [Sections 1, 3 and 6 of this bill

Assembly Amendment No. 394 to Assembly Bill No. 65 Page 4
15 expand the authority of an investigator appointed by the court or employed by the Office, as
16 applicable, by authorizing any such investigator to: (1) obtain a complete set of the
17 fingerprints of certain persons and written permission for the investigator to obtain certain
18 information concerning the criminal history of the person; and (2) forward the fingerprints to
19 the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal
20 history of the person and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its report.]
21 Sections 1, 3 and 6 [also:] of this bill: (1) prohibit a governmental entity, including a court,
22 from charging a fee for providing a copy of any document requested by an investigator in
23 connection with an investigation; and (2) make various other changes relating to an
24 investigation.
25 Existing law: (1) authorizes the court in an adult guardianship proceeding to appoint or
26 extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected person or proposed protected person
27 seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile with the United States Citizenship and
28 Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security under certain circumstances;
29 and (2) provides for the termination of any such guardianship on or before the date on which
30 the protected person reaches 21 years of age. (NRS 159.191, 159.343) Sections 4 and 8 of
31 this bill likewise: (1) authorize the court in a minor guardianship proceeding to appoint or
32 extend the appointment of a guardian for a protected minor or proposed protected minor
33 seeking status as a special immigrant juvenile; and (2) provide for the termination of any such
34 guardianship on or before the date on which the protected minor reaches 21 years of age.
35 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to the relevant definition of “minor.”
36 Existing law requires a person who files a petition in a minor guardianship
37 proceeding to notify the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services of
38 the time and place of the hearing on the petition if the protected minor has received or is
39 receiving benefits from Medicaid. (NRS 159A.034) Section 5.5 of this bill eliminates this
40 requirement.
41 Existing law: (1) requires service of a copy of a petition for the appointment of a guardian
42 and the citation issued pursuant to any such petition on certain persons; and (2) prescribes the
43 procedure for the service of process on such persons. (NRS 159.0475, 159A.0475) Sections 2
44 and 7 of this bill revise the procedure for such service of process by authorizing: (1) service
45 by certain methods set forth in the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure under certain
46 circumstances; and (2) the court to waive a requirement that service of the citation be made by
47 publication under certain circumstances.
