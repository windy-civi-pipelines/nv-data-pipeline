AN ACT relating to electronic filing; revising provisions relating to
the signing of certain documents that are filed
electronically; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes the electronic filing of certain documents in certain
2 judicial proceedings; and (2) requires documents that are filed electronically to
3 contain an image of the signature of the person who is filing the document. (NRS
4 62D.400, 171.103, 173.049, 178.591, 432B.515) Existing court rules adopted by
5 the Nevada Supreme Court, the Nevada Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules
6 (NEFCR), govern the electronic filing of documents in the courts of this State and
7 contain definitions of certain terms used in the NEFCR such as “electronic
8 signature.” (NEFCR 2(k)) This bill requires certain documents that are filed
9 electronically to contain the electronic signature, as that term is defined in the
10 NEFCR, of the person who is filing the document.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
