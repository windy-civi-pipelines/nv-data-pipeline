Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to electronic filing; revising provisions relating to
the signing of certain documents that are filed electronically;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) authorizes the electronic filing of certain documents in certain
judicial proceedings; and (2) requires documents that are filed electronically to
contain an image of the signature of the person who is filing the document. (NRS
62D.400, 171.103, 173.049, 178.591, 432B.515) Existing court rules adopted by
the Nevada Supreme Court, the Nevada Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules
(NEFCR), govern the electronic filing of documents in the courts of this State and
contain definitions of certain terms used in the NEFCR such as “electronic
signature.” (NEFCR 2(k)) This bill requires certain documents that are filed
electronically to contain the electronic signature, as that term is defined in the
NEFCR, of the person who is filing the document.
