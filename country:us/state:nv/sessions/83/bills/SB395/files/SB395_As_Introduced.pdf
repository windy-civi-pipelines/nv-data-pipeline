AN ACT relating to autonomous vehicles; revising requirements for
a human operator to be present in an autonomous vehicle
during operation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations
2 authorizing the operation of autonomous vehicles on highways within this State.
3 (NRS 482A.100) Under existing law, an “autonomous vehicle” is a motor vehicle
4 that is equipped with an automated driving system which is designed to function at
5 certain levels of driving automation, including, without limitation, fully
6 autonomous vehicles. (NRS 482A.030) Existing law generally prohibits the testing
7 or operation of an autonomous vehicle on a highway within this State unless a
8 human operator is present in the vehicle and is capable of taking over immediate
9 manual control of the vehicle under certain circumstances. (NRS 482A.070)
10 However, such a human operator is not required for the testing or operation of a
11 fully autonomous vehicle on a highway within this State if the vehicle is capable of
12 achieving a minimal risk condition upon a failure of its automated driving system.
13 (NRS 482A.070, 482A.080) Existing law authorizes the Department to impose an
14 administrative fine, not to exceed $2,500, for a violation of any provision of
15 existing law governing the testing or operation of autonomous vehicles on a
16 highway within this State. (NRS 482A.220)
17 Section 1 of this bill: (1) prohibits an autonomous vehicle with a gross vehicle
18 weight rating or combined gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 26,000 pounds
19 from being tested or operated on a highway within this State unless a human
20 operator who holds a commercial driver’s license and is trained in operating and
21 shutting off the vehicle is present in the vehicle and is capable of taking over
22 immediate manual control of the vehicle under certain circumstances; and (2)
23 similarly prohibits an autonomous vehicle with more than two axles and that is
24 capable of transporting eight passengers or more from being operated on a highway
25 within this State unless a human operator who holds a commercial driver’s license

26 and is trained in operating and shutting off the vehicle is present in the vehicle and
27 is capable of taking over immediate manual control of the vehicle under certain
28 circumstances. Under section 1, the human operator holding the commercial
29 driver’s license is required to comply with all federal and state qualifications for the
30 type of vehicle being operated, whether in automated or nonautomated mode.
31 Section 2 of this bill provides the provisions of section 1 become effective on
32 October 1, 2025, and expire by limitation on September 30, 2035.
