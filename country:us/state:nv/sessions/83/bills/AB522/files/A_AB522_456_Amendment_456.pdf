AN ACT relating to health care; requiring health insurers to allow the covered adult

actions; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires all health insurers to extend coverage for the covered adult
2 child of an insured until such child reaches 26 years of age. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-14) Sections
3 2, 17, 31, 44, 46, 60, 74, 79, 90, 104 and 106 of this bill align Nevada law with federal law in
4 this manner and require a policy of health insurance that provides coverage for dependent
5 children to continue to make such coverage available until the dependent child reaches 26
6 years of age.
7 Existing federal law requires all health insurance plans to include coverage, without a
8 higher deductible, copay or coinsurance, for certain preventive health care for women, adults
9 and children based on the recommendations and guidelines of certain entities, including the
10 United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Health Resources and Services
11 Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (42 U.S.C. §
12 300gg-13; 45 C.F.R. § 147.130) Existing Nevada law generally conforms with federal law in
13 this manner and requires public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid,
14 to cover certain preventive health care, including certain screenings, counseling, vaccinations
15 and contraceptive and other family planning drugs and devices. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
16 422.27172, 422.27174, 608.1555, 689A.0418, 689A.0419, 689B.0378, 689B.03785,
17 689C.1676, 689C.1678, 695A.1865, 695A.1875, 695B.1919, 695B.19195, 695C.1696,
18 695C.1698, 695G.1715, 695G.1717) Sections 3-5, 11, 18-20, 27, 32-34, 40, 44, 47-49, 57, 61-

Assembly Amendment No. 456 to Assembly Bill No. 522 Page 4
19 63, 69, 75-77, 79, 80, 91-93, 101, 104, 106 and 115 of this bill require public and private
20 policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, to include certain additional preventive
21 health care services which are not currently required to be covered under existing law, but
22 have been recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Health
23 Resources and Services Administration. Sections 3-5, 11, 18-20, 27, 32-34, 40, 44, 47-49, 57,
24 61-63, 69, 75-77, 79, 80, 91-93, 101, 104, 106 , [and] 115 and 117 additionally prohibit an
25 insurer from charging a higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for such preventive
26 health care.
27 Existing law requires certain public and private policies of health insurance to provide
28 coverage for: (1) screening, genetic counseling and testing for harmful mutations in the BRCA
29 gene under certain circumstances; (2) examinations of persons who are pregnant to detect
30 certain diseases; and (3) testing for, treating and preventing sexually transmitted diseases.
31 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173, 422.27175, 608.1555, 689A.04049, 689A.0412,
32 689A.0438, 689B.0314, 689B.0315, 689B.0316, 689C.1653, 689C.1673, 689C.1675,
33 695A.1844, 695A.1853, 695A.1856, 695B.1911, 695B.1913, 695B.1926, 695C.17347,
34 695C.1736, 695C.1737, 695G.1707, 695G.1712, 695G.1714) Sections 8, 10, 13, 21-23, 36,
35 37, 39, 52, 53, 55, 66, 68, 70, 83, 85, 86, 96, 97, 99, 114 and 116 of this bill prohibit an
36 insurer from charging a higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for these services as
37 well. Sections 10, 22, 39, 55, 68, 86, 99 and 114 additionally require such policies of health
38 insurance to include coverage for the detection of the human immunodeficiency virus in
39 persons who are pregnant.
40 Existing law requires certain public and private policies of health insurance to include
41 coverage for certain screenings and tests for breast cancer. Existing law also prohibits such
42 policies of health insurance, other than Medicaid, from charging a higher deductible or any
43 copay or coinsurance for such screenings and tests. (NRS 287.0273, 287.04337, 422.27176,
44 608.1555, 689A.0405, 689B.0374, 689C.1674, 695A.1855, 695B.1912, 695C.1735,
45 695G.1713) [Sections 9, 25, 38, 54, 67, 84, 98, 105, 107 and 117 of this bill additionally
46 require such policies of health insurance to include coverage for medication to prevent breast
47 cancer for insureds who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer. Sections 9, 25, 38, 54,
48 67, 84, 98, 105, 107 and 117 also prohibit an insurer from charging a higher deductible or any
49 copay or coinsurance for any of these services.] Sections 105 and 107 of this bill additionally
50 require insurance for government employees to cover certain additional diagnostic imaging if
51 breast cancer is seen or suspected [.] without charging a higher deductible or imposing any
52 copay or coinsurance for such imaging.
53 Existing law requires certain policies of health insurance that provide coverage for the
54 treatment of colorectal cancer to additionally provide coverage for the screening of colorectal
55 cancer. (NRS 689A.04042, 689B.0367, 695B.1907, 695C.1731, 695G.168) Sections 7, 24,
56 35, 50, 65, 82, 95 and 111 of this bill: (1) require all public and private policies of health
57 insurance, including Medicaid, to cover screening for colorectal cancer; and (2) prohibit
58 insurers from charging a higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for such screenings.
59 Existing federal law requires all policies of health insurance to include coverage for
60 maternity and newborn care. (42 U.S.C. § 18022(b)) Sections 12, 15, [26,] 29, 41, 42, 51, 56,
61 64, 71, 78, 81, 94, 100 and 112 of this bill align Nevada law with federal law in this manner
62 and require public and private policies of health insurance to include coverage for such care.
63 Existing federal regulations prohibit certain health care entities from discriminating on
64 the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§ 92.101, 92.206,
65 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits public and private policies of health insurance from
66 discriminating against any person with respect to participation or coverage under the policy on
67 the basis of actual or perceived gender identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
68 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033, 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167,
69 695C.050, 695C.204, 695G.415) Sections 6, 28, 43, 58, 72, 87, 102 and 113 of this bill
70 additionally prohibit public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, from
71 discriminating against any person on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national
72 origin, sex, age or disability. Section 119 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider of health
73 care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those characteristics, as well as
74 gender identity or expression. Section 119 also authorizes a board, agency or other entity in
75 this State that licenses, certifies or regulates a provider of health care to: (1) adopt regulations
76 prescribing the types of discrimination that are prohibited; and (2) discipline a provider of
77 health care that violates section 119.

Assembly Amendment No. 456 to Assembly Bill No. 522 Page 5
78 Existing law prohibits an insurer that offers or issues a policy of group health
79 insurance from penalizing a provider of health care who provides the following benefits
80 that such an insurer is required to cover: (1) certain counseling and screenings; (2)
81 smoking cessation programs; (3) certain federally recommended vaccinations; (4)
82 federally recommended well-woman preventative visits; and (5) care in a hospital for a
83 prescribed length of time after a birth. (NRS 689B.03785, 689B.520) Sections 27 and 29
84 remove that prohibition, thereby authorizing such an insurer to penalize a provider of
85 health care for providing such benefits and the additional benefits added by those
86 sections. Section 104 exempts health plans for retirees from local government
87 employment from: (1) the requirements of this bill; and (2) certain provisions of existing
88 law requiring group health insurance plans to provide certain coverage and prohibiting
89 such plans from engaging in certain discrimination. (NRS 689B.0314, 689B.0315,
90 689B.0316, 689B.0367 and 689B.0675)
91 Section 88 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or revoke the
92 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage required by
93 sections 74-78. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other
94 private health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by this bill. (NRS 680A.200)
95 Section 103 of this bill requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
96 to administer the provisions of sections 109-112 in the same manner as other provisions
97 relating to Medicaid.
