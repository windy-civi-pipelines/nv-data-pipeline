67 insurance to include coverage for such care.
68 Existing federal regulations prohibit certain health care entities from
69 discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45
70 C.F.R. §§ 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits public and private
71 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
72 participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
73 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,

3 U.S.C. § 300gg-14) Sections 2, 17, 31, 44, 46, 60, 74, 79, 90, 104 and 106 of this

12 of Health and Human Services. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13; 45 C.F.R. § 147.130)
13 Existing Nevada law generally conforms with federal law in this manner and
14 requires public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, to
15 cover certain preventive health care, including certain screenings, counseling,
16 vaccinations and contraceptive and other family planning drugs and devices. (NRS
17 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172, 422.27174, 608.1555, 689A.0418, 689A.0419,

20 Sections 3-5, 11, 18-20, 27, 32-34, 40, 44, 47-49, 57, 61-63, 69, 75-77, 79, 80, 91-
21 93, 101, 104, 106 and 115 of this bill require public and private policies of health
22 insurance, including Medicaid, to include certain additional preventive health care
23 services which are not currently required to be covered under existing law, but have
24 been recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the
25 Health Resources and Services Administration. Sections 3-5, 11, 18-20, 27, 32-34,
26 40, 44, 47-49, 57, 61-63, 69, 75-77, 79, 80, 91-93, 101, 104, 106 and 115

43 Existing law requires certain public and private policies of health insurance to
44 include coverage for certain screenings and tests for breast cancer. Existing law
45 also prohibits such policies of health insurance, other than Medicaid, from charging
46 a higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for such screenings and tests.
47 (NRS 287.0273, 287.04337, 422.27176, 608.1555, 689A.0405, 689B.0374,
48 689C.1674, 695A.1855, 695B.1912, 695C.1735, 695G.1713) Sections 9, 25, 38,
49 54, 67, 84, 98, 105, 107 and 117 of this bill additionally require such policies of
50 health insurance to include coverage for medication to prevent breast cancer for
51 insureds who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer. Sections 9, 25, 38, 54,
52 67, 84, 98, 105, 107 and 117 also prohibit an insurer from charging a higher
53 deductible or any copay or coinsurance for any of these services. Sections 105 and
54 107 additionally require insurance for government employees to cover certain
55 additional diagnostic imaging if breast cancer is seen or suspected.
56 Existing law requires certain policies of health insurance that provide coverage
57 for the treatment of colorectal cancer to additionally provide coverage for the
58 screening of colorectal cancer. (NRS 689A.04042, 689B.0367, 695B.1907,
59 695C.1731, 695G.168) Sections 7, 24, 35, 50, 65, 82, 95 and 111 of this bill: (1)

61 cover screening for colorectal cancer; and (2) prohibit insurers from charging a
62 higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for such screenings.

– 3 –
65 26, 29, 41, 42, 51, 56, 64, 71, 78, 81, 94, 100 and 112 of this bill align Nevada law
66 with federal law in this manner and require public and private policies of health
67 insurance to include coverage for such care.
68 Existing federal regulations prohibit certain health care entities from
69 discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45
70 C.F.R. §§ 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits public and private
71 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
72 participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
73 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
74 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
75 695G.415) Sections 6, 28, 43, 58, 72, 87, 102 and 113 of this bill additionally
76 prohibit public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, from
77 discriminating against any person on the basis of actual or perceived race, color,
78 national origin, sex, age or disability. Section 119 of this bill similarly prohibits a
79 provider of health care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those
80 characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression. Section 119 also authorizes
81 a board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates a
82 provider of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the types of
83 discrimination that are prohibited; and (2) discipline a provider of health care that
84 violates section 119.
85 Section 88 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
86 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
87 coverage required by sections 74-78. The Commissioner would also be authorized
88 to take such action against other private health insurers who fail to provide the
89 coverage required by this bill. (NRS 680A.200) Section 103 of this bill requires
90 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
91 provisions of sections 109-112 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
92 Medicaid.
