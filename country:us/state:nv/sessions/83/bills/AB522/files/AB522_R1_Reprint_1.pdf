4 bill align Nevada law with federal law in this manner and require a policy of health

11 the Health Resources and Services Administration of the United States Department
12 of Health and Human Services. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13; 45 C.F.R. § 147.130)
13 Existing Nevada law generally conforms with federal law in this manner and
14 requires public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, to
15 cover certain preventive health care, including certain screenings, counseling,
16 vaccinations and contraceptive and other family planning drugs and devices. (NRS
17 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172, 422.27174, 608.1555, 689A.0418, 689A.0419,

20 Sections 3-5, 11, 18-20, 27, 32-34, 40, 44, 47-49, 57, 61-63, 69, 75-77, 79, 80, 91-
21 93, 101, 104, 106 and 115 of this bill require public and private policies of health
22 insurance, including Medicaid, to include certain additional preventive health care
23 services which are not currently required to be covered under existing law, but have
24 been recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the
25 Health Resources and Services Administration. Sections 3-5, 11, 18-20, 27, 32-34,
26 40, 44, 47-49, 57, 61-63, 69, 75-77, 79, 80, 91-93, 101, 104, 106, 115 and 117

31 mutations in the BRCA gene under certain circumstances; (2) examinations of
32 persons who are pregnant to detect certain diseases; and (3) testing for, treating and

41 additionally require such policies of health insurance to include coverage for the
42 detection of the human immunodeficiency virus in persons who are pregnant.
43 Existing law requires certain public and private policies of health insurance to
44 include coverage for certain screenings and tests for breast cancer. Existing law
45 also prohibits such policies of health insurance, other than Medicaid, from charging
46 a higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for such screenings and tests.
47 (NRS 287.0273, 287.04337, 422.27176, 608.1555, 689A.0405, 689B.0374,
48 689C.1674, 695A.1855, 695B.1912, 695C.1735, 695G.1713) Sections 105 and
49 107 of this bill additionally require insurance for government employees to cover
50 certain additional diagnostic imaging if breast cancer is seen or suspected without
51 charging a higher deductible or imposing any copay or coinsurance for such
52 imaging.
53 Existing law requires certain policies of health insurance that provide coverage
54 for the treatment of colorectal cancer to additionally provide coverage for the
55 screening of colorectal cancer. (NRS 689A.04042, 689B.0367, 695B.1907,
56 695C.1731, 695G.168) Sections 7, 24, 35, 50, 65, 82, 95 and 111 of this bill: (1)
57 require all public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, to
58 cover screening for colorectal cancer; and (2) prohibit insurers from charging a
59 higher deductible or any copay or coinsurance for such screenings.
60 Existing federal law requires all policies of health insurance to include
61 coverage for maternity and newborn care. (42 U.S.C. § 18022(b)) Sections 12, 15,
62 29, 41, 42, 51, 56, 64, 71, 78, 81, 94, 100 and 112 of this bill align Nevada law
63 with federal law in this manner and require public and private policies of health
64 insurance to include coverage for such care.

65 Existing federal regulations prohibit certain health care entities from
66 discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45
67 C.F.R. §§ 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits public and private
68 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
69 participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
70 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
71 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
72 695G.415) Sections 6, 28, 43, 58, 72, 87, 102 and 113 of this bill additionally
73 prohibit public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, from
74 discriminating against any person on the basis of actual or perceived race, color,
75 national origin, sex, age or disability. Section 119 of this bill similarly prohibits a
76 provider of health care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those
77 characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression. Section 119 also authorizes
78 a board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates a
79 provider of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the types of
80 discrimination that are prohibited; and (2) discipline a provider of health care that
81 violates section 119.
82 Existing law prohibits an insurer that offers or issues a policy of group health
83 insurance from penalizing a provider of health care who provides the following
84 benefits that such an insurer is required to cover: (1) certain counseling and
85 screenings; (2) smoking cessation programs; (3) certain federally recommended
86 vaccinations; (4) federally recommended well-woman preventative visits; and (5)
87 care in a hospital for a prescribed length of time after a birth. (NRS 689B.03785,
88 689B.520) Sections 27 and 29 remove that prohibition, thereby authorizing such an
89 insurer to penalize a provider of health care for providing such benefits and the
90 additional benefits added by those sections. Section 104 exempts health plans for
91 retirees from local government employment from: (1) the requirements of this bill;
92 and (2) certain provisions of existing law requiring group health insurance plans to
93 provide certain coverage and prohibiting such plans from engaging in certain
94 discrimination. (NRS 689B.0314, 689B.0315, 689B.0316, 689B.0367 and
95 689B.0675)
96 Section 88 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to suspend or
97 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the
98 coverage required by sections 74-78. The Commissioner would also be authorized
99 to take such action against other private health insurers who fail to provide the
100 coverage required by this bill. (NRS 680A.200) Section 103 of this bill requires
101 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
102 provisions of sections 109-112 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
103 Medicaid.

41 the minimum protection available pursuant to this section;
42 (c) [Penalize, or otherwise reduce or limit, the reimbursement of
