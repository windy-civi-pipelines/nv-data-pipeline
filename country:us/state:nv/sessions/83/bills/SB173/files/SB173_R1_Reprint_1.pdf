Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from
2 facilitating an online food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless
3 the food delivery service platform provider has entered into a written agreement
4 with the food dispensing establishment. (NRS 597.7635) Section 2 of this bill
5 requires a food delivery service platform provider to provide a user with the option
6 to request to receive disposable foodware accessories or standard condiments from
7 the food dispensing establishment with his or her order. Section 2 also prohibits a
8 food dispensing establishment that has a written agreement with a food delivery
9 service platform provider from: (1) providing disposable foodware accessories or
10 standard condiments with an order unless requested by the user; and (2) packaging
11 or bundling disposable foodware accessories or standard condiments for single use
12 in a manner that prevents the user from receiving only the disposable foodware
13 accessory or standard condiments that the user requested. Section 27 of this bill
14 makes a conforming change to indicate the placement of section 2 and applies
15 certain existing definitions relating to food delivery service platform providers to
16 section 2. Section 28 of this bill provides that a violation of section 2 shall be
17 deemed a deceptive trade practice and is subject to certain existing civil and
18 criminal penalties.
19 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, the discharge, use or release of
20 any Class B firefighting foam that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
21 polyfluoroalkyl substances for the purpose of testing the Class B firefighting foam
22 or firefighting training. (NRS 459.682) Beginning on January 1, 2026, section 24
23 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer from selling, offering
24 for sale, distributing for sale or distributing for use any carpet or rug, fabric
25 treatment, food packaging, juvenile product, cosmetic, indoor textile furnishing or
26 indoor upholstered furniture that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
27 polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 24 also authorizes a manufacturer of such
28 products to include a sticker on the product label that states “NO PFAS” to inform
29 the consumer that the product does not contain intentionally added perfluoroalkyl
30 and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
31 Section 25 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer of
32 cookware sold in this State that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
33 polyfluoroalkyl substances to list those substances on the product label of the
34 cookware and on any product listing for online sales: (1) that the product contains
35 intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; and (2) an
36 Internet address and QR code for a website that contains certain information about
37 the intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 25
38 also authorizes a manufacturer of cookware that does not contain intentionally
39 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to include a sticker on the
40 product label that states “NO PFAS” to inform the consumer that the product does
41 not contain intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
42 Sections 6-22 of this bill define certain terms related to such substances.
43 Section 26 of this bill provides that a person who willfully and knowingly
44 violates the provisions of section 24 or 25 is subject to a civil penalty of not more
45 than $1,000 for each violation.
46 Section 23 of this bill provides an exception to the requirements and
47 prohibitions set forth in sections 5-26 of this bill to the extent that such provisions
48 are preempted by or conflict with federal law.
49 Existing law requires a redevelopment plan that contains a provision requiring
50 that taxes be levied upon taxable property in the respective redevelopment area to
51 allocate certain excess amounts of the levied taxes to pay the costs of
52 redevelopment and certain debts relating to redevelopment. (NRS 279.676)
53 Existing law further requires that a certain percentage of such allocated revenue be
54 set aside for certain purposes relating to: (1) affordable housing; and (2) public
55 educational facilities, activities and programs. (NRS 279.685, 279.6855) Section 29
-
*SB173_R1*

– 3 –
56 of this bill provides that the existence of heat islands in a redevelopment area may
57 be considered blight. Section 29 requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) set aside 1
58 percent of such allocated revenue received on or after October 1, 2025, to increase,
59 improve or enhance landscaping in existing neighborhoods to provide shade and
60 reduce heat island effects in such neighborhoods; and (2) perform certain actions
61 relating to heat mitigation. Section 29 also requires the redevelopment agency to
62 prepare and submit a report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
63 transmission to the Legislative Commission or the Legislature, as appropriate,
64 regarding the amount of such money expended for those purposes. Section 30 of
65 this bill provides that the requirements of section 29 are an exception to the
66 requirement that all such excess allocated revenue be pledged for the payment of
67 the principal and interest on loans, advances and indebtedness relating to
68 redevelopment. Section 31 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the
69 placement of section 29 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
70 Section 37 of this bill requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) partner with
71 certain organizations to identify drought tolerant trees to plant pursuant to the
72 requirements of section 29; and (2) contract with an arborist or the Cooperative
73 Extension Service of the University of Nevada, Reno, to identify and purchase tree
74 seedlings for planting pursuant to the requirements of section 29.
75 Existing law requires the Division of Emergency Management within the
76 Office of the Military to adopt regulations setting forth the manner in which federal
77 funds received by the Division to finance projects related to emergency
78 management and homeland security are allocated. (NRS 414.040) Section 32 of
79 this bill requires the Division to, where appropriate and applicable, apply for grants
80 of money from the Federal Government or other sources to reduce heat island
81 effects where such heat island effects threaten the health and safety of the residents
82 of this State and may result in or worsen an emergency or disaster.
83 Existing law authorizes the Governor to prepare a state emergency management
84 plan and requires the Chief of the Division to foster the adoption of plans for
85 emergency operations. (NRS 414.040, 414.060) Existing law requires such plans to
86 be developed and executed in collaboration with persons and organizations that
87 advocate for the needs of victims of emergencies and disasters. (NRS 414.093)
88 Section 33 of this bill requires such plans to include plans for mitigating any severe
89 heat experienced by the victims of emergencies or disasters.
90 Existing law establishes certain requirements for food establishments. (Chapter
91 446 of NRS) Section 33.3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a food establishment from using
92 a plastic cutting board to prepare food in the food establishment; and (2) provides
93 for certain escalating administrative fines for a violation of this prohibition. Section
94 33.7 of this bill provides that these administrative fines are an exception to certain
95 criminal penalties relating to food establishments.
96 Existing law creates the State Board of Cosmetology and requires the Board to
97 oversee applicants for a license and persons licensed in cosmetology, schools of
98 cosmetology, cosmetological establishments and facilities in which threading is
99 conducted. (NRS 644A.200, 644A.250) Section 34 of this bill requires, in any
100 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County), the Board to
101 collect and test random samples sold or offered for sale at retail stores in the county
102 of: (1) hair products to determine whether the hair products contain formaldehyde;
103 and (2) braid hair, weaves and extensions to determine if the items contain known
104 carcinogens. Section 34 authorizes the Board to contract or enter into a
105 memorandum of understanding with a testing laboratory to conduct such testing.
106 Section 35 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada Center for Applied
107 Research of the University of Nevada, Reno, to develop a scientific test to
108 determine whether packaged synthetic hair braids contain formaldehyde and to
109 purchase any necessary equipment and equipment warranties.
