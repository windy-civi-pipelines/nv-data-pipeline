Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from facilitating an
2 online food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless the food delivery service
3 platform provider has entered into a written agreement with the food dispensing
4 establishment. (NRS 597.7635) Section 2 of this bill requires a food delivery service platform
5 provider to provide a user with the option to request to receive disposable foodware
6 accessories or standard condiments from the food dispensing establishment with his or her
7 order. Section 2 also prohibits a food dispensing establishment that has a written agreement
8 with a food delivery service platform provider from: (1) providing disposable foodware
9 accessories or standard condiments with an order unless requested by the user; and (2)
10 packaging or bundling disposable foodware accessories or standard condiments for single use
11 in a manner that prevents the user from receiving only the disposable foodware accessory or
Assembly Amendment No. 955 to Senate Bill No. 173 Second Reprint Page 4
12 standard condiments that the user requested. Section 27 of this bill makes a conforming
13 change to indicate the placement of section 2 and applies certain existing definitions relating
14 to food delivery service platform providers to section 2. Section 28 of this bill provides that a
15 violation of section 2 shall be deemed a deceptive trade practice and is subject to certain
16 existing civil and criminal penalties.
17 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, the discharge, use or release of any Class
18 B firefighting foam that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
19 substances for the purpose of testing the Class B firefighting foam or firefighting training.
20 (NRS 459.682) Beginning on January 1, 2026, section 24 of this bill prohibits, with certain
21 exceptions, a manufacturer from selling, offering for sale, distributing for sale or distributing
22 for use any carpet or rug, fabric treatment, food packaging, juvenile product, cosmetic, indoor
23 textile furnishing or indoor upholstered furniture that contains intentionally added
24 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 24 also authorizes a manufacturer of
25 such products to include a sticker on the product label that states “NO PFAS” to inform the
26 consumer that the product does not contain intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
27 polyfluoroalkyl substances.
28 Section 25 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer of cookware sold
29 in this State that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to
30 list those substances on the product label of the cookware and on any product listing for online
31 sales: (1) that the product contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
32 substances; and (2) an Internet address and QR code for a website that contains certain
33 information about the intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
34 Section 25 also authorizes a manufacturer of cookware that does not contain intentionally
35 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to include a sticker on the product label
36 that states “NO PFAS” to inform the consumer that the product does not contain intentionally
37 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Sections 6-22 of this bill define certain
38 terms related to such substances.
39 Section 26 of this bill provides that a person who willfully and knowingly violates the
40 provisions of section 24 or 25 is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each
41 violation.
42 Section 23 of this bill provides an exception to the requirements and prohibitions set forth
43 in sections 5-26 of this bill to the extent that such provisions are preempted by or conflict with
44 federal law.
45 Existing law requires a redevelopment plan that contains a provision requiring that taxes
46 be levied upon taxable property in the respective redevelopment area to allocate certain excess
47 amounts of the levied taxes to pay the costs of redevelopment and certain debts relating to
48 redevelopment. (NRS 279.676) Existing law further requires that a certain percentage of such
49 allocated revenue be set aside for certain purposes relating to: (1) affordable housing; and (2)
50 public educational facilities, activities and programs. (NRS 279.685, 279.6855) Section 29 of
51 this bill provides that the existence of heat islands in a redevelopment area may be considered
52 blight. Section 29 requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) set aside 1 percent of such
53 allocated revenue received on or after October 1, 2025, to increase, improve or enhance
54 landscaping in existing neighborhoods to provide shade and reduce heat island effects in such
55 neighborhoods; and (2) perform certain actions relating to heat mitigation. Section 29 also
56 requires the redevelopment agency to prepare and submit a report to the Director of the
57 Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
58 Government Affairs or the Legislature, as appropriate, regarding the amount of such money
59 expended for those purposes and present the results of the report and any updates to certain
60 standing committees of the Legislature. Section 30 of this bill provides that the requirements
61 of section 29 are an exception to the requirement that all such excess allocated revenue be
62 pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on loans, advances and indebtedness
63 relating to redevelopment. Section 31 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the
64 placement of section 29 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
65 Section 37 of this bill requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) partner with certain
66 organizations to identify drought tolerant trees to plant pursuant to the requirements of section
67 29; and (2) contract with an arborist or the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of
68 Nevada, Reno, to identify and purchase tree seedlings for planting pursuant to the
69 requirements of section 29.
Assembly Amendment No. 955 to Senate Bill No. 173 Second Reprint Page 5
70 Existing law requires the Division of Emergency Management within the Office of the
71 Military to adopt regulations setting forth the manner in which federal funds received by the
72 Division to finance projects related to emergency management and homeland security are
73 allocated. (NRS 414.040) Section 32 of this bill requires the Division to, where appropriate
74 and applicable, apply for grants of money from the Federal Government or other sources to
75 reduce heat island effects where such heat island effects threaten the health and safety of the
76 residents of this State and may result in or worsen an emergency or disaster.
77 Existing law authorizes the Governor to prepare a state emergency management plan and
78 requires the Chief of the Division to foster the adoption of plans for emergency operations.
79 (NRS 414.040, 414.060) Existing law requires such plans to be developed and executed in
80 collaboration with persons and organizations that advocate for the needs of victims of
81 emergencies and disasters. (NRS 414.093) Section 33 of this bill requires such plans to
82 include plans for mitigating any severe heat experienced by the victims of emergencies or
83 disasters.
84 Existing law establishes certain requirements for food establishments. (Chapter 446 of
85 NRS) Section 33.3 of this bill: (1) requires a food establishment to ensure that each food-
86 contact surface in the food establishment is maintained in good repair and free from excessive
87 wear; (2) requires a health authority to visually inspect the condition and sanitation of all
88 food-contact surfaces during routine inspections of a food establishment; and (3) authorizes a
89 health authority to adopt certain requirements or protocols relating to the inspection of food-
90 contact surfaces.
91 Existing law creates the State Board of Cosmetology and requires the Board to oversee
92 applicants for a license and persons licensed in cosmetology, schools of cosmetology,
93 cosmetological establishments and facilities in which threading is conducted. (NRS 644A.200,
94 644A.250) Section 34 of this bill requires, in any county whose population is 700,000 or more
95 (currently Clark County), the Board to collect and test random samples sold or offered for sale
96 at retail stores in the county of: (1) hair products to determine whether the hair products
97 contain formaldehyde; and (2) braid hair, weaves and extensions to determine if the items
98 contain known carcinogens. Section 34 authorizes the Board to contract or enter into a
99 memorandum of understanding with a testing laboratory to conduct such testing.
100 Section 35 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada Center for Applied Research
101 of the University of Nevada, Reno, to develop a scientific test to determine whether packaged
102 synthetic hair braids contain formaldehyde and to purchase any necessary equipment and
103 equipment warranties.
104 Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Board to enter into a memorandum of understanding
105 with the Nevada System of Higher Education, on behalf of the Nevada Center for Applied
106 Research, relating to the testing required by section 34. Section 36 also requires that, if the
107 Board enters into such a memorandum of understanding, the Board must submit a

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from facilitating an
2 online food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless the food delivery service
3 platform provider has entered into a written agreement with the food dispensing
4 establishment. (NRS 597.7635) Section 2 of this bill requires a food delivery service platform
5 provider to provide a user with the option to request to receive disposable foodware
6 accessories or standard condiments from the food dispensing establishment with his or her
7 order. Section 2 also prohibits a food dispensing establishment that has a written agreement
8 with a food delivery service platform provider from: (1) providing disposable foodware
9 accessories or standard condiments with an order unless requested by the user; and (2)
10 packaging or bundling disposable foodware accessories or standard condiments for single use
11 in a manner that prevents the user from receiving only the disposable foodware accessory or

Assembly Amendment No. 955 to Senate Bill No. 173 Second Reprint Page 4
12 standard condiments that the user requested. Section 27 of this bill makes a conforming
13 change to indicate the placement of section 2 and applies certain existing definitions relating
14 to food delivery service platform providers to section 2. Section 28 of this bill provides that a
15 violation of section 2 shall be deemed a deceptive trade practice and is subject to certain
16 existing civil and criminal penalties.
17 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, the discharge, use or release of any Class
18 B firefighting foam that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
19 substances for the purpose of testing the Class B firefighting foam or firefighting training.
20 (NRS 459.682) Beginning on January 1, 2026, section 24 of this bill prohibits, with certain
21 exceptions, a manufacturer from selling, offering for sale, distributing for sale or distributing
22 for use any carpet or rug, fabric treatment, food packaging, juvenile product, cosmetic, indoor
23 textile furnishing or indoor upholstered furniture that contains intentionally added
24 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 24 also authorizes a manufacturer of
25 such products to include a sticker on the product label that states “NO PFAS” to inform the
26 consumer that the product does not contain intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
27 polyfluoroalkyl substances.
28 Section 25 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer of cookware sold
29 in this State that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to
30 list those substances on the product label of the cookware and on any product listing for online
31 sales: (1) that the product contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
32 substances; and (2) an Internet address and QR code for a website that contains certain
33 information about the intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
34 Section 25 also authorizes a manufacturer of cookware that does not contain intentionally
35 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to include a sticker on the product label
36 that states “NO PFAS” to inform the consumer that the product does not contain intentionally
37 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Sections 6-22 of this bill define certain
38 terms related to such substances.
39 Section 26 of this bill provides that a person who willfully and knowingly violates the
40 provisions of section 24 or 25 is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for each
41 violation.
42 Section 23 of this bill provides an exception to the requirements and prohibitions set forth
43 in sections 5-26 of this bill to the extent that such provisions are preempted by or conflict with
44 federal law.
45 Existing law requires a redevelopment plan that contains a provision requiring that taxes
46 be levied upon taxable property in the respective redevelopment area to allocate certain excess
47 amounts of the levied taxes to pay the costs of redevelopment and certain debts relating to
48 redevelopment. (NRS 279.676) Existing law further requires that a certain percentage of such
49 allocated revenue be set aside for certain purposes relating to: (1) affordable housing; and (2)
50 public educational facilities, activities and programs. (NRS 279.685, 279.6855) Section 29 of
51 this bill provides that the existence of heat islands in a redevelopment area may be considered
52 blight. Section 29 requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) set aside 1 percent of such
53 allocated revenue received on or after October 1, 2025, to increase, improve or enhance
54 landscaping in existing neighborhoods to provide shade and reduce heat island effects in such
55 neighborhoods; and (2) perform certain actions relating to heat mitigation. Section 29 also
56 requires the redevelopment agency to prepare and submit a report to the Director of the
57 Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
58 Government Affairs or the Legislature, as appropriate, regarding the amount of such money
59 expended for those purposes and present the results of the report and any updates to certain
60 standing committees of the Legislature. Section 30 of this bill provides that the requirements
61 of section 29 are an exception to the requirement that all such excess allocated revenue be
62 pledged for the payment of the principal and interest on loans, advances and indebtedness
63 relating to redevelopment. Section 31 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the
64 placement of section 29 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
65 Section 37 of this bill requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) partner with certain
66 organizations to identify drought tolerant trees to plant pursuant to the requirements of section
67 29; and (2) contract with an arborist or the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of
68 Nevada, Reno, to identify and purchase tree seedlings for planting pursuant to the
69 requirements of section 29.

Assembly Amendment No. 955 to Senate Bill No. 173 Second Reprint Page 5
70 Existing law requires the Division of Emergency Management within the Office of the
71 Military to adopt regulations setting forth the manner in which federal funds received by the
72 Division to finance projects related to emergency management and homeland security are
73 allocated. (NRS 414.040) Section 32 of this bill requires the Division to, where appropriate
74 and applicable, apply for grants of money from the Federal Government or other sources to
75 reduce heat island effects where such heat island effects threaten the health and safety of the
76 residents of this State and may result in or worsen an emergency or disaster.
77 Existing law authorizes the Governor to prepare a state emergency management plan and
78 requires the Chief of the Division to foster the adoption of plans for emergency operations.
79 (NRS 414.040, 414.060) Existing law requires such plans to be developed and executed in
80 collaboration with persons and organizations that advocate for the needs of victims of
81 emergencies and disasters. (NRS 414.093) Section 33 of this bill requires such plans to
82 include plans for mitigating any severe heat experienced by the victims of emergencies or
83 disasters.
84 Existing law establishes certain requirements for food establishments. (Chapter 446 of
85 NRS) Section 33.3 of this bill: (1) requires a food establishment to ensure that each food-
86 contact surface in the food establishment is maintained in good repair and free from excessive
87 wear; (2) requires a health authority to visually inspect the condition and sanitation of all
88 food-contact surfaces during routine inspections of a food establishment; and (3) authorizes a
89 health authority to adopt certain requirements or protocols relating to the inspection of food-
90 contact surfaces.
91 Existing law creates the State Board of Cosmetology and requires the Board to oversee
92 applicants for a license and persons licensed in cosmetology, schools of cosmetology,
93 cosmetological establishments and facilities in which threading is conducted. (NRS 644A.200,
94 644A.250) Section 34 of this bill requires, in any county whose population is 700,000 or more
95 (currently Clark County), the Board to collect and test random samples sold or offered for sale
96 at retail stores in the county of: (1) hair products to determine whether the hair products
97 contain formaldehyde; and (2) braid hair, weaves and extensions to determine if the items
98 contain known carcinogens. Section 34 authorizes the Board to contract or enter into a
99 memorandum of understanding with a testing laboratory to conduct such testing.
100 Section 35 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada Center for Applied Research
101 of the University of Nevada, Reno, to develop a scientific test to determine whether packaged
102 synthetic hair braids contain formaldehyde and to purchase any necessary equipment and
103 equipment warranties.
104 Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Board to enter into a memorandum of understanding
105 with the Nevada System of Higher Education, on behalf of the Nevada Center for Applied
106 Research, relating to the testing required by section 34. Section 36 also requires that, if the
107 Board enters into such a memorandum of understanding, the Board must submit a
108 report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the 84th
109 Session of the Legislature that contains the results of the testing required by section 34.
