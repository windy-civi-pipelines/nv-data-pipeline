Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from

3 the food delivery service platform provider has entered into a written agreement
4 with the food dispensing establishment. (NRS 597.7635) Section 2 of this bill
5 requires a food delivery service platform provider to provide a user with the option
6 to request to receive disposable foodware or standard condiments from the food
7 dispensing establishment with his or her order. Section 2 also prohibits a food
8 dispensing establishment that has a written agreement with a food delivery service
9 platform provider from: (1) providing disposable foodware or standard condiments
10 with an order unless requested by the user; and (2) packaging or bundling
11 disposable foodware or standard condiments for single use in a manner that
12 prevents the user from receiving only the disposable foodware or standard
13 condiments that the user requested. Section 27 of this bill makes a conforming
14 change to indicate the placement of section 2 and applies certain existing
15 definitions relating to food delivery service platform providers to section 2. Section
16 28 of this bill provides that a violation of section 2 shall be deemed a deceptive
17 trade practice and is subject to certain existing civil and criminal penalties.
18 Beginning January 1, 2026, section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a manufacturer

26 a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.
27 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, the discharge, use or release of

29 polyfluoroalkyl substances for the purpose of testing the Class B firefighting foam
30 or firefighting training. (NRS 459.682) Beginning on January 1, 2026, section 24
31 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer from selling, offering
32 for sale, distributing for sale or distributing for use any carpet or rug, fabric
33 treatment, food packaging, juvenile product, cosmetic, indoor textile furnishing or

35 polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 24 also authorizes a manufacturer of such
36 products to include a sticker on the product label that states “NO PFAS” to inform
37 the consumer that the product does not contain intentionally added perfluoroalkyl
38 and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
39 Section 25 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer of
40 cookware sold in this State that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
41 polyfluoroalkyl substances to list those substances on the product label of the
42 cookware and on any product listing for online sales: (1) that the product contains
43 intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances; and (2) an
44 Internet address and QR code for a website that contains certain information about
45 the intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 25

50 Sections 6-22 of this bill define certain terms related to such substances.

54 prohibitions set forth in sections 5-26 of this bill to the extent that such provisions

56 Existing law requires a redevelopment plan that contains a provision requiring
57 that taxes be levied upon taxable property in the respective redevelopment area to
58 allocate certain excess amounts of the levied taxes to pay the costs of
59 redevelopment and certain debts relating to redevelopment. (NRS 279.676)
60 Existing law further requires that a certain percentage of such allocated revenue be
61 set aside for certain purposes relating to: (1) affordable housing; and (2) public

67 heat mitigation. Section 29 also requires the redevelopment agency to prepare and
68 submit a report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission
69 to the Legislative Commission or the Legislature, as appropriate, regarding the
70 amount of such money expended for those purposes. Section 30 of this bill

72 that all such excess allocated revenue be pledged for the payment of the principal
73 and interest on loans, advances and indebtedness relating to redevelopment.
74 Section 31 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the placement of
75 section 29 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

83 funds received by the Division to finance projects related to emergency
84 management and homeland security are allocated. (NRS 414.040) Section 32 of
85 this bill requires the Division to, where appropriate and applicable, apply for grants
86 of money from the Federal Government or other sources to reduce heat island
87 effects where such heat island effects threaten the health and safety of the residents
88 of this State and may result in or worsen an emergency or disaster.
89 Existing law authorizes the Governor to prepare a state emergency management
90 plan and requires the Chief of the Division to foster the adoption of plans for

92 be developed and executed in collaboration with persons and organizations that
93 advocate for the needs of victims of emergencies and disasters. (NRS 414.093)
94 Section 33 of this bill requires such plans to include plans for mitigating any severe
95 heat experienced by the victims of emergencies or disasters.
