Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from facilitating an
2 online food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless the food delivery service
3 platform provider has entered into a written agreement with the food dispensing
4 establishment. (NRS 597.7635) Section 2 of this bill requires a food delivery service platform
5 provider to provide a user with the option to request to receive disposable foodware
6 accessories or standard condiments from the food dispensing establishment with his or her
7 order. Section 2 also prohibits a food dispensing establishment that has a written agreement

Senate Amendment No. 308 to Senate Bill No. 173 Page 4
8 with a food delivery service platform provider from: (1) providing disposable foodware
9 accessories or standard condiments with an order unless requested by the user; and (2)
10 packaging or bundling disposable foodware accessories or standard condiments for single use
11 in a manner that prevents the user from receiving only the disposable foodware accessory or
12 standard condiments that the user requested. Section 27 of this bill makes a conforming
13 change to indicate the placement of section 2 and applies certain existing definitions relating
14 to food delivery service platform providers to section 2. Section 28 of this bill provides that a
15 violation of section 2 shall be deemed a deceptive trade practice and is subject to certain
16 existing civil and criminal penalties.
17 [Beginning January 1, 2026, section 3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a manufacturer from
18 selling, offering for sale or distributing for sale or use any disposable foodware, food
19 packaging or utensils that are made wholly or partially from recycled black plastic; and (2)
20 makes a willful and knowing violation of this prohibition subject to a civil penalty not to
21 exceed $1,000.
22 Beginning January 1, 2026, section 4 of this bill prohibits a manufacturer from selling,
23 offering for sale or distributing for sale or use any plastic bottle designed to hold liquid for
24 oral consumption and makes a violation of this prohibition subject to a civil penalty not to
25 exceed $1,000.]

27 B firefighting foam that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
28 substances for the purpose of testing the Class B firefighting foam or firefighting training.
29 (NRS 459.682) Beginning on January 1, 2026, section 24 of this bill prohibits, with certain
30 exceptions, a manufacturer from selling, offering for sale, distributing for sale or distributing
31 for use any carpet or rug, fabric treatment, food packaging, juvenile product, cosmetic, indoor
32 textile furnishing or indoor upholstered furniture that contains intentionally added
33 perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Section 24 also authorizes a manufacturer of
34 such products to include a sticker on the product label that states “NO PFAS” to inform the
35 consumer that the product does not contain intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and
36 polyfluoroalkyl substances.
37 Section 25 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, a manufacturer of cookware sold
38 in this State that contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to
39 list those substances on the product label of the cookware and on any product listing for online
40 sales: (1) that the product contains intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
41 substances; and (2) an Internet address and QR code for a website that contains certain
42 information about the intentionally added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.
43 Section 25 also authorizes a manufacturer of cookware that does not contain intentionally
44 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to include a sticker on the product label
45 that states “NO PFAS” to inform the consumer that the product does not contain intentionally
46 added perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Sections 6-22 of this bill define certain
47 terms related to such substances.
48 Section 26 of this bill provides that a person who willfully and knowingly violates the
49 provisions of section 24 or 25 is [guilty of a misdemeanor.] subject to a civil penalty of not
50 more than $1,000 for each violation.
51 Section 23 of this bill provides an exception to the requirements and prohibitions set forth
52 in sections 5-26 of this bill to the extent that such provisions are preempted by or conflict with
53 federal law.
54 Existing law requires a redevelopment plan that contains a provision requiring that taxes
55 be levied upon taxable property in the respective redevelopment area to allocate certain excess
56 amounts of the levied taxes to pay the costs of redevelopment and certain debts relating to
57 redevelopment. (NRS 279.676) Existing law further requires that a certain percentage of such
58 allocated revenue be set aside for certain purposes relating to: (1) affordable housing; and (2)
59 public educational facilities, activities and programs. (NRS 279.685, 279.6855) Section 29 of
60 this bill provides that the existence of heat islands in a redevelopment area may be
61 considered blight. Section 29 requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) set aside 1 percent of
62 such allocated revenue received on or after October 1, 2025, to increase, improve or enhance
63 landscaping in existing neighborhoods to provide shade and reduce heat island effects in such
64 neighborhoods; and (2) perform certain actions relating to heat mitigation. Section 29 also
65 requires the redevelopment agency to prepare and submit a report to the Director of the
66 Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislative Commission or the Legislature,

Senate Amendment No. 308 to Senate Bill No. 173 Page 5
67 as appropriate, regarding the amount of such money expended for those purposes. Section 30
68 of this bill provides that the requirements of section 29 are an exception to the requirement
69 that all such excess allocated revenue be pledged for the payment of the principal and interest
70 on loans, advances and indebtedness relating to redevelopment. Section 31 of this bill makes a
71 conforming change to indicate the placement of section 29 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
72 Section 37 of this bill requires a redevelopment agency to: (1) partner with certain
73 organizations to identify drought tolerant trees to plant pursuant to the requirements of section
74 29; and (2) contract with an arborist or the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of
75 Nevada, Reno, to identify and purchase tree seedlings for planting pursuant to the
76 requirements of section 29.
77 Existing law requires the Division of Emergency Management within the Office of the
78 Military to adopt regulations setting forth the manner in which federal funds received by the
79 Division to finance projects related to emergency management and homeland security are
80 allocated. (NRS 414.040) Section 32 of this bill requires the Division to, where appropriate
81 and applicable, apply for grants of money from the Federal Government or other sources to
82 reduce heat island effects where such heat island effects threaten the health and safety of the
83 residents of this State and may result in or worsen an emergency or disaster.
84 Existing law authorizes the Governor to prepare a state emergency management plan and
85 requires the Chief of the Division to foster the adoption of plans for emergency operations.
86 (NRS 414.040, 414.060) Existing law requires such plans to be developed and executed in
87 collaboration with persons and organizations that advocate for the needs of victims of
88 emergencies and disasters. (NRS 414.093) Section 33 of this bill requires such plans to
89 include plans for mitigating any severe heat experienced by the victims of emergencies or
90 disasters.
91 Existing law establishes certain requirements for food establishments. (Chapter 446
92 of NRS) Section 33.3 of this bill: (1) prohibits a food establishment from using a plastic
93 cutting board to prepare food in the food establishment; and (2) provides for certain
94 escalating administrative fines for a violation of this prohibition. Section 33.7 of this bill
95 provides that these administrative fines are an exception to certain criminal penalties
