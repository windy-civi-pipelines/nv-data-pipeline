Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes procedures relating to the appointment of guardians of minors
2 and prescribes the powers and duties of the guardians. (Chapter 159A of NRS) Specifically,
3 existing law requires a notice of a petition in a guardianship proceeding for a minor, the
4 petition and a citation relating to the time and place of the hearing on the petition to be served
5 on certain persons. (NRS 159A.034, 159A.047, 159A.0475) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of this bill
6 make various changes related to the persons who are required to be served with the notice,
7 petition or citation.
8 Existing law prescribes the method of service related to certain petitions and citations
9 required to be served in guardianship proceedings for minors. (NRS 159A.034, 159A.0475,
10 159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 3, 9, 13 and 14 of this bill make various changes related to the
11 method of service.
12 Existing law requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor to include
13 certain information. (NRS 159A.044) Similarly, existing law sets forth the information that
14 must be contained in a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian of a minor. (NRS
15 159A.053) Sections 4 and 14 of this bill revise the information that is required to be
16 contained in the petition for the appointment of a guardian and a petition for the appointment
17 of a temporary guardian, respectively.
18 Existing law requires a proposed guardian to file a proposed preliminary care plan and
19 budget under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0445) Section 5 of this bill: (1) expands the
20 circumstances under which a proposed guardian may be required to file a proposed
21 preliminary care plan and budget; and (2) requires the annual review and revision of the
22 budget under certain circumstances.
23 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a protected minor or
24 proposed protected minor in guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159A.045) Section 6 of this bill
25 provides that if a court appoints an attorney to represent a protected minor or proposed
26 protected minor in a jurisdiction where there are certain established programs for legal
Assembly Amendment No. 148 to Assembly Bill No. 387 Page 4
27 services, the court must appoint an attorney from that program in those circumstances.
28 Section 6 also establishes provisions that address the scenario under which the program for
29 legal services has insufficient funding to support the representation of each child who would
30 otherwise qualify for the appointment of an attorney under the new procedures [.] and
31 requires such attorneys to comply with the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct.
32 Sections 7 and 10 of this bill make certain changes to reflect the procedures for the
33 appointment of an attorney under section 6.
34 Section 11 of this bill deems a protected minor or proposed protected minor who is the
35 subject of guardianship proceedings to be a party to the proceedings.
36 Existing law authorizes a court to determine that a petitioner is a vexatious litigant under
37 certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0486) Section 12 of this bill expands the circumstances
38 under which a court may find that a petitioner is a vexatious litigant to include certain acts
39 involving a parent of a protected minor or proposed protected minor.
40 Existing law authorizes a person to petition the court for the appointment of a
41 temporary guardian under certain circumstances. (159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 13 and
42 14 make various changes to these procedures for the purpose of providing that a court
43 may require a hearing on the petition before determining the need to appoint a
44 temporary guardian.
45 Existing law requires a proposed protected minor to attend a hearing for the appointment
46 of a guardian unless certain evidence is shown to the court. (NRS 159A.0535) Section 15 of
47 this bill removes this requirement related to the evidence and instead authorizes the court to
48 waive the requirement for physical attendance or remote appearance for good cause shown.
49 Existing law establishes various procedures related to the issuance of orders for the
50 appointment of a guardian and the burden of proof for the petitioner and certain other persons.
51 (NRS 159A.055, 159A.0565, 159A.061) Section 16 of this bill requires the petitioner to prove
52 by clear and convincing evidence that the appointment of a guardian is in the best interests of
53 the proposed protected minor. Sections 16-18 of this bill also make various changes related to
54 the issuance of such orders.
55 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to perform certain duties that are
56 necessary for the proper care, maintenance, education and support of the protected minor.
57 (NRS 159A.079) Section 20 of this bill additionally requires a guardian to [ensure that]
58 facilitate appropriate contact between a protected minor [maintains a relationship with] and
59 each parent of the protected minor under certain circumstances.
60 Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to the placement of a protected
61 minor in a secured residential long-term care facility. (NRS 159A.079, 159A.0807) Sections
62 20 and 21 of this bill make these requirements applicable to the placement of a protected
63 minor in a facility that provides residential treatment.
64 Sections 20 and 22 of this bill also remove certain unnecessary references to the
65 employment of certain providers of health care by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
66 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to file an annual report and
67 prescribes the required contents of the report. (NRS 159A.081) Section 23 of this bill requires
68 the report to include the frequency of visitation between the protected minor and any parent of
69 the protected minor.
70 Existing law establishes the duties of a guardian of the estate of a protected minor. (NRS
71 159A.083) Section 24 of this bill revises and expands the duties of a guardian of the estate
72 related to investing, financial accounting, the expenditure of money and the management of
73 certain other property. Section 27 of this bill makes similar changes concerning the
74 expenditure of money related to a guardian of a protected minor who is not a guardian of the
75 estate of a protected minor. (NRS 159A.112) Sections 19, [26, 28-31] 25-31, 36 and 39 of
76 this bill make various other changes related to the estate of a protected minor.
77 Existing law requires a guardian to notify the court if the guardian is subject to certain
78 disqualifying events. (NRS 159A.1852) Section 32 of this bill removes certain circumstances
79 under which a guardian is required to provide such notice.
80 Existing law authorizes certain persons to petition the court to remove a guardian. (NRS
81 159A.1853) Section 33 of this bill revises the persons who may file such a petition by
82 removing the authority of a public guardian to file the petition and additionally authorizing an
83 attorney of a protected minor or agency which provides child welfare services to file the
84 petition. Section 37 of this bill requires a court to consider certain factors related to petitions
85 filed by the parent of a protected minor. (NRS 159A.1915)
Assembly Amendment No. 148 to Assembly Bill No. 387 Page 5
86 Sections 33, 35, 38 and 40 of this bill revise the remedial actions that can be taken by a
87 court under certain circumstances.
88 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint another guardian when a guardian dies or is
89 removed by an order of the court. (NRS 159A.187) Section 34 of this bill requires the court to
90 provide notice of the matter to an agency which provides child welfare services if a guardian
91 dies or is removed and there is not a qualified guardian or temporary substitute guardian
92 willing to serve.
93 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “agency which provides child welfare services” for
94 the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianships of minors. Section 2 of this bill
95 makes a conforming change to indicate that the definition applies to the existing provisions of
96 law.
97 Section 42 of this bill repeals various provisions of law related to the guardianship of
98 minors. Sections 2-4, 8 [,] and 9 [, 25-28, 36 and 41] of this bill make conforming changes
99 relating to the repeal of such provisions.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to guardianship; revising provisions relating to service of certain
notices, petitions and citations relating to guardianships of minors;
revising provisions relating to the appointment, modification, removal
or termination of guardianships of minors; revising provisions relating
to the powers and duties of guardians of minors; revising provisions
relating to the management of the estates, property and other assets of
protected minors; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes procedures relating to the appointment of guardians of minors
2 and prescribes the powers and duties of the guardians. (Chapter 159A of NRS) Specifically,
3 existing law requires a notice of a petition in a guardianship proceeding for a minor, the
4 petition and a citation relating to the time and place of the hearing on the petition to be served
5 on certain persons. (NRS 159A.034, 159A.047, 159A.0475) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of this bill
6 make various changes related to the persons who are required to be served with the notice,
7 petition or citation.
8 Existing law prescribes the method of service related to certain petitions and citations
9 required to be served in guardianship proceedings for minors. (NRS 159A.034, 159A.0475,
10 159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 3, 9, 13 and 14 of this bill make various changes related to the
11 method of service.
12 Existing law requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor to include
13 certain information. (NRS 159A.044) Similarly, existing law sets forth the information that
14 must be contained in a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian of a minor. (NRS
15 159A.053) Sections 4 and 14 of this bill revise the information that is required to be
16 contained in the petition for the appointment of a guardian and a petition for the appointment
17 of a temporary guardian, respectively.
18 Existing law requires a proposed guardian to file a proposed preliminary care plan and
19 budget under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0445) Section 5 of this bill: (1) expands the
20 circumstances under which a proposed guardian may be required to file a proposed
21 preliminary care plan and budget; and (2) requires the annual review and revision of the
22 budget under certain circumstances.
23 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a protected minor or
24 proposed protected minor in guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159A.045) Section 6 of this bill
25 provides that if a court appoints an attorney to represent a protected minor or proposed
26 protected minor in a jurisdiction where there are certain established programs for legal

Assembly Amendment No. 148 to Assembly Bill No. 387 Page 4
27 services, the court must appoint an attorney from that program in those circumstances.
28 Section 6 also establishes provisions that address the scenario under which the program for
29 legal services has insufficient funding to support the representation of each child who would
30 otherwise qualify for the appointment of an attorney under the new procedures [.] and
31 requires such attorneys to comply with the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct.
32 Sections 7 and 10 of this bill make certain changes to reflect the procedures for the
33 appointment of an attorney under section 6.
34 Section 11 of this bill deems a protected minor or proposed protected minor who is the
35 subject of guardianship proceedings to be a party to the proceedings.
36 Existing law authorizes a court to determine that a petitioner is a vexatious litigant under
37 certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0486) Section 12 of this bill expands the circumstances
38 under which a court may find that a petitioner is a vexatious litigant to include certain acts
39 involving a parent of a protected minor or proposed protected minor.
40 Existing law authorizes a person to petition the court for the appointment of a
41 temporary guardian under certain circumstances. (159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 13 and
42 14 make various changes to these procedures for the purpose of providing that a court
43 may require a hearing on the petition before determining the need to appoint a
44 temporary guardian.
45 Existing law requires a proposed protected minor to attend a hearing for the appointment
46 of a guardian unless certain evidence is shown to the court. (NRS 159A.0535) Section 15 of
47 this bill removes this requirement related to the evidence and instead authorizes the court to
48 waive the requirement for physical attendance or remote appearance for good cause shown.
49 Existing law establishes various procedures related to the issuance of orders for the
50 appointment of a guardian and the burden of proof for the petitioner and certain other persons.
51 (NRS 159A.055, 159A.0565, 159A.061) Section 16 of this bill requires the petitioner to prove
52 by clear and convincing evidence that the appointment of a guardian is in the best interests of
53 the proposed protected minor. Sections 16-18 of this bill also make various changes related to
54 the issuance of such orders.
55 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to perform certain duties that are
56 necessary for the proper care, maintenance, education and support of the protected minor.
57 (NRS 159A.079) Section 20 of this bill additionally requires a guardian to [ensure that]
58 facilitate appropriate contact between a protected minor [maintains a relationship with] and
59 each parent of the protected minor under certain circumstances.
60 Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to the placement of a protected
61 minor in a secured residential long-term care facility. (NRS 159A.079, 159A.0807) Sections
62 20 and 21 of this bill make these requirements applicable to the placement of a protected
63 minor in a facility that provides residential treatment.
64 Sections 20 and 22 of this bill also remove certain unnecessary references to the
65 employment of certain providers of health care by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
66 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to file an annual report and
67 prescribes the required contents of the report. (NRS 159A.081) Section 23 of this bill requires
68 the report to include the frequency of visitation between the protected minor and any parent of
69 the protected minor.
70 Existing law establishes the duties of a guardian of the estate of a protected minor. (NRS
71 159A.083) Section 24 of this bill revises and expands the duties of a guardian of the estate
72 related to investing, financial accounting, the expenditure of money and the management of
73 certain other property. Section 27 of this bill makes similar changes concerning the
74 expenditure of money related to a guardian of a protected minor who is not a guardian of the
75 estate of a protected minor. (NRS 159A.112) Sections 19, [26, 28-31] 25-31, 36 and 39 of
76 this bill make various other changes related to the estate of a protected minor.
77 Existing law requires a guardian to notify the court if the guardian is subject to certain
78 disqualifying events. (NRS 159A.1852) Section 32 of this bill removes certain circumstances
79 under which a guardian is required to provide such notice.
80 Existing law authorizes certain persons to petition the court to remove a guardian. (NRS
81 159A.1853) Section 33 of this bill revises the persons who may file such a petition by
82 removing the authority of a public guardian to file the petition and additionally authorizing an
83 attorney of a protected minor or agency which provides child welfare services to file the
84 petition. Section 37 of this bill requires a court to consider certain factors related to petitions
85 filed by the parent of a protected minor. (NRS 159A.1915)

Assembly Amendment No. 148 to Assembly Bill No. 387 Page 5
86 Sections 33, 35, 38 and 40 of this bill revise the remedial actions that can be taken by a
87 court under certain circumstances.
88 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint another guardian when a guardian dies or is
89 removed by an order of the court. (NRS 159A.187) Section 34 of this bill requires the court to
90 provide notice of the matter to an agency which provides child welfare services if a guardian
91 dies or is removed and there is not a qualified guardian or temporary substitute guardian
92 willing to serve.
93 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “agency which provides child welfare services” for
94 the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianships of minors. Section 2 of this bill
95 makes a conforming change to indicate that the definition applies to the existing provisions of
96 law.
97 Section 42 of this bill repeals various provisions of law related to the guardianship of
98 minors. Sections 2-4, 8 [,] and 9 [, 25-28, 36 and 41] of this bill make conforming changes
99 relating to the repeal of such provisions.

27 interests of the protected minor.

31 actually pursuing the best interests of the protected minor.
32 6. The court shall not approve compensation for an attorney for:
33 (a) Time spent on internal business activities of the attorney, including, without
34 limitation, clerical or secretarial support; or
35 (b) Time reported as a total amount of time spent on multiple tasks, rather than
36 an itemization of the time spent on each task.
37 7. Any fees paid by a third party, including, without limitation, a trust of
38 which the estate is a beneficiary, must be disclosed to and approved by the court.
39 8. In addition to any payment provided to a person pursuant to this section for

43 for the appointment of a guardian or otherwise litigate any contested issue in the
44 guardianship proceeding, only the prevailing party may petition the court for
45 payment of attorney’s fees and costs from the guardianship estate pursuant to this
46 section. If the court determines that there is no prevailing party, the court may
47 authorize a portion of each party’s attorney’s fees and costs to be paid from the
48 guardianship estate if the court determines that such fees and costs are just,
49 reasonable and necessary given the nature of any issues in dispute.
50 10. If an attorney is appointed by the court in a guardianship proceeding, he
51 or she may petition the court for compensation for his or her services from the
52 guardianship estate in accordance with the procedure set forth in this section.
