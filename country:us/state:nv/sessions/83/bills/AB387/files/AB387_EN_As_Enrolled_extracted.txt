Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes procedures relating to the appointment of guardians of
minors and prescribes the powers and duties of the guardians. (Chapter 159A of
NRS) Specifically, existing law requires a notice of a petition in a guardianship
proceeding for a minor, the petition and a citation relating to the time and place of
the hearing on the petition to be served on certain persons. (NRS 159A.034,
159A.047, 159A.0475) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of this bill make various changes
related to the persons who are required to be served with the notice, petition or
citation.
Existing law prescribes the method of service related to certain petitions and
citations required to be served in guardianship proceedings for minors. (NRS
159A.034, 159A.0475, 159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 3, 9, 13 and 14 of this bill
make various changes related to the method of service.
Existing law requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor to
include certain information. (NRS 159A.044) Similarly, existing law sets forth the
information that must be contained in a petition for the appointment of a temporary
guardian of a minor. (NRS 159A.053) Sections 4 and 14 of this bill revise the
information that is required to be contained in the petition for the appointment of a
guardian and a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian, respectively.
Existing law requires a proposed guardian to file a proposed preliminary care
plan and budget under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0445) Section 5 of this
bill: (1) expands the circumstances under which a proposed guardian may be
required to file a proposed preliminary care plan and budget; and (2) requires the
annual review and revision of the budget under certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a protected
minor or proposed protected minor in guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159A.045)

Section 2:
Section 6 of this bill provides that if a court appoints an attorney to represent a
protected minor or proposed protected minor in a jurisdiction where there are
certain established programs for legal services, the court must appoint an attorney
from that program in those circumstances. Section 6 also establishes provisions that
address the scenario under which the program for legal services has insufficient
funding to support the representation of each child who would otherwise qualify for
the appointment of an attorney under the new procedures and requires such
attorneys to comply with the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct. Sections 7
and 10 of this bill make certain changes to reflect the procedures for the
appointment of an attorney under section 6.

Section 3:
Section 11 of this bill deems a protected minor or proposed protected minor
who is the subject of guardianship proceedings to be a party to the proceedings.

litigant under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0486) Section 12 of this bill

providing that a court may require a hearing on the petition before determining the
need to appoint a temporary guardian.
Existing law requires a proposed protected minor to attend a hearing for the
appointment of a guardian unless certain evidence is shown to the court. (NRS
159A.0535) Section 15 of this bill removes this requirement related to the evidence
and instead authorizes the court to waive the requirement for physical attendance or
remote appearance for good cause shown.
Existing law establishes various procedures related to the issuance of orders for
the appointment of a guardian and the burden of proof for the petitioner and certain
other persons. (NRS 159A.055, 159A.0565, 159A.061) Section 16 of this bill
requires the petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
appointment of a guardian is in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.

Sections 16-18 of this bill also make various changes related to the issuance of
such orders.

that are necessary for the proper care, maintenance, education and support of the

guardian to facilitate appropriate contact between a protected minor and each parent
of the protected minor under certain circumstances.
Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to the placement of a
protected minor in a secured residential long-term care facility. (NRS 159A.079,

Sections 20 and 22 of this bill also remove certain unnecessary references to
the employment of certain providers of health care by the Department of Veterans
Affairs.

this bill requires the report to include the frequency of visitation between the
protected minor and any parent of the protected minor.
Existing law establishes the duties of a guardian of the estate of a protected
minor. (NRS 159A.083) Section 24 of this bill revises and expands the duties of a
guardian of the estate related to investing, financial accounting, the expenditure of
money and the management of certain other property. Section 27 of this bill makes
similar changes concerning the expenditure of money related to a guardian of a
protected minor who is not a guardian of the estate of a protected minor. (NRS
159A.112) Sections 19, 25-31, 36 and 39 of this bill make various other changes
related to the estate of a protected minor.
Existing law requires a guardian to notify the court if the guardian is subject to
certain disqualifying events. (NRS 159A.1852) Section 32 of this bill removes
certain circumstances under which a guardian is required to provide such notice.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to petition the court to remove a
guardian. (NRS 159A.1853) Section 33 of this bill revises the persons who may file
such a petition by removing the authority of a public guardian to file the petition
and additionally authorizing an attorney of a protected minor or agency which
-
83rd Session (2025)

Sections 33, 35, 38 and 40 of this bill revise the remedial actions that can be
taken by a court under certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes a court to appoint another guardian when a guardian
dies or is removed by an order of the court. (NRS 159A.187) Section 34 of this bill
requires the court to provide notice of the matter to an agency which provides child
welfare services if a guardian dies or is removed and there is not a qualified
guardian or temporary substitute guardian willing to serve.

Section 8:
Section 1 of this bill defines the term “agency which provides child welfare
services” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianships of
minors. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the
definition applies to the existing provisions of law.

Section 9:

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 387–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to guardianship; revising provisions relating to
service of certain notices, petitions and citations relating to
guardianships of minors; revising provisions relating to the
appointment, modification, removal or termination of
guardianships of minors; revising provisions relating to the
powers and duties of guardians of minors; revising provisions
relating to the management of the estates, property and other
assets of protected minors; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes procedures relating to the appointment of guardians of
minors and prescribes the powers and duties of the guardians. (Chapter 159A of
NRS) Specifically, existing law requires a notice of a petition in a guardianship
proceeding for a minor, the petition and a citation relating to the time and place of
the hearing on the petition to be served on certain persons. (NRS 159A.034,
159A.047, 159A.0475) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of this bill make various changes
related to the persons who are required to be served with the notice, petition or
citation.
Existing law prescribes the method of service related to certain petitions and
citations required to be served in guardianship proceedings for minors. (NRS
159A.034, 159A.0475, 159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 3, 9, 13 and 14 of this bill
make various changes related to the method of service.
Existing law requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor to
include certain information. (NRS 159A.044) Similarly, existing law sets forth the
information that must be contained in a petition for the appointment of a temporary
guardian of a minor. (NRS 159A.053) Sections 4 and 14 of this bill revise the
information that is required to be contained in the petition for the appointment of a
guardian and a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian, respectively.
Existing law requires a proposed guardian to file a proposed preliminary care
plan and budget under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0445) Section 5 of this
bill: (1) expands the circumstances under which a proposed guardian may be
required to file a proposed preliminary care plan and budget; and (2) requires the
annual review and revision of the budget under certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a protected
minor or proposed protected minor in guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159A.045)
Section 6 of this bill provides that if a court appoints an attorney to represent a
protected minor or proposed protected minor in a jurisdiction where there are
certain established programs for legal services, the court must appoint an attorney
from that program in those circumstances. Section 6 also establishes provisions that
address the scenario under which the program for legal services has insufficient
funding to support the representation of each child who would otherwise qualify for
the appointment of an attorney under the new procedures and requires such
attorneys to comply with the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct. Sections 7
and 10 of this bill make certain changes to reflect the procedures for the
appointment of an attorney under section 6.
Section 11 of this bill deems a protected minor or proposed protected minor
who is the subject of guardianship proceedings to be a party to the proceedings.

Existing law authorizes a court to determine that a petitioner is a vexatious
litigant under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0486) Section 12 of this bill
expands the circumstances under which a court may find that a petitioner is a
vexatious litigant to include certain acts involving a parent of a protected minor or
proposed protected minor.
Existing law authorizes a person to petition the court for the appointment of a
temporary guardian under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.052, 159A.053)
Sections 13 and 14 make various changes to these procedures for the purpose of
providing that a court may require a hearing on the petition before determining the
need to appoint a temporary guardian.
Existing law requires a proposed protected minor to attend a hearing for the
appointment of a guardian unless certain evidence is shown to the court. (NRS
159A.0535) Section 15 of this bill removes this requirement related to the evidence
and instead authorizes the court to waive the requirement for physical attendance or
remote appearance for good cause shown.
Existing law establishes various procedures related to the issuance of orders for
the appointment of a guardian and the burden of proof for the petitioner and certain
other persons. (NRS 159A.055, 159A.0565, 159A.061) Section 16 of this bill
requires the petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
appointment of a guardian is in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.
Sections 16-18 of this bill also make various changes related to the issuance of
such orders.
Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to perform certain duties
that are necessary for the proper care, maintenance, education and support of the
protected minor. (NRS 159A.079) Section 20 of this bill additionally requires a
guardian to facilitate appropriate contact between a protected minor and each parent
of the protected minor under certain circumstances.
Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to the placement of a
protected minor in a secured residential long-term care facility. (NRS 159A.079,
159A.0807) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill make these requirements applicable to
the placement of a protected minor in a facility that provides residential treatment.
Sections 20 and 22 of this bill also remove certain unnecessary references to
the employment of certain providers of health care by the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to file an annual report
and prescribes the required contents of the report. (NRS 159A.081) Section 23 of
this bill requires the report to include the frequency of visitation between the
protected minor and any parent of the protected minor.
Existing law establishes the duties of a guardian of the estate of a protected
minor. (NRS 159A.083) Section 24 of this bill revises and expands the duties of a
guardian of the estate related to investing, financial accounting, the expenditure of
money and the management of certain other property. Section 27 of this bill makes
similar changes concerning the expenditure of money related to a guardian of a
protected minor who is not a guardian of the estate of a protected minor. (NRS
159A.112) Sections 19, 25-31, 36 and 39 of this bill make various other changes
related to the estate of a protected minor.
Existing law requires a guardian to notify the court if the guardian is subject to
certain disqualifying events. (NRS 159A.1852) Section 32 of this bill removes
certain circumstances under which a guardian is required to provide such notice.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to petition the court to remove a
guardian. (NRS 159A.1853) Section 33 of this bill revises the persons who may file
such a petition by removing the authority of a public guardian to file the petition
and additionally authorizing an attorney of a protected minor or agency which
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
provides child welfare services to file the petition. Section 37 of this bill requires a
court to consider certain factors related to petitions filed by the parent of a
protected minor. (NRS 159A.1915)
Sections 33, 35, 38 and 40 of this bill revise the remedial actions that can be
taken by a court under certain circumstances.
Existing law authorizes a court to appoint another guardian when a guardian
dies or is removed by an order of the court. (NRS 159A.187) Section 34 of this bill
requires the court to provide notice of the matter to an agency which provides child
welfare services if a guardian dies or is removed and there is not a qualified
guardian or temporary substitute guardian willing to serve.
Section 1 of this bill defines the term “agency which provides child welfare
services” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianships of
minors. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the
definition applies to the existing provisions of law.
Section 42 of this bill repeals various provisions of law related to the
guardianship of minors. Sections 2-4, 8 and 9 of this bill make conforming changes
relating to the repeal of such provisions.
