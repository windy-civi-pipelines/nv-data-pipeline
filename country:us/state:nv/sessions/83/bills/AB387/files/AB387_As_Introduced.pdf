Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes procedures relating to the appointment of guardians of
2 minors and prescribes the powers and duties of the guardians. (Chapter 159A of
3 NRS) Specifically, existing law requires a notice of a petition in a guardianship
4 proceeding for a minor, the petition and a citation relating to the time and place of
5 the hearing on the petition to be served on certain persons. (NRS 159A.034,
6 159A.047, 159A.0475) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of this bill make various changes
7 related to the persons who are required to be served with the notice, petition or
8 citation.
9 Existing law prescribes the method of service related to certain petitions and
10 citations required to be served in guardianship proceedings for minors. (NRS
11 159A.034, 159A.0475, 159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 3, 9, 13 and 14 of this bill
12 make various changes related to the method of service.
13 Existing law requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor to
14 include certain information. (NRS 159A.044) Similarly, existing law sets forth the
15 information that must be contained in a petition for the appointment of a temporary
16 guardian of a minor. (NRS 159A.053) Sections 4 and 14 of this bill revise the
17 information that is required to be contained in the petition for the appointment of a
18 guardian and a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian, respectively.

19 Existing law requires a proposed guardian to file a proposed preliminary care
20 plan and budget under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0445) Section 5 of this
21 bill: (1) expands the circumstances under which a proposed guardian may be
22 required to file a proposed preliminary care plan and budget; and (2) requires the
23 annual review and revision of the budget under certain circumstances.
24 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a protected
25 minor or proposed protected minor in guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159A.045)
26 Section 6 of this bill provides that if a court appoints an attorney to represent a
27 protected minor or proposed protected minor in a jurisdiction where there are
28 certain established programs for legal services, the court must appoint an attorney
29 from that program in those circumstances. Section 6 also establishes provisions that
30 address the scenario under which the program for legal services has insufficient
31 funding to support the representation of each child who would otherwise qualify for
32 the appointment of an attorney under the new procedures. Sections 7 and 10 of this
33 bill make certain changes to reflect the procedures for the appointment of an
34 attorney under section 6.
35 Section 11 of this bill deems a protected minor or proposed protected minor
36 who is the subject of guardianship proceedings to be a party to the proceedings.
37 Existing law authorizes a court to determine that a petitioner is a vexatious
38 litigant under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0486) Section 12 of this bill
39 expands the circumstances under which a court may find that a petitioner is a
40 vexatious litigant to include certain acts involving a parent of a protected minor or
41 proposed protected minor.
42 Existing law requires a proposed protected minor to attend a hearing for the
43 appointment of a guardian unless certain evidence is shown to the court. (NRS
44 159A.0535) Section 15 of this bill removes this requirement related to the evidence
45 and instead authorizes the court to waive the requirement for physical attendance or
46 remote appearance for good cause shown.
47 Existing law establishes various procedures related to the issuance of orders for
48 the appointment of a guardian and the burden of proof for the petitioner and certain
49 other persons. (NRS 159A.055, 159A.0565, 159A.061) Section 16 of this bill
50 requires the petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
51 appointment of a guardian is in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.
52 Sections 16-18 of this bill also make various changes related to the issuance of
53 such orders.
54 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to perform certain duties
55 that are necessary for the proper care, maintenance, education and support of the
56 protected minor. (NRS 159A.079) Section 20 of this bill additionally requires a
57 guardian to ensure that a protected minor maintains a relationship with each parent
58 of the protected minor under certain circumstances.
59 Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to the placement of a
60 protected minor in a secured residential long-term care facility. (NRS 159A.079,
61 159A.0807) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill make these requirements applicable to
62 the placement of a protected minor in a facility that provides residential treatment.
63 Sections 20 and 22 of this bill also remove certain unnecessary references to
64 the employment of certain providers of health care by the Department of Veterans
65 Affairs.
66 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to file an annual report
67 and prescribes the required contents of the report. (NRS 159A.081) Section 23 of
68 this bill requires the report to include the frequency of visitation between the
69 protected minor and any parent of the protected minor.
70 Existing law establishes the duties of a guardian of the estate of a protected
71 minor. (NRS 159A.083) Section 24 of this bill revises and expands the duties of a
72 guardian of the estate related to investing, financial accounting, the expenditure of
73 money and the management of certain other property. Section 27 of this bill makes
-
*AB387*

– 3 –
74 similar changes concerning the expenditure of money related to a guardian of a
75 protected minor who is not a guardian of the estate of a protected minor. (NRS
76 159A.112) Sections 19, 26, 28-31 and 39 of this bill make various other changes
77 related to the estate of a protected minor.
78 Existing law requires a guardian to notify the court if the guardian is subject to
79 certain disqualifying events. (NRS 159A.1852) Section 32 of this bill removes
80 certain circumstances under which a guardian is required to provide such notice.
81 Existing law authorizes certain persons to petition the court to remove a
82 guardian. (NRS 159A.1853) Section 33 of this bill revises the persons who may file
83 such a petition by removing the authority of a public guardian to file the petition
84 and additionally authorizing an attorney of a protected minor or agency which
85 provides child welfare services to file the petition. Section 37 of this bill requires a
86 court to consider certain factors related to petitions filed by the parent of a
87 protected minor. (NRS 159A.1915)
88 Sections 33, 35, 38 and 40 of this bill revise the remedial actions that can be
89 taken by a court under certain circumstances.
90 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint another guardian when a guardian
91 dies or is removed by an order of the court. (NRS 159A.187) Section 34 of this bill
92 requires the court to provide notice of the matter to an agency which provides child
93 welfare services if a guardian dies or is removed and there is not a qualified
94 guardian or temporary substitute guardian willing to serve.
95 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “agency which provides child welfare
96 services” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianships of
97 minors. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the
98 definition applies to the existing provisions of law.
99 Section 42 of this bill repeals various provisions of law related to the
100 guardianship of minors. Sections 2-4, 8, 9, 25-28, 36 and 41 of this bill make
101 conforming changes relating to the repeal of such provisions.

27 person or estate of a proposed protected minor and who should be
28 appointed, the court must always act in the best interests of the
