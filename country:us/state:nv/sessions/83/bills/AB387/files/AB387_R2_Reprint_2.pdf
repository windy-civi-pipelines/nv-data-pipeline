Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes procedures relating to the appointment of guardians of
2 minors and prescribes the powers and duties of the guardians. (Chapter 159A of
3 NRS) Specifically, existing law requires a notice of a petition in a guardianship
4 proceeding for a minor, the petition and a citation relating to the time and place of
5 the hearing on the petition to be served on certain persons. (NRS 159A.034,
6 159A.047, 159A.0475) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of this bill make various changes
7 related to the persons who are required to be served with the notice, petition or
8 citation.
9 Existing law prescribes the method of service related to certain petitions and
10 citations required to be served in guardianship proceedings for minors. (NRS
11 159A.034, 159A.0475, 159A.052, 159A.053) Sections 3, 9, 13 and 14 of this bill
12 make various changes related to the method of service.
13 Existing law requires a petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor to
14 include certain information. (NRS 159A.044) Similarly, existing law sets forth the
15 information that must be contained in a petition for the appointment of a temporary
16 guardian of a minor. (NRS 159A.053) Sections 4 and 14 of this bill revise the

19 Existing law requires a proposed guardian to file a proposed preliminary care
20 plan and budget under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0445) Section 5 of this
21 bill: (1) expands the circumstances under which a proposed guardian may be
22 required to file a proposed preliminary care plan and budget; and (2) requires the
23 annual review and revision of the budget under certain circumstances.
24 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint an attorney to represent a protected
25 minor or proposed protected minor in guardianship proceedings. (NRS 159A.045)
26 Section 6 of this bill provides that if a court appoints an attorney to represent a
27 protected minor or proposed protected minor in a jurisdiction where there are
28 certain established programs for legal services, the court must appoint an attorney
29 from that program in those circumstances. Section 6 also establishes provisions that
30 address the scenario under which the program for legal services has insufficient
31 funding to support the representation of each child who would otherwise qualify for
32 the appointment of an attorney under the new procedures and requires such
33 attorneys to comply with the Nevada Rules of Professional Conduct. Sections 7
34 and 10 of this bill make certain changes to reflect the procedures for the
35 appointment of an attorney under section 6.
36 Section 11 of this bill deems a protected minor or proposed protected minor
37 who is the subject of guardianship proceedings to be a party to the proceedings.
38 Existing law authorizes a court to determine that a petitioner is a vexatious
39 litigant under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.0486) Section 12 of this bill
40 expands the circumstances under which a court may find that a petitioner is a
41 vexatious litigant to include certain acts involving a parent of a protected minor or
42 proposed protected minor.
43 Existing law authorizes a person to petition the court for the appointment of a
44 temporary guardian under certain circumstances. (NRS 159A.052, 159A.053)
45 Sections 13 and 14 make various changes to these procedures for the purpose of
46 providing that a court may require a hearing on the petition before determining the
47 need to appoint a temporary guardian.
48 Existing law requires a proposed protected minor to attend a hearing for the
49 appointment of a guardian unless certain evidence is shown to the court. (NRS
50 159A.0535) Section 15 of this bill removes this requirement related to the evidence
51 and instead authorizes the court to waive the requirement for physical attendance or
52 remote appearance for good cause shown.
53 Existing law establishes various procedures related to the issuance of orders for
54 the appointment of a guardian and the burden of proof for the petitioner and certain
55 other persons. (NRS 159A.055, 159A.0565, 159A.061) Section 16 of this bill
56 requires the petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
57 appointment of a guardian is in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.
58 Sections 16-18 of this bill also make various changes related to the issuance of
59 such orders.
60 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to perform certain duties
61 that are necessary for the proper care, maintenance, education and support of the
62 protected minor. (NRS 159A.079) Section 20 of this bill additionally requires a
63 guardian to facilitate appropriate contact between a protected minor and each parent
64 of the protected minor under certain circumstances.
65 Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to the placement of a
66 protected minor in a secured residential long-term care facility. (NRS 159A.079,
67 159A.0807) Sections 20 and 21 of this bill make these requirements applicable to
68 the placement of a protected minor in a facility that provides residential treatment.
69 Sections 20 and 22 of this bill also remove certain unnecessary references to
70 the employment of certain providers of health care by the Department of Veterans
71 Affairs.
72 Existing law requires a guardian of a protected minor to file an annual report
73 and prescribes the required contents of the report. (NRS 159A.081) Section 23 of
-
*AB387_R2*

– 3 –
74 this bill requires the report to include the frequency of visitation between the
75 protected minor and any parent of the protected minor.
76 Existing law establishes the duties of a guardian of the estate of a protected
77 minor. (NRS 159A.083) Section 24 of this bill revises and expands the duties of a
78 guardian of the estate related to investing, financial accounting, the expenditure of
79 money and the management of certain other property. Section 27 of this bill makes
80 similar changes concerning the expenditure of money related to a guardian of a
81 protected minor who is not a guardian of the estate of a protected minor. (NRS
82 159A.112) Sections 19, 25-31, 36 and 39 of this bill make various other changes
83 related to the estate of a protected minor.
84 Existing law requires a guardian to notify the court if the guardian is subject to
85 certain disqualifying events. (NRS 159A.1852) Section 32 of this bill removes
86 certain circumstances under which a guardian is required to provide such notice.
87 Existing law authorizes certain persons to petition the court to remove a
88 guardian. (NRS 159A.1853) Section 33 of this bill revises the persons who may file
89 such a petition by removing the authority of a public guardian to file the petition
90 and additionally authorizing an attorney of a protected minor or agency which
91 provides child welfare services to file the petition. Section 37 of this bill requires a
92 court to consider certain factors related to petitions filed by the parent of a
93 protected minor. (NRS 159A.1915)
94 Sections 33, 35, 38 and 40 of this bill revise the remedial actions that can be
95 taken by a court under certain circumstances.
96 Existing law authorizes a court to appoint another guardian when a guardian
97 dies or is removed by an order of the court. (NRS 159A.187) Section 34 of this bill
98 requires the court to provide notice of the matter to an agency which provides child
99 welfare services if a guardian dies or is removed and there is not a qualified
100 guardian or temporary substitute guardian willing to serve.
101 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “agency which provides child welfare
102 services” for the purposes of the provisions of law governing guardianships of
103 minors. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the
104 definition applies to the existing provisions of law.
105 Section 42 of this bill repeals various provisions of law related to the
106 guardianship of minors. Sections 2-4, 8 and 9 of this bill make conforming changes
107 relating to the repeal of such provisions.
