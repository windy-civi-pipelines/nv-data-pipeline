Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to suspend or revoke the
2 license of a teacher, administrator or other licensed employee on certain grounds
3 after notice and an opportunity for hearing. (NRS 391.330) Section 3 of this bill
4 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to place an administrative hold
5 on a license without a hearing, pending further disciplinary proceedings by the
6 State Board, if: (1) the licensee has been arrested for, or charged with, certain
7 crimes or suspended from employment for an act which may be a ground for the
8 suspension or revocation of a license; and (2) the Superintendent of Public
9 Instruction finds that the alleged conduct presents a risk to the health, safety or
10 welfare of pupils. Section 3 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
11 immediately notify the licensee and the State Board that an administrative hold has
12 been placed and transmit a recommendation to maintain the administrative hold.
13 Sections 9-12 of this bill authorize the State Board, after notice and an opportunity
14 for hearing, to maintain an administrative hold on a license pending further
15 disciplinary proceedings, if: (1) a licensee has been arrested for, or charged with,
16 certain crimes or suspended from employment for an act which may be a ground
17 for the suspension or revocation of a license; and (2) the State Board finds that the
18 alleged conduct presents a risk to the health, safety or welfare of pupils. Section 10
19 provides that an administrative hold remains in effect until: (1) removed by the
20 State Board; (2) the license is suspended or revoked; or (3) the administrative hold
21 expires, which occurs 1 year after the administrative hold was originally placed or
22 maintained by the State Board.
23 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a licensee who has an administrative hold
24 placed on his or her license to continue to be employed by a school district or
25 charter school at the discretion of his or her employer, but prohibits the licensee
26 from seeking employment with or being employed by any other school district or
27 charter school in this State while the administrative hold is in effect. Section 12
28 adds a violation of the prohibition in section 4 against seeking employment or
29 being employed by another school district or charter school while an administrative
30 hold is in effect to the list of offenses for which the State Board may suspend or
31 revoke a license. Section 4 also: (1) prohibits an administrative hold from being
32 recorded as a disciplinary action in any permanent employment record; and (2)
33 requires the Department, if an administrative hold is placed, to notify the school
34 district or charter school that employs the licensee and make an entry to that effect
35 in the Educator Identification Clearinghouse maintained by the National
36 Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification or its
37 successor organization.
38 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate provisions of
39 existing law that apply to the suspension or revocation of a license and to an
40 administrative hold on a license. (NRS 391.055, 391.3015)
41 Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits a person licensed by the Superintendent of
42 Public Instruction from engaging in sexual impropriety with, or grooming, certain
43 pupils; (2) defines “sexual impropriety” and “grooming” for the purposes of this
44 prohibition; and (3) provides that consent by a pupil is not a defense to such
45 conduct in a proceeding before the State Board to suspend, revoke or place an
46 administrative hold on a license or in a disciplinary action against a licensed
47 employee of a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly
48 gifted pupils. Section 12 adds a violation of section 2 to the list of offenses for
49 which the State Board may suspend or revoke a license. Section 13 of this bill
50 makes a conforming change to revise an internal reference to a paragraph which
51 was renumbered by section 12.
52 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to grant licenses
53 for teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.033) Sections 5 and 6 of
54 this bill remove the authority of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to issue a
-

55 provisional license to an applicant if, while awaiting receipt of certain reports on
56 the criminal history of an applicant, the Superintendent of Public Instruction
57 determines the applicant is qualified for licensure.

42 chapter, pending further disciplinary proceedings by the State
43 Board pursuant to NRS 391.320 to 391.361, inclusive, and
44 sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act, if:
45 (a) The licensee:
-
*SB59*
– 5 –
1 (1) Is arrested for, or charged with, a crime which may be a
2 ground for the suspension or revocation of the person’s license
3 pursuant to NRS 391.330; or
4 (2) Is suspended from employment for an alleged act that, if
5 proven, may be a ground for the suspension or revocation of the

31 administrative hold is a disciplinary action and may be recorded as
32 such in a permanent employment record.
33 3. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the State
34 Board places an administrative hold on a license issued pursuant
35 to this chapter, the Department shall:
36 (a) Notify the school district or charter school that employs the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to suspend or revoke the
2 license of a teacher, administrator or other licensed employee on certain grounds
3 after notice and an opportunity for hearing. (NRS 391.330) Section 3 of this bill
4 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction to place an administrative hold
5 on a license without a hearing, pending further disciplinary proceedings by the
6 State Board, if: (1) the licensee has been arrested for, or charged with, certain
7 crimes or suspended from employment for an act which may be a ground for the
8 suspension or revocation of a license; and (2) the Superintendent of Public
9 Instruction finds that the alleged conduct presents a risk to the health, safety or
10 welfare of pupils. Section 3 requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
11 immediately notify the licensee and the State Board that an administrative hold has
12 been placed and transmit a recommendation to maintain the administrative hold.
13 Sections 9-12 of this bill authorize the State Board, after notice and an opportunity
14 for hearing, to maintain an administrative hold on a license pending further
15 disciplinary proceedings, if: (1) a licensee has been arrested for, or charged with,
16 certain crimes or suspended from employment for an act which may be a ground
17 for the suspension or revocation of a license; and (2) the State Board finds that the
18 alleged conduct presents a risk to the health, safety or welfare of pupils. Section 10
19 provides that an administrative hold remains in effect until: (1) removed by the
20 State Board; (2) the license is suspended or revoked; or (3) the administrative hold
21 expires, which occurs 1 year after the administrative hold was originally placed or
22 maintained by the State Board.
23 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a licensee who has an administrative hold
24 placed on his or her license to continue to be employed by a school district or
25 charter school at the discretion of his or her employer, but prohibits the licensee
26 from seeking employment with or being employed by any other school district or
27 charter school in this State while the administrative hold is in effect. Section 12
28 adds a violation of the prohibition in section 4 against seeking employment or
29 being employed by another school district or charter school while an administrative
30 hold is in effect to the list of offenses for which the State Board may suspend or
31 revoke a license. Section 4 also: (1) prohibits an administrative hold from being
32 recorded as a disciplinary action in any permanent employment record; and (2)
33 requires the Department, if an administrative hold is placed, to notify the school
34 district or charter school that employs the licensee and make an entry to that effect
35 in the Educator Identification Clearinghouse maintained by the National
36 Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification or its
37 successor organization.
38 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate provisions of
39 existing law that apply to the suspension or revocation of a license and to an
40 administrative hold on a license. (NRS 391.055, 391.3015)
41 Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits a person licensed by the Superintendent of
42 Public Instruction from engaging in sexual impropriety with, or grooming, certain
43 pupils; (2) defines “sexual impropriety” and “grooming” for the purposes of this
44 prohibition; and (3) provides that consent by a pupil is not a defense to such
45 conduct in a proceeding before the State Board to suspend, revoke or place an
46 administrative hold on a license or in a disciplinary action against a licensed
47 employee of a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly
48 gifted pupils. Section 12 adds a violation of section 2 to the list of offenses for
49 which the State Board may suspend or revoke a license. Section 13 of this bill
50 makes a conforming change to revise an internal reference to a paragraph which
51 was renumbered by section 12.
52 Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to grant licenses
53 for teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.033) Sections 5 and 6 of
54 this bill remove the authority of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to issue a
-

– 3 –
55 provisional license to an applicant if, while awaiting receipt of certain reports on
56 the criminal history of an applicant, the Superintendent of Public Instruction
57 determines the applicant is qualified for licensure.

12 months;
13 (c) Who is or was enrolled in or attending a public school or
14 private school while the licensee was employed at that public

16 at that public school or private school for a period of less than 12
17 months; or
18 (d) With whom the licensee has had contact in the course of
19 performing his or her duties as a licensee if:
