benefits for Medicaid and certain other health benefit
plans; requiring the Department to establish certain
methodologies for the payment of and rates of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
2 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance
3 organization to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for
4 Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and certain other health benefit
-
*SB389_R2*
– 2 –
5 plans that elect to use the list of preferred prescription drugs established for
6 Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)
7 Sections 12 and 15 of this bill instead require the Department to, not later than
8 January 1, 2030, select and enter into a contract with one pharmacy benefit
9 manager, known as the state pharmacy benefit manager, to manage all such
10 coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe certain
11 required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill prescribes the required
12 contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
13 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the criteria
14 that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to serve as the state pharmacy
15 benefit manager; and (2) certain methodologies and requirements relating to the
16 reimbursement and payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract
17 between the Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
18 requires the methodology established for the reimbursement of certain pharmacies
19 to: (1) be developed in a manner which would provide the greatest amount of
20 savings to the State; and (2) base the rate of reimbursement for a drug on the actual
21 cost of acquiring the drug. For that purpose, section 5 also requires the Department
22 to, if certain conditions are met, establish a benchmark to measure the price of
23 drugs purchased in this State directly from manufacturers and wholesalers, which is
24 to be known as the Nevada Average Acquisition Cost. Section 5 requires the
25 Department to biennially submit a report to the Legislature concerning the savings
26 realized by the State from the establishment and use of the Nevada Average
27 Acquisition Cost benchmark.
28 Section 8 of this bill requires each Medicaid managed care organization to
29 contract with and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to administer all
30 pharmacy benefits for recipients of Medicaid who receive such benefits through the
31 Medicaid managed care organization. Section 8 also requires each Medicaid
32 managed care organization to, upon request of the Department, disclose the
33 expenditures of the Medicaid managed care organization associated with providing
34 pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid.
35 Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract
36 between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that
37 contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
38 under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
39 Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract between
40 the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the contract,
41 revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
42 the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply
43 with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
44 manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the
45 obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.
46 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
47 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies
48 certain other definitions in existing law to sections 4-6. Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14
49 of this bill make conforming changes to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy
50 benefit manager and revise certain references in accordance with the provisions of
51 this bill.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
2 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance
3 organization to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for
4 Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and certain other health benefit
-

– 2 –
5 plans that elect to use the list of preferred prescription drugs established for
6 Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)
7 Sections 12 and 15 of this bill instead require the Department to, not later than
8 January 1, 2030, select and enter into a contract with one pharmacy benefit
9 manager, known as the state pharmacy benefit manager, to manage all such
10 coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe certain
11 required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill prescribes the required
12 contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
13 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the criteria
14 that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to serve as the state pharmacy
15 benefit manager; and (2) certain methodologies and requirements relating to the
16 reimbursement and payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract
17 between the Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
18 requires the methodology established for the reimbursement of certain pharmacies
19 to: (1) be developed in a manner which would provide the greatest amount of
20 savings to the State; and (2) base the rate of reimbursement for a drug on the actual
21 cost of acquiring the drug. For that purpose, section 5 also requires the Department
22 to, if certain conditions are met, establish a benchmark to measure the price of
23 drugs purchased in this State directly from manufacturers and wholesalers, which is
24 to be known as the Nevada Average Acquisition Cost. Section 5 requires the
25 Department to biennially submit a report to the Legislature concerning the savings
26 realized by the State from the establishment and use of the Nevada Average
27 Acquisition Cost benchmark.
28 Section 8 of this bill requires each Medicaid managed care organization to
29 contract with and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to administer all
30 pharmacy benefits for recipients of Medicaid who receive such benefits through the
31 Medicaid managed care organization. Section 8 also requires each Medicaid
32 managed care organization to, upon request of the Department, disclose the
33 expenditures of the Medicaid managed care organization associated with providing
34 pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid.
35 Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract
36 between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that
37 contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
38 under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
39 Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract between
40 the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the contract,
41 revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
42 the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply
43 with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
44 manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the
45 obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.
46 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
47 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies
48 certain other definitions in existing law to sections 4-6. Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14
49 of this bill make conforming changes to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy
50 benefit manager and revise certain references in accordance with the provisions of
51 this bill.
