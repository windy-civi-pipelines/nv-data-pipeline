Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
2 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance
3 organization to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for
4 Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and certain other health benefit
5 plans that elect to use the list of preferred prescription drugs established for
6 Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)
7 Sections 12 and 15 of this bill instead require the Department to, not later than
8 January 1, 2030, select and enter into a contract with one pharmacy benefit
9 manager, known as the state pharmacy benefit manager, to manage all such
10 coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe certain
11 required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill prescribes the required
12 contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
13 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the criteria
14 that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to serve as the state pharmacy
15 benefit manager; and (2) certain methodologies and requirements relating to the
16 reimbursement and payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract
17 between the Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
18 requires the methodology established for the reimbursement of certain pharmacies
19 to: (1) be developed in a manner which would provide the greatest amount of
20 savings to the State; and (2) base the rate of reimbursement for a drug on the actual
21 cost of acquiring the drug. For that purpose, section 5 also requires the Department
22 to, if certain conditions are met, establish a benchmark to measure the price of
23 drugs purchased in this State directly from manufacturers and wholesalers, which is
24 to be known as the Nevada Average Drug Acquisition Cost. Section 5 requires the
25 Department to annually submit a report to the Legislature concerning the savings
26 realized by the State from the establishment and use of the Nevada Average Drug
27 Acquisition Cost benchmark.
28 Section 8 of this bill requires each Medicaid managed care organization to
29 contract with and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to administer all
30 pharmacy benefits for recipients of Medicaid who receive such benefits through the
31 Medicaid managed care organization. Section 8 also requires each Medicaid
32 managed care organization to, upon request of the Department, disclose the
33 expenditures of the Medicaid managed care organization associated with providing
34 pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid. Sections 8 and 12 additionally
35 preserve the ability of the Department to contract with a Medicaid managed care
36 organization to administer pharmacy benefits, with respect to prescription drugs
37 which are not on the list of preferred prescription drugs established for Medicaid
38 and for which the state pharmacy benefit manager has not entered into an
39 agreement to purchase for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
40 Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract
41 between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that
42 contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
43 under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
44 Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract between
45 the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the contract,
46 revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
47 the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply
48 with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
49 manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the
50 obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.
51 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
52 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies
53 certain other definitions in existing law to sections 4-6. Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14
54 of this bill make conforming changes to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy
