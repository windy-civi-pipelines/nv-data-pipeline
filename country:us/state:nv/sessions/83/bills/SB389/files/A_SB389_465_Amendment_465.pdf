AN ACT relating to prescription drugs; requiring the Department of Health and
Human Services to select and contract with a state pharmacy benefit
manager to manage pharmacy benefits for Medicaid and certain other
health benefit plans; requiring the Department to establish certain
methodologies for the payment of and rates of reimbursement for
prescription drugs under Medicaid; requiring the Department to
establish a benchmark to measure certain data relating to the cost
of prescription drugs; prescribing certain duties of the state pharmacy
benefit manager; requiring that the Department approve certain
contracts entered into by the state pharmacy benefit manager;
prohibiting the state pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in
certain activities; requiring a Medicaid managed care organization to
contract with and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to manage
certain pharmacy benefits; establishing certain requirements for a
Medicaid managed care organization that manages coverage for
prescription drugs not on the list of preferred drugs established by
the Department; requiring a Medicaid managed care organization to
provide certain information to the Department upon request; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into a
2 contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance organization to manage
3 coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for Medicaid, the Children’s Health
4 Insurance Program and certain other health benefit plans that elect to use the list of preferred
5 prescription drugs established for Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)
6 Sections 12 and 15 of this bill instead require the Department to, not later than January 1,
7 2030, select and enter into a contract with one pharmacy benefit manager, known as the state
8 pharmacy benefit manager, to manage all such coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 12
9 and 13 of this bill prescribe certain required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill
10 prescribes the required contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit

Senate Amendment No. 465 to Senate Bill No. 389 Page 4
11 manager. Section 5 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations establishing: (1)
12 the criteria that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to serve as the state pharmacy
13 benefit manager; and (2) certain methodologies and requirements relating to the
14 reimbursement and payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract between
15 the Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5 requires the methodology
16 established for the reimbursement of certain pharmacies to: (1) be developed in a
17 manner which would provide the greatest amount of savings to the State; and (2) base
18 the rate of reimbursement for a drug on the actual cost of acquiring the drug. For that
19 purpose, section 5 also requires the Department to, if certain conditions are met,
20 establish a benchmark to measure the price of drugs purchased in this State directly
21 from manufacturers and wholesalers, which is to be known as the Nevada Average Drug
22 Acquisition Cost. Section 5 requires the Department to annually submit a report to the
23 Legislature concerning the savings realized by the State from the establishment and use
24 of the Nevada Average Drug Acquisition Cost benchmark.
25 Section 8 of this bill requires each Medicaid managed care organization to contract with
26 and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to administer all pharmacy benefits for
27 recipients of Medicaid who receive such benefits through the Medicaid managed care
28 organization. Section 8 also requires each Medicaid managed care organization to, upon
29 request of the Department, disclose the expenditures of the Medicaid managed care
30 organization associated with providing pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid. Sections
31 8 and 12 additionally preserve the ability of the Department to contract with a Medicaid
32 managed care organization to administer pharmacy benefits, with respect to
33 prescription drugs which are not on the list of preferred prescription drugs established
34 for Medicaid and for which the state pharmacy benefit manager has not entered into an
35 agreement to purchase for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
36 Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract between the state
37 pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that contracts on behalf of a pharmacy
38 if the contract is for the provision of benefits under the contract between the state pharmacy
39 benefit manager and the Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a
40 contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the
41 contract, revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
42 the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply with federal
43 requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit manager from entering
44 into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the obligations of the state pharmacy
45 benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.
46 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill establishes the
47 applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies certain other definitions in
48 existing law to sections 4-6. Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14 of this bill make conforming changes
49 to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy benefit manager and revise certain references in
50 accordance with the provisions of this bill.
