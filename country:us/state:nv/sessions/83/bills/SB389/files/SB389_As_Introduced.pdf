20 such benefits through the Medicaid managed care organization. Section 8 also
21 requires each Medicaid managed care organization to, upon request of the

23 associated with providing pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid.
24 Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract

26 contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
27 under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
28 Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract between
29 the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the contract,
30 revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
31 the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply
32 with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
33 manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the
34 obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.
35 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
36 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies
