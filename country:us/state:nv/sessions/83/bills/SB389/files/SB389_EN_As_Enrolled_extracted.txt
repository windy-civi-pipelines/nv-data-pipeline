AN ACT relating to prescription drugs; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to select and contract with a state
pharmacy benefit manager to manage pharmacy benefits for
Medicaid and certain other health benefit plans; requiring the
Department to establish certain methodologies for the
payment of and rates of reimbursement for prescription drugs
under Medicaid; requiring the Department to establish a

prescription drugs; prescribing certain duties of the state
pharmacy benefit manager; requiring that the Department

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance
organization to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for
Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and certain other health benefit
plans that elect to use the list of preferred prescription drugs established for
Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)

Section 2:
Sections 12 and 15 of this bill instead require the Department to, not later than
January 1, 2030, select and enter into a contract with one pharmacy benefit
manager, known as the state pharmacy benefit manager, to manage all such
coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe certain
required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill prescribes the required
contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the criteria
that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to serve as the state pharmacy
benefit manager; and (2) certain methodologies and requirements relating to the
reimbursement and payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract
between the Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
requires the methodology established for the reimbursement of certain pharmacies
to: (1) be developed in a manner which would provide the greatest amount of
savings to the State; and (2) base the rate of reimbursement for a drug on the actual
cost of acquiring the drug. For that purpose, section 5 also requires the Department
to, if certain conditions are met, establish a benchmark to measure the price of
drugs purchased in this State directly from manufacturers and wholesalers, which is
to be known as the Nevada Average Acquisition Cost. Section 5 requires the
Department to biennially submit a report to the Legislature concerning the savings

Section 8 of this bill requires each Medicaid managed care organization to
contract with and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to administer all
pharmacy benefits for recipients of Medicaid who receive such benefits through the
Medicaid managed care organization. Section 8 also requires each Medicaid
managed care organization to, upon request of the Department, disclose the
expenditures of the Medicaid managed care organization associated with providing
pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid.

Section 4:
Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract
between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that
contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract between
the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the contract,
revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply
with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the
obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.

Section 5:
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies
certain other definitions in existing law to sections 4-6. Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14
of this bill make conforming changes to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy
benefit manager and revise certain references in accordance with the provisions of
this bill.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 389–Senators Scheible, Stone; and Daly
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to prescription drugs; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to select and contract with a state
pharmacy benefit manager to manage pharmacy benefits for
Medicaid and certain other health benefit plans; requiring the
Department to establish certain methodologies for the
payment of and rates of reimbursement for prescription drugs
under Medicaid; requiring the Department to establish a
benchmark to measure certain data relating to the cost of
prescription drugs; prescribing certain duties of the state
pharmacy benefit manager; requiring that the Department
approve certain contracts entered into by the state pharmacy
benefit manager; prohibiting the state pharmacy benefit
manager from engaging in certain activities; requiring a
Medicaid managed care organization to contract with and
utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to manage
pharmacy benefits; requiring a Medicaid managed care
organization to provide certain information to the Department
upon request; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance
organization to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for
Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and certain other health benefit
plans that elect to use the list of preferred prescription drugs established for
Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)
Sections 12 and 15 of this bill instead require the Department to, not later than
January 1, 2030, select and enter into a contract with one pharmacy benefit
manager, known as the state pharmacy benefit manager, to manage all such
coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe certain
required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill prescribes the required
contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations establishing: (1) the criteria
that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to serve as the state pharmacy
benefit manager; and (2) certain methodologies and requirements relating to the
reimbursement and payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract
between the Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 5
requires the methodology established for the reimbursement of certain pharmacies
to: (1) be developed in a manner which would provide the greatest amount of
savings to the State; and (2) base the rate of reimbursement for a drug on the actual
cost of acquiring the drug. For that purpose, section 5 also requires the Department
to, if certain conditions are met, establish a benchmark to measure the price of
drugs purchased in this State directly from manufacturers and wholesalers, which is
to be known as the Nevada Average Acquisition Cost. Section 5 requires the
Department to biennially submit a report to the Legislature concerning the savings
-

realized by the State from the establishment and use of the Nevada Average
Acquisition Cost benchmark.
Section 8 of this bill requires each Medicaid managed care organization to
contract with and utilize the state pharmacy benefit manager to administer all
pharmacy benefits for recipients of Medicaid who receive such benefits through the
Medicaid managed care organization. Section 8 also requires each Medicaid
managed care organization to, upon request of the Department, disclose the
expenditures of the Medicaid managed care organization associated with providing
pharmacy benefits to recipients of Medicaid.
Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract
between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that
contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract between
the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy, in order for the contract,
revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6 also authorizes
the Department to change certain payment arrangements as necessary to comply
with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that conflicts with the
obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the provisions of this bill.
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 7 of this bill
establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 9 of this bill applies
certain other definitions in existing law to sections 4-6. Sections 10, 11, 13 and 14
of this bill make conforming changes to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy
benefit manager and revise certain references in accordance with the provisions of
this bill.
