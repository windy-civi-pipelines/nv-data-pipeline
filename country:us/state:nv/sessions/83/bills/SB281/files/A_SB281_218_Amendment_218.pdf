part of an extended youth support services plan with the consent of the
participant;] requiring an allocation from the Fund for a Resilient
Nevada for a program for certain young adults; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law : (1) creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
2 certain litigation by the State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or
3 marketing of opioids; and (2) provides for the use of the money in the Fund for statewide
4 projects and distribution as grants to address the impacts of opioid use disorder and
5 other substance use disorders. (NRS 433.732-433.740) Existing law requires the [Division
6 of Child and Family Services] Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
7 [establish and administer the Extended Young Adult Support Services Program to provide
8 extended support services to certain young adults. (NRS 432B.5919) Existing law further
9 requires the agency which provides child welfare services to, upon the request of a young
10 adult who is eligible to participate in the Program, develop a written extended youth support
11 services plan to assist the young adult in transitioning to self-sufficiency. Existing law: (1)
12 authorizes such a plan to provide for the agency which provides child welfare services to
13 make direct payments to certain persons or entities; and (2) based on the needs of a
14 participant, authorizes the agency which provides child welfare services to, at any time, after
15 consulting with the participant, revise the persons or entities to whom such a payment is made
16 and the manner in which payments are allocated between such persons or entities. (NRS
17 432B.595) This bill instead authorizes an agency which provides child welfare services to
18 make such revisions with the consent of the participant.] administer the Fund. (NRS
19 433.732) Section 3 of this bill requires the Director to make an allocation of $2,500,000
20 from the Fund to the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department for use
21 during the 2025-2027 biennium for a program to support persons who are 18 years of
22 age and older but less than 23 years of age and are transitioning from foster care to
23 independent living.
