use of money in the Account to reimburse cities and
counties for the cost of reducing or subsidizing certain
fees to assist in maintaining or developing a project for
affordable housing; making an appropriation to the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a planning commission to adopt a master plan for the
2 physical development of the city, county or region served by the planning
3 commission, and the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt all or
4 part of a master plan for use as a basis for the development of the city, county or
5 region. (NRS 278.150) Under existing law, the master plan adopted by the
6 governing body of certain cities and counties is required to include a housing
7 element, which includes certain information relating to housing. (NRS 278.150,
8 278.160) If the governing body of a city or county is required to include the
9 housing element in its master plan, existing law requires the governing body to
10 adopt at least six of the measures for maintaining and developing affordable
11 housing which are listed in statute. (NRS 278.235) One such measure which the
12 governing body of a city or county is authorized to adopt to meet this requirement
13 is reducing or subsidizing in whole or in part impact fees, certain fees for the
-

– 2 –
14 issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the purpose for which an
15 enterprise fund was created. (NRS 278.235)
16 Sections 1-3 of this bill establish a process for a city or county to request
17 reimbursement from the State for the cost of reducing or subsidizing such fees.
18 Section 2 creates the Account for Housing Expansion Through Local Partnerships
19 in the State General Fund and sets forth provisions governing the administration of
20 the Account. Section 3 authorizes a city or county to submit a request to the
21 Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry for reimbursement
22 from the Account for the cost of reducing or subsidizing such fees. Section 3
23 requires the Division to transmit requests which the Division determines should be
24 approved to the State Board of Examiners. Under section 3, if the State Board of
25 Examiners determines that an allocation from the Account should be made, the
26 State Board of Examiners is required to recommend the allocation to the Interim
27 Finance Committee for its independent evaluation and action. Sections 2 and 3
28 require approval from the Interim Finance Committee before any distribution from
29 the Account is made.
30 Except under certain circumstances, existing law prohibits the Interim Finance
31 Committee from exercising the powers conferred upon it when the Legislature is in
32 a regular or special session. (NRS 218E.405) Section 4 of this bill authorizes the
33 Interim Finance Committee to perform the duties imposed on it by section 3 during
34 a regular or special session of the Legislature.
35 Section 5 of this bill appropriates $20,000,000 to the Account for the purpose
