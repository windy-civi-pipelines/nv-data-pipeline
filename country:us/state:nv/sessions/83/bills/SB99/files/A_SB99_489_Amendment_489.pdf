AN ACT relating to housing; authorizing the governing body of a city or county in
certain regions to impose, under certain circumstances, a linkage fee on
certain developers to pay for certain expenses related to the
development of affordable housing; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to regulate and restrict the
2 improvement of land, taking into account the availability of and need for affordable housing
3 in the community. (NRS 278.020) Existing law further requires the governing bodies of
4 certain cities and counties to: (1) ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing when
5 implementing a master plan; (2) adopt certain measures to maintain and develop affordable
6 housing to carry out the housing plan required in the master plan; and (3) report certain
7 information relating to affordable housing to certain entities. (NRS 278.230, 278.235,
8 278.237) Existing law also authorizes the governing body of a city or county to adopt zoning
9 regulations that, in relevant part, ensure the development of an adequate supply of affordable
10 housing in the community. In exercising such power, the governing body of the city or county
11 is authorized to use any controls relating to land use or principles of zoning that the governing
12 body determines to be appropriate, including, without limitation, density bonuses,
13 inclusionary zoning and minimum density zoning. (NRS 278.250)
14 Existing law creates the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency as part of the Tahoe Regional
15 Planning Compact and sets forth certain provisions regarding the governance of the Lake
16 Tahoe region by the Agency, including provisions relating to the creation, review and
17 amendment of a regional plan. (NRS 277.200)
18 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of a city
19 or county which is located within any region governed by a regional planning agency created
20 by interstate compact (currently the Lake Tahoe region) to impose a linkage fee [on the
21 development of residential units in the city or county which are 1,000 square feet or more] if

Senate Amendment No. 489 to Senate Bill No. 99 Page 4
22 the regional plan adopted by such a regional planning agency [: (1)] calls for the development
23 of affordable housing in the region [;] and [(2)] identifies the use of linkage fees and deed
24 restrictions as tools for the development of affordable housing [.] on the: (1) development of
25 any residential units in the city or county which are 1,000 square feet or more; (2)
26 construction of any addition to existing residential units which are 750 square feet or
27 more; and (3) remodeling of any residential units if the value of the remodeling is
28 estimated to be more than $100,000. Section 1 further: (1) requires such fees to be used for
29 the purpose of paying certain fees to assist in the development of affordable housing units of a
30 certain size which must be not more than 1,000 square feet per unit and subject to a deed
31 restriction that requires the units to be sold or rented as affordable housing; and (2) prohibits
32 such fees from being imposed on the development of residential units for affordable housing
33 [.] and certain construction or remodeling relating to accessory dwelling units that are or
34 will be subject to a deed restriction that requires the units to be sold or rented as
35 affordable housing. Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
36 planning and zoning, including the definition for “affordable housing,” to the provisions of
37 section 1. Section 4 of this bill provides that the powers granted by section 1 are subordinate
38 to the powers of a regional planning agency created by interstate compact. Section 3 of this
39 bill applies certain provisions relating to judicial relief from or review of any final action,
40 decisions or order of a governing body to an action or proceeding which arises from the
41 provisions of section 1.
