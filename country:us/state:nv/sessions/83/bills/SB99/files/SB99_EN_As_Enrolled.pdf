Senate Bill No. 99–Committee on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to housing; authorizing the governing body of a
city or county in certain regions to impose, under certain
circumstances, a linkage fee on certain developers to pay for
certain expenses related to the development of affordable
housing; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to regulate and
restrict the improvement of land, taking into account the availability of and need for
affordable housing in the community. (NRS 278.020) Existing law further requires
the governing bodies of certain cities and counties to: (1) ensure an adequate supply
of affordable housing when implementing a master plan; (2) adopt certain measures
to maintain and develop affordable housing to carry out the housing plan required
in the master plan; and (3) report certain information relating to affordable housing
to certain entities. (NRS 278.230, 278.235, 278.237) Existing law also authorizes
the governing body of a city or county to adopt zoning regulations that, in relevant
part, ensure the development of an adequate supply of affordable housing in the
community. In exercising such power, the governing body of the city or county is
authorized to use any controls relating to land use or principles of zoning that the
governing body determines to be appropriate, including, without limitation, density
bonuses, inclusionary zoning and minimum density zoning. (NRS 278.250)
Existing law creates the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency as part of the Tahoe
Regional Planning Compact and sets forth certain provisions regarding the
governance of the Lake Tahoe region by the Agency, including provisions relating
to the creation, review and amendment of a regional plan. (NRS 277.200)
Section 1 of this bill authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing
body of a city or county which is located within any region governed by a regional
planning agency created by interstate compact (currently the Lake Tahoe region) to
impose a linkage fee if the regional plan adopted by such a regional planning
agency calls for the development of affordable housing in the region and identifies
the use of linkage fees and deed restrictions as tools for the development of
affordable housing on the: (1) development of any residential units in the city or
county which are 1,000 square feet or more; (2) construction of any addition to
existing residential units which are 750 square feet or more; and (3) remodeling of
any residential units if the value of the remodeling is estimated to be more than
$100,000. Section 1 further: (1) requires such fees to be used for the purpose of
paying certain fees to assist in the development of affordable housing units of a
certain size which must be not more than 1,000 square feet per unit and subject to a
deed restriction that requires the units to be sold or rented as affordable housing;
and (2) prohibits such fees from being imposed on the development of residential
units for affordable housing and certain construction or remodeling relating to
accessory dwelling units that are or will be subject to a deed restriction that requires
the units to be sold or rented as affordable housing. Section 2 of this bill applies the
definitions in existing law relating to planning and zoning, including the definition
for “affordable housing,” to the provisions of section 1. Section 4 of this bill
provides that the powers granted by section 1 are subordinate to the powers of a
regional planning agency created by interstate compact. Section 3 of this bill
applies certain provisions relating to judicial relief from or review of any final
