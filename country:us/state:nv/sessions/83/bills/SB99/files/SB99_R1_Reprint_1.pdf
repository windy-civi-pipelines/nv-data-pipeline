AN ACT relating to housing; authorizing the governing body of a
city or county in certain regions to impose, under certain
circumstances, a linkage fee on certain developers to pay

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to regulate and
2 restrict the improvement of land, taking into account the availability of and need for
3 affordable housing in the community. (NRS 278.020) Existing law further requires
4 the governing bodies of certain cities and counties to: (1) ensure an adequate supply
5 of affordable housing when implementing a master plan; (2) adopt certain measures
6 to maintain and develop affordable housing to carry out the housing plan required
7 in the master plan; and (3) report certain information relating to affordable housing
8 to certain entities. (NRS 278.230, 278.235, 278.237) Existing law also authorizes
9 the governing body of a city or county to adopt zoning regulations that, in relevant
10 part, ensure the development of an adequate supply of affordable housing in the
11 community. In exercising such power, the governing body of the city or county is
12 authorized to use any controls relating to land use or principles of zoning that the
13 governing body determines to be appropriate, including, without limitation, density
14 bonuses, inclusionary zoning and minimum density zoning. (NRS 278.250)
15 Existing law creates the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency as part of the Tahoe
16 Regional Planning Compact and sets forth certain provisions regarding the

17 governance of the Lake Tahoe region by the Agency, including provisions relating
18 to the creation, review and amendment of a regional plan. (NRS 277.200)
19 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing
20 body of a city or county which is located within any region governed by a regional
21 planning agency created by interstate compact (currently the Lake Tahoe region) to
22 impose a linkage fee if the regional plan adopted by such a regional planning
23 agency calls for the development of affordable housing in the region and identifies
24 the use of linkage fees and deed restrictions as tools for the development of
25 affordable housing on the: (1) development of any residential units in the city or
26 county which are 1,000 square feet or more; (2) construction of any addition to
27 existing residential units which are 750 square feet or more; and (3) remodeling of
28 any residential units if the value of the remodeling is estimated to be more than
29 $100,000. Section 1 further: (1) requires such fees to be used for the purpose of
30 paying certain fees to assist in the development of affordable housing units of a
31 certain size which must be not more than 1,000 square feet per unit and subject to a
32 deed restriction that requires the units to be sold or rented as affordable housing;
33 and (2) prohibits such fees from being imposed on the development of residential
34 units for affordable housing and certain construction or remodeling relating to
35 accessory dwelling units that are or will be subject to a deed restriction that requires
36 the units to be sold or rented as affordable housing. Section 2 of this bill applies the
37 definitions in existing law relating to planning and zoning, including the definition
38 for “affordable housing,” to the provisions of section 1. Section 4 of this bill
39 provides that the powers granted by section 1 are subordinate to the powers of a
40 regional planning agency created by interstate compact. Section 3 of this bill
41 applies certain provisions relating to judicial relief from or review of any final
42 action, decisions or order of a governing body to an action or proceeding which
43 arises from the provisions of section 1.
