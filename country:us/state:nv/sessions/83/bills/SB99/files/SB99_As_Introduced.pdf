relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to regulate and
2 restrict the improvement of land, taking into account the availability of and need for
3 affordable housing in the community. (NRS 278.020) Existing law further requires
4 the governing bodies of certain cities and counties to: (1) ensure an adequate supply
5 of affordable housing when implementing a master plan; (2) adopt certain measures
6 to maintain and develop affordable housing to carry out the housing plan required
7 in the master plan; and (3) report certain information relating to affordable housing
8 to certain entities. (NRS 278.230, 278.235, 278.237) Existing law also authorizes
9 the governing body of a city or county to adopt zoning regulations that, in relevant
10 part, ensure the development of an adequate supply of affordable housing in the
11 community. In exercising such power, the governing body of the city or county is
12 authorized to use any controls relating to land use or principles of zoning that the
13 governing body determines to be appropriate, including, without limitation, density
14 bonuses, inclusionary zoning and minimum density zoning. (NRS 278.250)
15 Existing law creates the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency as part of the Tahoe
16 Regional Planning Compact and sets forth certain provisions regarding the
-

17 governance of the Lake Tahoe region by the Agency, including provisions relating
18 to the creation, review and amendment of a regional plan. (NRS 277.200)
19 Section 1 of this bill authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing
20 body of a city or county which is located within any region governed by a regional
21 planning agency created by interstate compact (currently the Lake Tahoe region) to
22 impose a linkage fee on the development of residential units in the city or county
23 which are 1,000 square feet or more if the regional plan adopted by such a regional
24 planning agency: (1) calls for the development of affordable housing in the region;
25 and (2) identifies the use of linkage fees and deed restrictions as tools for the
26 development of affordable housing. Section 1 further: (1) requires such fees to be
27 used for the purpose of paying certain fees to assist in the development of
28 affordable housing units of a certain size which must be not more than 1,000 square
29 feet per unit and subject to a deed restriction that requires the units to be sold or
30 rented as affordable housing; and (2) prohibits such fees from being imposed on the
31 development of residential units for affordable housing. Section 2 of this bill
32 applies the definitions in existing law relating to planning and zoning, including the
33 definition for “affordable housing,” to the provisions of section 1. Section 4 of this
34 bill provides that the powers granted by section 1 are subordinate to the powers of a
35 regional planning agency created by interstate compact. Section 3 of this bill
36 applies certain provisions relating to judicial relief from or review of any final
37 action, decisions or order of a governing body to an action or proceeding which
38 arises from the provisions of section 1.

10 within the region that is governed by the regional planning agency
11 may impose a linkage fee on the development of any residential
12 units in the city or county which are 1,000 square feet or more to
13 assist in the development of affordable housing that the governing
14 body determines will be necessary as a result of the development of
