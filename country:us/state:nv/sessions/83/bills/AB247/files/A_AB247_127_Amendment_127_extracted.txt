THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 241.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 241.020 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, all meetings of
3 public bodies must be open and public, and all persons must be permitted to attend
4 any meeting of these public bodies at a physical location or by means of a remote
5 technology system. A meeting that is closed pursuant to a specific statute may only
6 be closed to the extent specified in the statute allowing the meeting to be closed. All
7 other portions of the meeting must be open and public, and the public body must
8 comply with all other provisions of this chapter to the extent not specifically
9 precluded by the specific statute. Public officers and employees responsible for
10 these meetings shall make reasonable efforts to assist and accommodate persons
11 with physical disabilities desiring to attend [.] , including, without limitation,

22 reached maximum capacity if reasonable efforts were taken to accommodate the
23 anticipated number of attendees. Nothing in this subsection requires a public body

1 to NRS 241.0365, by placing the term “for possible corrective action” next to the
2 appropriate item.

19 comments, but may not restrict comments based upon viewpoint.
20 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology system pursuant
21 to NRS 241.023 and does not have a physical location designated for the meeting
22 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate, clear
23 and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in to

53 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

Assembly Amendment No. 127 to Assembly Bill No. 247 Page 4
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 241.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 241.020 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, all meetings of
3 public bodies must be open and public, and all persons must be permitted to attend
4 any meeting of these public bodies at a physical location or by means of a remote
5 technology system. A meeting that is closed pursuant to a specific statute may only
6 be closed to the extent specified in the statute allowing the meeting to be closed. All
7 other portions of the meeting must be open and public, and the public body must
8 comply with all other provisions of this chapter to the extent not specifically
9 precluded by the specific statute. Public officers and employees responsible for
10 these meetings shall make reasonable efforts to assist and accommodate persons
11 with physical disabilities desiring to attend [.] , including, without limitation,
12 providing at public meetings:
13 (a) [A] In person or by electronic means, a person who is [registered to
14 engage in the practice of sign language interpreting pursuant to chapter 656A of
15 NRS;] a qualified interpreter, as defined in 28 C.F.R. § 35.104; and
16 (b) Communication Access Realtime Translation.
17 2. If any portion of a meeting is open to the public, the public officers and
18 employees responsible for the meeting must make reasonable efforts to ensure the
19 facilities for the meeting are large enough to accommodate the anticipated number
20 of attendees. No violation of this chapter occurs if a member of the public is not
21 permitted to attend a public meeting because the facilities for the meeting have
22 reached maximum capacity if reasonable efforts were taken to accommodate the
23 anticipated number of attendees. Nothing in this subsection requires a public body
24 to incur any costs to secure a facility outside the control or jurisdiction of the public
25 body or to upgrade, improve or otherwise modify an existing facility to
26 accommodate the anticipated number of attendees.
27 3. Except in an emergency, written notice of all meetings must be given at
28 least 3 working days before the meeting. The notice must include:
29 (a) The time, place and location of the meeting. If the meeting is held using a
30 remote technology system pursuant to NRS 241.023 and has no physical location,
31 the notice must include information on how a member of the public may:
32 (1) Use the remote technology system to hear and observe the meeting;
33 (2) Participate in the meeting by telephone; and
34 (3) Provide live public comment during the meeting and, if authorized by
35 the public body, provide prerecorded public comment.
36 (b) A list of the locations where the notice has been posted.
37 (c) The name, contact information and business address for the person
38 designated by the public body from whom a member of the public may request the
39 supporting material for the meeting described in subsection 7 and:
40 (1) A list of the locations where the supporting material is available to the
41 public; or
42 (2) Information about how the supporting material may be found on the
43 Internet website of the public body.
44 (d) An agenda consisting of:
45 (1) A clear and complete statement of the topics scheduled to be
46 considered during the meeting.
47 (2) A list describing the items on which action may be taken and clearly
48 denoting that action may be taken on those items by placing the term “for possible
49 action” next to the appropriate item or, if the item is placed on the agenda pursuant

Assembly Amendment No. 127 to Assembly Bill No. 247 Page 5
1 to NRS 241.0365, by placing the term “for possible corrective action” next to the
2 appropriate item.
3 (3) Periods devoted to comments by the general public, if any, and
4 discussion of those comments.
5 (4) If any portion of the meeting will be closed to consider the character,
6 alleged misconduct or professional competence of a person, the name of the person
7 whose character, alleged misconduct or professional competence will be
8 considered.
9 (5) If, during any portion of the meeting, the public body will consider
10 whether to take administrative action regarding a person, the name of that person.
11 (6) Notification that:
12 (I) Items on the agenda may be taken out of order;
13 (II) The public body may combine two or more agenda items for
14 consideration; and
15 (III) The public body may remove an item from the agenda or delay
16 discussion relating to an item on the agenda at any time.
17 (7) Any restrictions on comments by the general public. Any such
18 restrictions must be reasonable and may restrict the time, place and manner of the
19 comments, but may not restrict comments based upon viewpoint.
20 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology system pursuant
21 to NRS 241.023 and does not have a physical location designated for the meeting
22 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate, clear
23 and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in to
24 the meeting to provide public comment, including, without limitation, a telephone
25 number and any necessary identification number of the meeting or other access
26 code.
27 4. Minimum public notice is:
28 (a) Posting a copy of the notice at the principal office of the public body or, if
29 the meeting has a physical location, at the building in which the meeting is to be
30 held. If the meeting is held using a remote technology system pursuant to NRS
31 241.023 and has no physical location, the public body must also post the notice to
32 the Internet website of the public body not later than 9 a.m. of the third working day
33 before the meeting is to be held unless the public body is unable to do so because of
34 technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of the Internet website
35 of the public body.
36 (b) Posting the notice on the official website of the State pursuant to NRS
37 232.2175 not later than 9 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting is to be

39 relating to the operation or maintenance of the official website of the State.
40 (c) Providing a copy of the notice to any person who has requested notice of
41 the meetings of the public body. A request for notice lapses 6 months after it is
42 made. The public body shall inform the requester of this fact by enclosure with,
43 notation upon or text included within the first notice sent. The notice must be:
44 (1) Delivered to the postal service used by the public body not later than 9
45 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting for transmittal to the requester by
46 regular mail; or
47 (2) Transmitted to the requester by electronic mail sent not later than 9
48 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting.
49 5. For each of its meetings, a public body shall document in writing that the
50 public body complied with the minimum public notice required by paragraph (a) of
51 subsection 4. The documentation must be prepared by every person who posted a
52 copy of the public notice and include, without limitation:
53 (a) The date and time when the person posted the copy of the public notice;

Assembly Amendment No. 127 to Assembly Bill No. 247 Page 6
1 (b) The address of the location where the person posted the copy of the public
2 notice; and
3 (c) The name, title and signature of the person who posted the copy of the
4 notice.
5 6. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of subsection 4, if a public
6 body maintains a website on the Internet or its successor, the public body shall post
7 notice of each of its meetings on its website unless the public body is unable to do
8 so because of technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of its
9 website. Notice posted pursuant to this subsection is supplemental to and is not a
10 substitute for the minimum public notice required pursuant to subsection 4. The
11 inability of a public body to post notice of a meeting pursuant to this subsection as a
12 result of technical problems with its website shall not be deemed to be a violation
13 of the provisions of this chapter.
14 7. Upon any request, a public body shall provide, at no charge, at least one
15 copy of:
16 (a) An agenda for a public meeting;
17 (b) A proposed ordinance or regulation which will be discussed at the public
18 meeting; and
19 (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection 8 or 9, as applicable, any other
20 supporting material provided to the members of the public body for an item on the
21 agenda, except materials:
22 (1) Submitted to the public body pursuant to a nondisclosure or
23 confidentiality agreement which relates to proprietary information;
24 (2) Pertaining to the closed portion of such a meeting of the public body; or
25 (3) Declared confidential by law, unless otherwise agreed to by each
26 person whose interest is being protected under the order of confidentiality.
27  The public body shall make at least one copy of the documents described in
28 paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) available to the public at the meeting to which the
29 documents pertain. As used in this subsection, “proprietary information” has the
30 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 332.025.
31 8. Unless it must be made available at an earlier time pursuant to NRS
32 288.153, a copy of supporting material required to be provided upon request
33 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 7 must be:
34 (a) If the supporting material is provided to the members of the public body
35 before the meeting, made available to the requester at the time the material is
36 provided to the members of the public body; or
37 (b) If the supporting material is provided to the members of the public body at
38 the meeting, made available at the meeting to the requester at the same time the
39 material is provided to the members of the public body.
40  If the requester has agreed to receive the information and material set forth in
41 subsection 7 by electronic mail, the public body shall, if feasible, provide the
42 information and material by electronic mail.

44 NRS 288.153, and except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, the governing
45 body of a county or city whose population is 52,000 or more shall post the
46 supporting material described in paragraph (c) of subsection 7 to its website not
47 later than the time the material is provided to the members of the governing body
48 or, if the supporting material is provided to the members of the governing body at a
49 meeting, not later than 24 hours after the conclusion of the meeting. Such posting is
50 supplemental to the right of the public to request the supporting material pursuant
51 to subsection 7. The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical
52 problems with its website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection
53 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

Assembly Amendment No. 127 to Assembly Bill No. 247 Page 7
1 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, a public body may provide
2 the public notice, information or supporting material required by this section by
3 electronic mail. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a public body
4 makes such notice, information or supporting material available by electronic mail,
5 the public body shall inquire of a person who requests the notice, information or
6 supporting material if the person will accept receipt by electronic mail. If a public
7 body is required to post the public notice, information or supporting material on its
8 website pursuant to this section, the public body shall inquire of a person who
9 requests the notice, information or supporting material if the person will accept by
10 electronic mail a link to the posting on the website when the documents are made
11 available. The inability of a public body, as a result of technical problems with its
12 electronic mail system, to provide a public notice, information or supporting
13 material or a link to a website required by this section to a person who has agreed to
14 receive such notice, information, supporting material or link by electronic mail
15 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
16 11. If a public body holds a meeting using a remote technology system
17 pursuant to NRS 241.023 and has no physical location for the meeting, the public
18 body must:
19 (a) Have an Internet website; and
20 (b) Post to its Internet website:
21 (1) The public notice required by this section; and
22 (2) Supporting material not later than the time the material is provided to
23 the members of the governing body or, if the supporting material is provided to the
24 members of the governing body at a meeting, not later than 24 hours after the
25 conclusion of the meeting.
26  The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical problems with its
27 Internet website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection shall not be
28 deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
29 12. As used in this section [, “emergency”] :
30 (a) “Communication Access Realtime Translation” has the meaning
31 ascribed to it in NRS 656A.025.
32 (b) “Emergency” means an unforeseen circumstance which requires
33 immediate action and includes, but is not limited to:
34 [(a)] (1) Disasters caused by fire, flood, earthquake or other natural causes; or

39 set forth in this section, for the removal and elimination of architectural barriers to
40 persons with a physical handicap in public buildings and facilities designed after

42 physical handicap and to make public buildings accessible to and usable by persons
43 with a physical handicap; and
44 (b) It is the intent of the Legislature that insofar as possible all buildings and
45 facilities used by the public be accessible to, and functional for, persons with a
46 physical handicap, without loss of function, space or facility where the general
47 public is concerned.
48 2. All plans and specifications for the construction of public buildings and
49 facilities owned by a public body must, after July 1, 1973, provide facilities and
50 features for persons with a physical handicap so that buildings which are normally
51 used by the public are constructed with entrance ramps, toilet facilities, drinking
52 fountains, doors and public telephones accessible to and usable by persons with a
53 physical handicap. In addition, all plans and specifications for the construction or

Assembly Amendment No. 127 to Assembly Bill No. 247 Page 8
1 alteration of public buildings and facilities owned by a public body must comply
2 with the applicable requirements of the:
3 (a) Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and
4 the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, including, without limitation, the

13 and specifications comply solely with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards
14 set forth in Appendix A of Part 101-19.6 of Title 41 of the Code of Federal
15 Regulations.
16 3. All public bodies shall, in the design, construction and alteration of public
17 buildings and facilities comply with the applicable requirements of the:
18 (a) Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., and
