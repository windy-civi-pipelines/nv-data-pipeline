AN ACT relating to education; revising the criteria for pupils to be

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires financial institutions, mining businesses and other
2 employers to pay an excise tax (the modified business tax) on wages paid by them.
3 (NRS 363A.130, 363B.110) Existing law also requires certain insurers to pay a tax
4 of 3.5 percent upon net direct premiums and net direct considerations written by
5 those insurers (the insurance premium tax). (NRS 680B.027) Existing law
6 establishes a credit against the modified business tax for a taxpayer who makes a
7 donation to a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of pupils who
8 are members of a household with a household income of not more than 300 percent
9 of the federally designated level signifying poverty to allow those pupils to attend
10 schools in this State, including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal
11 guardians of those pupils (the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program).
12 (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119, 388D.270) Existing law authorizes the Department of
13 Taxation to approve applications for such tax credits until the total amount of
14 credits authorized for each fiscal year is $6,655,000. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119)

15 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill increase the amount of tax credits that the
16 Department of Taxation is authorized to approve for donations made to a
17 scholarship organization through the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship
18 Program from $6,655,000 for each fiscal year to: (1) for Fiscal Year 2025-2026,
19 $30,000,000; and (2) for each succeeding fiscal year, 110 percent of the amount
20 authorized for the immediately preceding fiscal year. Sections 7 and 8 of this bill
21 establish a credit against the insurance premium tax for an insurer who makes a
22 donation to a scholarship organization through the Nevada Educational Choice
23 Scholarship Program to be administered in the same manner as the credit against
24 the modified business tax. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to
25 indicate that this credit is part of the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship
26 Program. Section 9 of this bill makes a conforming change to make certain
27 provisions governing the insurance premium tax applicable to this credit. Sections
28 5, 10 and 11 of this bill make conforming changes to make this credit applicable to
29 certain entities who are subject to the insurance premium tax.
30 Section 2 of this bill expands the existing criteria of pupils on whose behalf
31 scholarship organizations must provide grants to include pupils: (1) on whose
32 behalf a grant was awarded for the immediately preceding school year; (2) who are
33 the sibling of a pupil on whose behalf a grant was awarded for the current or
34 immediately preceding school year; (3) who have an individualized education
35 program; (4) who have a parent or legal guardian who is on active duty in the
36 Armed Forces of the United States; and (5) who have a parent or legal guardian
37 who is a peace officer or firefighter. Section 2 also modifies the existing
38 requirement that scholarship organizations provide grants on behalf of pupils who
39 are members of a household that has a household income within a certain
40 percentage of the federally designated level signifying poverty by increasing that
41 percentage from 300 percent of the federally designated level to 400 percent.
42 Section 2 further establishes the order of priority in which a scholarship
43 organization is required to award grants and requires that each grant made by a
44 scholarship organization be not less than $1,000.

5 Sec. 9. NRS 680B.025 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 680B.025 For the purposes of NRS 680B.025 to 680B.039,
7 inclusive [:] , and sections 7 and 8 of this act:
8 1. “Total income derived from direct premiums written”:
9 (a) Does not include premiums written or considerations
10 received from life insurance policies or annuity contracts issued in
11 connection with the funding of a pension, annuity or profit-sharing
12 plan qualified or exempt pursuant to sections 401, 403, 404, 408,
13 457 or 501 of the United States Internal Revenue Code as
14 renumbered from time to time.
15 (b) Does not include payments received by an insurer from the
16 Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to a contract
17 entered into pursuant to section 1876 of the Social Security Act, 42
18 U.S.C. § 1395mm.
19 (c) As to title insurance, consists of the total amount charged by
20 the company for the sale of policies of title insurance.
21 2. Money accepted by a life insurer pursuant to an agreement
22 which provides for an accumulation of money to purchase annuities
23 at future dates may be considered as “total income derived from
24 direct premiums written” either upon receipt or upon the actual
25 application of the money to the purchase of annuities, but any
26 interest credited to money accumulated while under the latter
27 alternative must also be included in “total income derived from
28 direct premiums written,” and any money taxed upon receipt,
29 including any interest later credited thereto, is not subject to taxation
30 upon the purchase of annuities. Each life insurer shall signify on its
31 return covering premiums for the calendar year 1971 or for the first
32 calendar year it transacts business in this State, whichever is later,
33 its election between those two alternatives. Thereafter an insurer
34 shall not change his or her election without the consent of the
35 Commissioner. Any such money taxed as “total income derived
36 from direct premiums written” is, in the event of withdrawal of the
37 money before its actual application to the purchase of annuities,
38 eligible to be included as “return premiums” pursuant to the
39 provisions of NRS 680B.030.
40 Sec. 10. NRS 695B.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 695B.320 1. Nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
