EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to athletics; requiring certain schools and
institutions of higher education to designate by sex the
athletic teams and sports sponsored by the schools or
institutions; prohibiting male or female athletes from
competing on teams designated for the other sex;
prohibiting certain actions from being brought against a
school or institution for maintaining a separate athletic
team or sport designated for pupils and students of the
female or male sex; establishing certain causes of action;
establishing the statute of limitations for such actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs athletics in schools and in institutions of higher education.
2 (Chapters 385B and 398 of NRS) Section 5 of this bill requires a public school or a
3 private school that competes against a public school to designate, based on
4 biological sex at birth, each athletic team or sport that is sponsored by the school as
5 being for males, for females or for both males and females. Section 5 prohibits
6 such a school from opening an athletic team or sport that is designated for females
7 or males to participation by members of the other sex. Section 6 of this bill
8 provides that a school’s compliance with section 5 does not constitute
9 discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity or expression under any state
10 statute or local ordinance. Section 6 also prohibits certain entities that oversee
11 athletic teams and sports that are sponsored by public schools from taking certain

12 adverse actions against a school for maintaining a separate athletic team or sport for
13 females or males. Sections 10 and 11 of this bill establish similar provisions
14 applicable to public and private institutions of higher education. Sections 3, 4 and
15 9 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the
16 applicability of the definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4.
17 Section 7 of this bill authorizes a pupil to bring a civil action against: (1) a
18 school for a violation of sections 2-7; or (2) a school or athletic association or
19 organization for retaliating against the pupil for reporting a violation of sections 2-
20 7 to the school, athletic association or organization or a state or federal agency with
21 oversight of the school. Section 7 additionally authorizes a school to bring a civil
22 action against a governmental entity, licensing or accrediting organization or
23 athletic association or organization for a violation of sections 2-7. Section 7
24 establishes: (1) the period within which such a civil action must be filed; and (2) the
25 types of relief available in such a civil action. Section 12 of this bill establishes
26 similar provisions applicable to public and private institutions of higher education.
1 WHEREAS, In 2018, Communicative & Integrative Biology
2 published an article titled “Only two sex forms but multiple gender
3 variants: How to explain?” which stated that “with respect to
4 biological sex, one is either male or female”; and
5 WHEREAS, In 2021, BJPsych Bulletin published an article titled
6 “Sex, gender and gender identity: a re-evaluation of the evidence,”
7 which explained that the sex of a natural person “is determined at
8 fertili[z]ation and revealed at birth or, increasingly, in utero”; and
9 WHEREAS, In 2012, Chromosome Research published an article
10 titled “Mammalian sex determination-insights from humans and
11 mice,” which stated that “biological differences between males and
12 females are determined genetically during embryonic development”;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, In 2021, Sports Medicine published an article titled
15 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
16 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage,” which
17 asserted that the “[s]econdary sex characteristics that develop during
18 puberty . . . generate anatomical divergence beyond the reproductive
19 system, leading to adult body types that are measurably different
20 between sexes”; and
21 WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court has declared there
22 are inherent differences between men and women and these
23 differences are “cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the
24 members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s
25 opportunity” (United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996));
26 and
27 WHEREAS, In 2016, the European Journal of Sport Science
28 published an article titled “Physical fitness normative values for 6-
29 18-year-old Greek boys and girls, using the empirical distribution
30 and the lambda, mu, and sigma statistical method” and in 2011, the
31 British Journal of Sports Medicine published an article titled
-
*AB240*

– 3 –
1 “Normative health-related fitness values for children: Analysis of
2 85347 test results on 9-17-year-old Australians since 1985,” which
3 discussed studies of large cohorts of children who were between 6
4 and 19 years of age and found that boys typically scored higher than
5 girls on cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular
6 endurance and speed and agility but lower on flexibility; and
7 WHEREAS, In 2017, the International Journal of Sports
8 Physiology and Performance published an article titled “Sex
9 Differences in World Record Performance: The Influence of Sport
10 Discipline and Competition Duration,” which concluded that the
11 physiological differences between males and females that are
12 relevant to performance in sports “include a larger body size with
13 more skeletal muscle mass, a lower percentage of body fat, as well
14 as greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and aerobic energy”; and
15 WHEREAS, In 2017, Law and Contemporary Problems
16 published an article titled “Sex in Sport” that explained that men
17 having higher natural levels of testosterone is significant because it
18 affects traits such as “hemoglobin levels, body fat content, ‘the
19 absolute ability to store and use carbohydrate,’ and the development
20 of ‘Type 2 muscle fibers, which are used to generate speed and
21 power’ ”; and
22 WHEREAS, The article published in Sports Medicine titled
23 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
24 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage” also
25 explained that there is a gap between males and females with regard
26 to performance in sports such that the physiological advantages
27 conferred on males by biological sex “appear, on assessment of
28 performance data, [to be] insurmountable”; and
29 WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court has also declared
30 that while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored,
31 “[s]ex classifications may be used to compensate women for
32 particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promot[e]
33 equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development
34 of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people” (United States v.
35 Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (alteration in original) (internal
36 citations and quotations omitted); and
37 WHEREAS, One area where sex classifications allow for the full
38 development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people is in
39 the context of sports and athletics; and
40 WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of Rhode Island and the Illinois
41 Fourth District Appeals Court have recognized that the inherent,
42 physiological differences between males and females result in
43 different athletic capabilities (Kleczek v. R.I. Interscholastic League,
44 Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass’n,
45 394 N.E.2d 855, 861); and
-
*AB240*

– 4 –
1 WHEREAS, The article published in Sports Medicine titled
2 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
3 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage” also
4 explained that the benefits that natural testosterone provides to male
5 athletes are not significantly diminished through the use of
6 testosterone suppression; and
7 WHEREAS, That article found that policies like those of the
8 International Olympic Committee requiring biological males to
9 undergo at least 1 year of testosterone suppression before competing
10 in women’s sports do not create a level playing field; and
11 WHEREAS, That article concluded that the reduction in
12 testosterone levels required by policies like those of the
13 International Olympic Committee “is insufficient to remove or
14 reduce the male advantage, in terms of muscle mass and strength, by
15 any meaningful degree”; and
16 WHEREAS, That article concluded “that superior anthropometric,
17 muscle mass and strength parameters achieved by males at puberty,
18 and underpinning a considerable portion of the male performance
19 advantage over females, are not removed by the current regimen of
20 testosterone suppression” permitted by the International Olympic
21 Committee and other sports organizations; and
22 WHEREAS, That article instead found that “male performance
23 advantage remains substantial” and “raises obvious concerns about
24 fair and safe competition”; and
25 WHEREAS, Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to
26 promote equality between the sexes by providing opportunities for
27 female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength and athletic
28 abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain
29 recognition, accolades, college scholarships and the numerous other
30 long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors; and
31 WHEREAS, If males were permitted to compete in female sports,
32 the risk of injury to females would be increased by the ability of a
33 biological male to exert greater force, strength and power, and also
34 by females’ reduced ability to receive or tolerate that force; and
35 WHEREAS, Separating participants in contact sports based on
36 biological sex promotes the safety of female athletes by protecting
37 them from predictable and preventable injuries caused by male
38 athletes; now, therefore,
