SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to remove the constitutional provisions
governing the Legislature’s authority to apportion
Senators and members of the Assembly among counties
or legislative districts of the State and create the
Independent Redistricting Commission vested with
the power to apportion Senators and members of the
Assembly in the Legislature and members of the United
States House of Representatives among districts
established by the Commission.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Legislature to apportion
2 Senators and members of the Assembly among the counties or legislative districts
3 of the State after each decennial census. (Nev. Const. Art. 4, § 5) This resolution
4 proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to remove the constitutional provisions
5 that require the Legislature to apportion Senators and members of the Assembly
6 and, instead, create the Independent Redistricting Commission to apportion
7 Senators, members of the Assembly and representatives in the United States House
8 of Representatives among legislative districts established by the Commission.
9 This resolution proposes adding new sections to the Nevada Constitution to
10 create the Independent Redistricting Commission and requires the Commission to
11 apportion representatives of the United States House of Representatives among
12 congressional districts established by the Commission. This proposed amendment
13 to the Nevada Constitution requires the Commission to apportion Senators,
14 members of the Assembly and members of the United States House of
15 Representatives beginning in 2031 and after each subsequent decennial census of
16 the United States.

17 This proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution requires: (1) the
18 Commission to be composed of seven members who are registered and eligible to
19 vote in this State; and (2) the Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader,
20 Speaker of the Assembly and Assembly Minority Leader to each appoint one
21 member. The remaining three members are: (1) required to be appointed by the four
22 members appointed by the legislative officers; and (2) prohibited from being
23 registered or affiliated with the largest or second largest political party for at least 4
24 years immediately preceding their appointment. This proposed amendment to the
25 Nevada Constitution requires the members of the Commission to serve terms for
26 the duration of the obligations of a census cycle.
27 This proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution also specifies the criteria
28 that the Commission is required to use in adopting a redistricting plan.
29 This proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution provides for certain
30 provisions of these constitutional amendments to remain in effect in the event that
31 any other provision is deemed unconstitutional.
32 If this joint resolution is passed by the 2025 Legislature, it must also be passed
33 by the next Legislature and then approved and ratified by the voters in an election
34 before the proposed amendments to the Nevada Constitution become effective.

1 Sec. 5B. 1. The Independent Redistricting
2 Commission shall draw districts for a redistricting plan
3 using the following criteria, in the order listed:
4 (a) Districts comply with the United States Constitution
5 and applicable federal law.
6 (b) Districts have an approximately equal number of
7 inhabitants.
8 (c) Districts are geographically contiguous.

12 elect representatives of their choice, whether by themselves
13 or voting in concert with other persons.
14 (e) Districts do not unduly advantage or disadvantage a
15 political party, when considered on a statewide basis.
16 (f) Districts reflect county, city and township
17 boundaries, to the extent practicable.
18 (g) Districts do not divide communities of interest, to the
19 extent practicable. Communities of interest are areas with

24 (h) Districts are reasonably compact.
25 (i) Districts are politically competitive, to the extent
26 practicable without impairing compliance with paragraphs
27 (a) to (h), inclusive. A district is politically competitive if

29 district’s representative to change at least once between
30 each federal decennial census.

38 Commission may only approve a final plan with at least five
39 affirmative votes, including at least one from a
40 commissioner registered with the largest political party, one
41 from a commissioner registered with the second largest
42 political party and one from a commissioner not registered
43 or affiliated with the largest or second largest political party,
44 according to voter registration data published by the
45 Secretary of State as of January 1 of the redistricting year.

1 And be it further
2 RESOLVED, That a new section, designated Section 5C, be added
3 to Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution to read as follows:
4 Sec. 5C. If any part of Section 5A or 5B of this Article,
5 as applicable, is declared invalid, or the application thereof
6 to any person, thing or circumstance is held invalid, such
7 invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions or
8 application of Section 5A or 5B of this Article, as
