AN ACT relating to public monuments; prohibiting, with certain
exceptions, a governmental agency from removing or

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, upon the recommendation of the Administrator of the

3 Resources and the Director of the Department, the Governor is authorized to, by
4 proclamation, designate any site, place or building located on any publicly owned
5 land, or any land in the State held by the Division under lease or permit, as a state
6 park, state monument or recreational area. (NRS 407.120) Section 1 of this bill: (1)
7 prohibits a governmental agency from removing or destroying a monument that is
8 located on state lands or any other publicly owned land unless the removal or
9 destruction of the monument is approved by the Governor; and (2) excepts from
10 that prohibition the relocation of such a monument by a governmental agency to a
11 site of similar prominence, honor, visibility and access.
12 Existing law provides that a person who unlawfully places graffiti on or
13 otherwise defaces the public or private property of another without the permission
14 of the owner is guilty of a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor or felony, depending
15 on the value of the loss of the property and the nature of the property. Specifically,
16 existing law provides that a person who commits such acts on any protected site,

23 penalty, order such a person to pay restitution. Section 3 also makes a conforming
