14 on the public work, the contractor or subcontractor shall submit an
15 additional request each time that the contractor or subcontractor
16 resumes work on the public work not earlier than 10 days before the
17 contractor or subcontractor is scheduled to resume work on the
18 public work and not later than 5 days after the contractor or

41 final decision for the purposes of judicial review pursuant to chapter
42 233B of NRS.
