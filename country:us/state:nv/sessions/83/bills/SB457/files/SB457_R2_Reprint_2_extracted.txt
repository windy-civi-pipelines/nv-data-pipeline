Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
-
*SB457_R2*
– 2 –
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill revise the definition
13 of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to
14 include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose
15 normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and
16 (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or
17 other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1.3
18 and 1.7 of this act apply the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed
19 against a hospitality employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 2 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 2 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 50 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 2.
30 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
31 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
32 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of the sexual portrayal or engaging
33 in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty
34 of possession of pornography involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this
35 bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each
36 person depicted under the age of 16 years in any film, photograph or other visual
37 presentation constitutes a separate offense. Section 41 of this bill makes a
38 conforming change related to section 3.
39 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is
40 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a
41 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a
42 firearm by certain persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having
43 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361)
44 Sections 4, 30 and 51 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a compliance
45 hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied with
46 a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 4, 30 and 51,
47 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain
48 circumstances. Sections 5, 31 and 52 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
49 existing law to sections 4, 30 and 51, respectively.
50 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
51 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 29.1 of this bill creates a new crime
52 which provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
53 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
54 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
55 $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
56 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
57 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 32 of this bill
58 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
-
*SB457_R2*

59 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
60 domestic violence.
61 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
62 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 34.3 of this bill provides that the entry of a
63 certificate of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a
64 finding that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not
65 probable cause under certain circumstances.
66 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
67 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
68 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 35 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
69 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
70 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
71 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has in the previous year been
72 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 36 of this
73 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
74 section 35.
75 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the license of a juvenile under
76 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because
77 the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed an unlawful acts related to tobacco;
78 (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a controlled substance or alcohol; or
79 (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630,
80 62E.690) Sections 39.2-39.8 of this bill make various changes to authorize the
81 juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a restricted
82 driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest of the child.
83 Section 76.5 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
84 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s
85 license.
86 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
87 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
88 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
89 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
90 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
91 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
92 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
93 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 42, 44, 46 and 49
94 of this bill provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such
95 persons who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a
96 child or the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
97 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
98 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
99 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
100 Section 56 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
101 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
102 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
103 by the defendant. Section 55 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
104 procedures prescribed by section 56.
105 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a
106 district attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which
107 the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial
108 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on
109 a weekend or holiday to serve as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing.
110 (NRS 178.760) Section 58 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
111 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
112 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that
113 encompasses the city attorney for the limited purpose of serving as a prosecuting

115 stipend for such services.
116 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial
117 programs for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS
118 209.4871-209.4889) Section 60.8 authorizes the Department of Corrections to
119 establish an alternative correctional program for the reentry of certain offenders
120 into the community. Sections 60.7, 61.3 and 61.7 of this bill establish and revise
121 various provisions concerning the alternative correctional programs.
122 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the
123 sheriff, chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of
124 prisoners with a substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS
125 209.4247, 211.400) Sections 61 and 62 of this bill require persons who establish
126 such programs to collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services if
127 the program relates to opioid use disorder.
128 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
129 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
130 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the
131 powers are expressly granted to the board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern”
132 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of
133 county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
134 regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
135 State. (NRS 244.357) Section 65.5 of this bill requires a board of county
136 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
137 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
138 one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
139 public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
140 of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 65.5
141 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
142 adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense
143 within the corridor within two years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
144 suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
145 entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed 1
146 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
147 must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred
148 adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the
149 offense occurred for a period of not less than 1 year.
150 Section 29.5 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the
151 board of county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic
152 boundaries of one or more corridors pursuant to section 65.5, to establish an
153 appropriate program for the adjudication of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor
154 that occurred within the boundaries of such corridors.
155 Section 29.7 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a
156 corridor established pursuant to section 65.5 to prepare and submit: (1) to the
157 Legislature an annual report containing certain information regarding crimes that
158 occur within such corridors; and (2) to the respective board of county
159 commissioners a monthly report containing certain information regarding crimes
160 that occur within such corridors.
161 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct
162 a statewide needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from
163 the Fund for a Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, develop a
164 statewide plan for allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.734) Existing law
165 also prescribes specific requirements concerning the statewide needs assessment.

171 provisions renumbered by section 70.
172 Existing law establishes provisions related to peer recovery support services.
173 (NRS 433.622-433.641) Section 66 of this bill requires the Department of Health
174 and Human Services to make available certain information relating to peer recovery
175 support services. Sections 68 and 85-87 of this bill make conforming changes
176 governing the applicability of section 66 to certain existing provisions of law
177 related to peer support services.
178 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a
179 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a
180 prohibited substance under certain circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS
181 488.400-488.520) Sections 77 and 81 of this bill provide that the prohibition on a
182 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
183 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
184 a felony. Sections 80 and 82 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a
185 person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
186 operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
187 substance. Additionally, sections 80 and 82 further provide that any such person
188 who proximately causes the death of another person and who has previously been
189 once or twice convicted of certain offenses related to driving or operating a vehicle
190 or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is subject to an
191 increased penalty.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
-
*SB457_R2*

– 2 –
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill revise the definition
13 of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to
14 include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose
15 normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and
16 (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or
17 other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1.3
18 and 1.7 of this act apply the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed
19 against a hospitality employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 2 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 2 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 50 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 2.
30 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
31 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
32 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of the sexual portrayal or engaging
33 in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty
34 of possession of pornography involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this
35 bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each
36 person depicted under the age of 16 years in any film, photograph or other visual
37 presentation constitutes a separate offense. Section 41 of this bill makes a
38 conforming change related to section 3.
39 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is
40 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a
41 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a
42 firearm by certain persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having
43 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361)
44 Sections 4, 30 and 51 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a compliance
45 hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied with
46 a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 4, 30 and 51,
47 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain
48 circumstances. Sections 5, 31 and 52 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
49 existing law to sections 4, 30 and 51, respectively.
50 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
51 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 29.1 of this bill creates a new crime
52 which provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
53 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
54 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
55 $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
56 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
57 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 32 of this bill
58 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
-
*SB457_R2*

– 3 –
59 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
60 domestic violence.
61 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
62 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 34.3 of this bill provides that the entry of a
63 certificate of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a
64 finding that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not
65 probable cause under certain circumstances.
66 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
67 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
68 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 35 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
69 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
70 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
71 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has in the previous year been
72 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 36 of this
73 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
74 section 35.
75 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the license of a juvenile under
76 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because
77 the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed an unlawful acts related to tobacco;
78 (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a controlled substance or alcohol; or
79 (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630,
80 62E.690) Sections 39.2-39.8 of this bill make various changes to authorize the
81 juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a restricted
82 driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest of the child.
83 Section 76.5 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
84 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s
85 license.
86 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
87 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
88 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
89 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
90 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
91 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
92 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
93 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 42, 44, 46 and 49
94 of this bill provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such
95 persons who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a
96 child or the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
97 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
98 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
99 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
100 Section 56 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
101 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
102 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
103 by the defendant. Section 55 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
104 procedures prescribed by section 56.
105 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a
106 district attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which
107 the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial
108 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on
109 a weekend or holiday to serve as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing.
110 (NRS 178.760) Section 58 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
111 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
112 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that
113 encompasses the city attorney for the limited purpose of serving as a prosecuting
-
*SB457_R2*

– 4 –
114 attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the city attorney to receive the
115 stipend for such services.
116 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial
117 programs for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS
118 209.4871-209.4889) Section 60.8 authorizes the Department of Corrections to
119 establish an alternative correctional program for the reentry of certain offenders
120 into the community. Sections 60.7, 61.3 and 61.7 of this bill establish and revise
121 various provisions concerning the alternative correctional programs.
122 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the
123 sheriff, chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of
124 prisoners with a substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS
125 209.4247, 211.400) Sections 61 and 62 of this bill require persons who establish
126 such programs to collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services if
127 the program relates to opioid use disorder.
128 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
129 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
130 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the
131 powers are expressly granted to the board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern”
132 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of
133 county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
134 regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
135 State. (NRS 244.357) Section 65.5 of this bill requires a board of county
136 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
137 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
138 one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
139 public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
140 of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 65.5
141 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
142 adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense
143 within the corridor within two years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
144 suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
145 entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed 1
146 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
147 must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred
148 adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the
149 offense occurred for a period of not less than 1 year.
150 Section 29.5 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the
151 board of county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic
152 boundaries of one or more corridors pursuant to section 65.5, to establish an
153 appropriate program for the adjudication of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor
154 that occurred within the boundaries of such corridors.
155 Section 29.7 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a
156 corridor established pursuant to section 65.5 to prepare and submit: (1) to the
157 Legislature an annual report containing certain information regarding crimes that
158 occur within such corridors; and (2) to the respective board of county
159 commissioners a monthly report containing certain information regarding crimes
160 that occur within such corridors.
161 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct
162 a statewide needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from
163 the Fund for a Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, develop a
164 statewide plan for allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.734) Existing law
165 also prescribes specific requirements concerning the statewide needs assessment.
166 (NRS 433.736) Section 70 of this bill requires the statewide assessment to establish
167 priorities related to the identification of educational resources to be used for
168 the training of law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies related to
-

– 5 –
169 trauma-informed practices and medication-assisted treatment for persons with
170 opioid use disorder. Section 69 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to
171 provisions renumbered by section 70.
172 Existing law establishes provisions related to peer recovery support services.
173 (NRS 433.622-433.641) Section 66 of this bill requires the Department of Health
174 and Human Services to make available certain information relating to peer recovery
175 support services. Sections 68 and 85-87 of this bill make conforming changes
176 governing the applicability of section 66 to certain existing provisions of law
177 related to peer support services.
178 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a
179 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a
180 prohibited substance under certain circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS
181 488.400-488.520) Sections 77 and 81 of this bill provide that the prohibition on a
182 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
183 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
184 a felony. Sections 80 and 82 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a
185 person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
186 operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
187 substance. Additionally, sections 80 and 82 further provide that any such person
188 who proximately causes the death of another person and who has previously been
189 once or twice convicted of certain offenses related to driving or operating a vehicle
190 or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is subject to an
191 increased penalty.
192 Sections 87.3 and 87.5 make appropriations to the Interim Finance Committee
193 for allocation to the Department of Corrections and the Administrative Office of the
194 Courts for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this act.
