Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill revise the definition
13 of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to
14 include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose
15 normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and
16 (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or
17 other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1.3
18 and 1.7 of this act apply the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed
19 against a hospitality employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 2 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 2 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 50 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 2.
30 Existing law makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions, to intercept, listen or
31 record a wire, electronic or oral communication. In relevant part, existing law
32 establishes various exceptions to this prohibition for peace officers acting under
33 certain circumstances related to the barricade of a person, a hostage situation or the
34 threatened used of an explosive. (NRS 179.463, 200.620) Sections 2.5 and 60.3 of
35 this bill establish an additional exception for a peace officer or certain persons
36 acting under the direction of the peace officer who intercept the communication for
37 the sole purpose of investigating a sexual offense against a child. Sections 60.2,
38 60.4 and 60.5 of this bill make various changes related to the terminology
39 applicable to section 60.5.
40 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
41 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
42 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of the sexual portrayal or engaging
43 in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty
44 of possession of pornography involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this
45 bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each
46 person depicted under the age of 16 years in any film, photograph or other visual
47 presentation constitutes a separate offense. Section 41 of this bill makes a
48 conforming change related to section 3.
49 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is
50 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a
51 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a
52 firearm by certain persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having
53 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361)
54 Sections 4, 30 and 51 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a compliance
-
*SB457_R1*
– 3 –
55 hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied with
56 a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 4, 30 and 51,
57 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain
58 circumstances. Sections 5, 31 and 52 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
59 existing law to sections 4, 30 and 51, respectively.
60 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
61 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 29.1 of this bill creates a new crime
62 which provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
63 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
64 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
65 $500 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
66 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
67 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 32 of this bill
68 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
69 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
70 domestic violence.
71 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
72 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 34.3 of this bill provides that the entry of a
73 certificate of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a
74 finding that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not
75 probable cause under certain circumstances.
76 In general, existing law authorizes a juvenile court to order a child who is
77 subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or the parent or guardian of such a
78 child, or both, to perform community service. (NRS 62E.180) Existing law defines
79 “community service” for the purposes of such orders. (NRS 62A.060) Section 34.7
80 of this bill makes various changes to the definition of “community service.”
81 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
82 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
83 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 35 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
84 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
85 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
86 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has in the previous year been
87 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 36 of this
88 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
89 section 35.
90 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the license of a juvenile under
91 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because
92 the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed an unlawful acts related to tobacco;

95 62E.690) Sections 39.2-39.8 of this bill make various changes to authorize the
96 juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a restricted
97 driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest of the child.
98 Section 76.5 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
99 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s
100 license.
101 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
102 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
103 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
104 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
105 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
106 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
107 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
108 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 42, 44, 46 and 49

112 Existing law generally requires a court to hold a pretrial release hearing to
113 determine the custody status of a person not later than 48 hours after the person has
114 been taken into custody. (NRS 178.4849) Section 53 of this bill provides that the
115 48 hours within which a pretrial release hearing must be held excludes legal
116 holidays.
117 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
118 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
119 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
120 Section 56 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
121 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
122 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
123 by the defendant. Section 55 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
124 procedures prescribed by section 56.
125 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a

128 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on
129 a weekend or holiday to serve as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing.
130 (NRS 178.760) Section 58 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
131 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
132 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that

134 attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the city attorney to receive the

140 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial
141 programs for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS
142 209.4871-209.4889) Section 60.8 authorizes the Department of Corrections to
143 establish an alternative correctional program for the reentry of certain offenders
144 into the community. Sections 60.7, 61.3 and 61.7 of this bill establish and revise

151 the program relates to opioid use disorder.
152 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain

174 Section 29.5 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the

190 priorities related to the identification of educational resources to be used for the

200 related to peer support services.
201 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a

203 prohibited substance under certain circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS

205 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
206 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
207 a felony. Sections 80 and 82 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a

209 operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
210 substance. Additionally, sections 80 and 82 further provide that any such person
211 who proximately causes the death of another person and who has previously been
212 once or twice convicted of certain offenses related to driving or operating a vehicle
213 or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is subject to an
214 increased penalty.

2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an

10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill revise the definition
13 of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to
14 include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose
15 normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and
16 (2) perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or
17 other tasks that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1.3
18 and 1.7 of this act apply the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed
19 against a hospitality employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)

23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 2 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 50 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 2.
30 Existing law makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions, to intercept, listen or
31 record a wire, electronic or oral communication. In relevant part, existing law

43 in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty
44 of possession of pornography involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this
45 bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each
46 person depicted under the age of 16 years in any film, photograph or other visual
47 presentation constitutes a separate offense. Section 41 of this bill makes a

51 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a

53 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361)

58 circumstances. Sections 5, 31 and 52 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
59 existing law to sections 4, 30 and 51, respectively.

65 $500 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
66 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
67 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 32 of this bill
68 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as

77 subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or the parent or guardian of such a
78 child, or both, to perform community service. (NRS 62E.180) Existing law defines

105 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
106 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,

112 Existing law generally requires a court to hold a pretrial release hearing to
113 determine the custody status of a person not later than 48 hours after the person has

115 48 hours within which a pretrial release hearing must be held excludes legal
116 holidays.
117 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
118 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
119 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
120 Section 56 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
121 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the

205 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
206 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
207 a felony. Sections 80 and 82 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a

13 substance;
14 (e) Inhales, ingests, applies or otherwise uses any chemical,
15 poison or organic solvent, or any compound or combination of any
16 of these, to a degree which renders the person incapable of safely
17 operating or being in actual physical control of a power-driven
18 vessel or sailing vessel under way; or
19 (f) Has a prohibited substance in his or her blood or urine, as
20 applicable, in an amount that is equal to or greater than the amount

24 vessel or sailing vessel under way, if the act or neglect of duty
25 proximately causes the death of, or substantial bodily harm to,
26 another person, shall be punished as provided in subsection 2.
27 2. Unless a greater penalty is provided pursuant to NRS
28 488.425, a person who violates subsection 1 is guilty of :
29 (a) If the violation proximately causes the death of another
30 person and the person who committed the violation:

34 than 2 years and a maximum term of not more than 25 years and
35 shall be further punished by a fine of not less than $2,000 nor

1 than 2 years and a maximum term of not more than 20 years and

12 obvious that the charge is not supported by probable cause or cannot
13 be proved at the time of trial. A sentence imposed pursuant to
14 subsection [1] 2 must not be suspended, and probation must not be
15 granted.
16 [3.] 5. If consumption is proven by a preponderance of the

19 alcohol after operating or being in actual physical control of the
20 power-driven vessel or sailing vessel, as applicable, under way and
21 before his or her blood was tested, to cause the defendant to have a
22 concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her blood or
23 breath. A defendant who intends to offer this defense at a trial
24 or preliminary hearing must, not less than 14 days before the trial or
25 hearing or at such other time as the court may direct, file and serve
26 on the prosecuting attorney a written notice of that intent.
27 [4.] 6. If a person less than 15 years of age was in the vessel at
28 the time of the defendant’s violation, the court shall consider that
29 fact as an aggravating factor in determining the sentence of the
30 defendant.

32 (a) A violation of this section;
33 (b) A violation of NRS 488.410;
34 (c) A homicide resulting from operating or being in actual
35 physical custody of a power-driven vessel or sailing vessel under
