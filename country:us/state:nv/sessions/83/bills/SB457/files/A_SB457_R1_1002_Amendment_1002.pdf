Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
2 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
3 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
4 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the
5 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
6 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
7 commits a battery upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim
8 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
9 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and

Assembly Amendment No. 1002 to Senate Bill No. 457 First Reprint Page 4
10 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1.3 and
11 1.7 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for
12 assault or battery to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
13 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
14 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or other tasks that
15 expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this act apply
16 the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.
17 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties related to
18 the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575) Section 2 of this bill
19 expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include certain courses of conduct that
20 would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the
21 immediate safety of a person in a dating relationship with the victim. Section 2 also makes
22 various changes to provide that stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by
23 electronic means, and provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts
24 regardless of medium. Sections 50 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
25 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 2.
26 [Existing law makes it unlawful, with certain exceptions, to intercept, listen or record a
27 wire, electronic or oral communication. In relevant part, existing law establishes various
28 exceptions to this prohibition for peace officers acting under certain circumstances related to

37 age of 16 years as the subject of the sexual portrayal or engaging in, simulating, or assisting
38 others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of possession of pornography
39 involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this bill revises the unit of prosecution for
40 such an offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16 years in any film,
41 photograph or other visual presentation constitutes a separate offense. Section 41 of this bill
42 makes a conforming change related to section 3.
43 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is prohibited from
44 owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a firearm; and (2) establishes
45 procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a firearm by certain persons who are
46 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS
47 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361) Sections 4, 30 and 51 of this bill generally require a court
48 to schedule a compliance hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has
49 complied with a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 4, 30 and 51,
50 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain circumstances.

58 felony.
59 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence when
60 committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 32 of this bill revises the unlawful
61 acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as well as an attempt or
62 solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes domestic violence.
63 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction. (NRS
64 41.900-41.970) Section 34.3 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate of innocence
65 and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding that: (1) certain persons

68 jurisdiction of the juvenile court or the parent or guardian of such a child, or both, to perform

Assembly Amendment No. 1002 to Senate Bill No. 457 First Reprint Page 5
69 community service. (NRS 62E.180) Existing law defines “community service” for the
70 purposes of such orders. (NRS 62A.060) Section 34.7 of this bill makes various changes to the
71 definition of “community service.”]
72 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken into custody
73 and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the juvenile court. (NRS
74 62C.040) Section 35 of this bill requires the juvenile court to order a qualified professional to
75 evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is alleged to have committed certain unlawful
76 acts involving a battery against a school employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has

85 various changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles to
86 issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest of the child.

91 program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use disorder, a program for treatment of
92 mental illness or a program of treatment for veterans and members of the military or certain
93 other terms and conditions. Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to
94 the discharge, dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
95 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 42, 44, 46 and 49 of this bill
96 provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons who were
97 charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or the abuse of an older
98 or vulnerable person.
99 [Existing law generally requires a court to hold a pretrial release hearing to determine the
100 custody status of a person not later than 48 hours after the person has been taken into custody.

102 release hearing must be held excludes legal holidays.]
103 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the court has
104 not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which case, the bail must be
105 applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528) Section 56 of this bill provides
106 that under these circumstances if the bail has been deposited by a person other than a surety,
107 and upon notice and the agreement of the person, the bail must first be applied towards the
108 payment of any restitution owed by the defendant. Section 55 of this bill makes a conforming

116 (currently all counties except Clark and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a
117 person in the county that encompasses the city attorney for the limited purpose of serving as a
