37 is convicted of two or more offenses, and sentence has been pronounced for one
38 offense, the court in imposing any subsequent sentence may provide that the
39 sentences subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively with
40 the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if
41 the court makes no order with reference thereto, all such subsequent sentences run
42 concurrently. For offenses committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes
43 the sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the minimum and
44 maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant to subsection 2, unless the
45 defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or

48 (a) If at least one sentence imposes a maximum term of imprisonment for life
49 with the possibility of parole, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of
50 imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term of imprisonment, and the

1 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum term of
2 imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum terms of imprisonment to

4 maximum terms of imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
5 imprisonment.
6 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section [,] and subject to the
7 provisions of section 1 of this act, whenever a person under sentence of
8 imprisonment for committing a felony commits another crime constituting a felony
9 and is sentenced to another term of imprisonment for that felony, the latter term
10 must not begin until the expiration of all prior terms, including the expiration of any
11 prior aggregated terms. If the person is a probationer at the time the subsequent
12 felony is committed, the court may provide that the latter term of imprisonment run
13 concurrently with any prior terms or portions thereof.
14 4. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment commits another crime
15 constituting a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly
16 whether the sentence subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively
17 with the one first imposed.
18 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment commits another crime
19 for which the punishment is death or imprisonment for life without the possibility
20 of parole, the sentence must be executed without reference to the unexpired term of
21 imprisonment.
22 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of imprisonment, if the

27 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, the sentence imposed for the
28 additional penalty must be aggregated with the sentence imposed for the underlying
29 offense. A prisoner upon whom a sentence for an additional penalty is imposed
30 pursuant to NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act before
31 October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for the additional penalty
32 aggregated with the sentence imposed for the underlying offense in accordance
33 with subsection 5 of NRS 213.1212.
34 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole Commissioners
35 from paroling a person under consecutive sentences of imprisonment from a current
36 term of imprisonment to a subsequent term of imprisonment.
37 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the aggregation of any
38 sentences of imprisonment relating to different cases.] (Deleted by amendment.)

30 or 484C.120, upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the district court, justice
31 court or municipal court, as applicable, may conditionally dismiss the charges or set
32 aside the judgment of conviction, as applicable. If a court conditionally dismisses
33 the charges or sets aside the judgment of conviction, the court shall notify the
34 defendant that any conditionally dismissed charge or judgment of conviction that is
35 set aside is a conviction for the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second
36 or subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is not a
37 conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or
38 license or questionnaire or for any other public or private purpose. Conditional
39 dismissal or having a judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
40 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest, complaint,
41 indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter under any law
42 to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to
43 recite or acknowledge that arrest, complaint, indictment, information or trial in
44 response to an inquiry made of the defendant for any purpose.] (Deleted by

40 that the person will appear at all times and places ordered by the court, with regard
41 to the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and 178.498.
42 3. If a court imposes bail or any condition of release, or both, other than
43 release on recognizance with no other conditions of release, the court shall make
44 findings of fact for such a determination and state its reasoning on the record, and,
45 if the determination includes the imposition of a condition of release, the findings
46 of fact must include why the condition of release constitutes the least restrictive

50 unless the proof is evident or the presumption great by any competent court or

52 weight to the evidence and to the nature and circumstances of the offense.

8 (a) The person will appear at all times and places as ordered by the court
9 releasing the person and as ordered by any court before which the charge is
10 subsequently heard;
11 (b) The person will comply with the other conditions which have been imposed
12 by the court and are stated in the document;
13 (c) If the person fails to appear when so ordered and is taken into custody
14 outside of this State, the person waives all rights relating to extradition proceedings;
15 and
16 (d) The person understands that any court of competent jurisdiction may
17 revoke the order of release without bail and may order the person into custody or
18 require the person to furnish bail or otherwise ensure the protection of the safety of
19 the community or the person’s appearance, if applicable.
20 [6.] 7. The document signed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 must be filed with
21 the clerk of the court of competent jurisdiction and becomes effective upon the

25 notice and an opportunity for a hearing:
26 (a) Deem such conduct a contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010;
27 (b) Impose such additional conditions of release as the court deems necessary
28 to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the person will appear at the
29 times and places ordered by the court;
30 (c) Increase the amount of bail pursuant to NRS 178.499, if applicable; or
31 (d) Revoke bail and remand the person into custody.

33 incurs any costs in returning a person to the jurisdiction to stand trial, the person
34 failing to appear is responsible for paying those costs as restitution.
35 [9.] 10. An order issued pursuant to this section that imposes a condition on a
36 person must include a provision ordering a law enforcement officer to arrest the
37 person if the law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the person
38 has violated a condition of release.

40 receive the request of a prosecuting attorney before imposing a condition of release.

1 the person incapable of safely driving or exercising actual physical control of a
2 vehicle,
3  to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle on a highway or on premises
4 to which the public has access. The fact that any person charged with a violation of

6 not a defense against any charge of violating this subsection.
7 3. It is unlawful for any person to drive or be in actual physical control of a
8 vehicle on a highway or on premises to which the public has access with an amount

39
40 5. If consumption is proven by a preponderance of the evidence, it is an
41 affirmative defense under paragraph (c) of subsection 1 that the defendant

43 control of the vehicle, and before his or her blood or breath was tested, to cause the
44 defendant to have a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more in his or her blood or
45 breath. A defendant who intends to offer this defense at a trial or preliminary

47 as the court may direct, file and serve on the prosecuting attorney a written notice
48 of that intent.
