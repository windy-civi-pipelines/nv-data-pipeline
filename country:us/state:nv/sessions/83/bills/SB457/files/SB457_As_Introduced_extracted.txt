3 commission of the crime. (NRS 193.161-193.1685) Section 1 of this bill provides
4 that a person who is released on bail or conditions of release after being arrested for
5 a felony and while so released commits another felony, is subject to an additional
6 penalty. Section 40 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
7 establishment of the additional penalty and the aggregation of sentences.
8 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
9 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
10 Section 2 of this bill makes various changes to provide that stalking encompasses
11 both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and provides that such
12 penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of medium. Sections 50
13 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to section 2.
14 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
15 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
16 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of the sexual portrayal or engaging
17 in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty
18 of possession of pornography involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this

20 possession of each film, photograph or other visual representation constitutes a
21 separate offense. Section 41 of this bill makes a conforming change related to

31 sentence has been pronounced for one offense, the court in imposing
32 any subsequent sentence may provide that the sentences
33 subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively
34 with the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in
35 subsections 3 and 4, if the court makes no order with reference
36 thereto, all such subsequent sentences run concurrently. For offenses
37 committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes the
38 sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the
39 minimum and maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant
40 to subsection 2, unless the defendant is sentenced to life

3 aggregate term of imprisonment shall be deemed to be
4 imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of
5 parole.
6 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum
7 term of imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum
8 terms of imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term
9 of imprisonment and must aggregate the maximum terms of
10 imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
11 imprisonment.
12 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section [,] and subject
13 to the provisions of section 1 of this act, whenever a person under
14 sentence of imprisonment for committing a felony commits another
15 crime constituting a felony and is sentenced to another term of
16 imprisonment for that felony, the latter term must not begin until the
17 expiration of all prior terms, including the expiration of any prior
18 aggregated terms. If the person is a probationer at the time the

23 commits another crime constituting a misdemeanor or gross
24 misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly whether the sentence
25 subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively with
26 the one first imposed.
27 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment
28 commits another crime for which the punishment is death or
29 imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, the sentence
30 must be executed without reference to the unexpired term of
31 imprisonment.
32 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of

42 NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act
43 before October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for
44 the additional penalty aggregated with the sentence imposed for the
-
*SB457*
– 34 –
1 underlying offense in accordance with subsection 5 of
2 NRS 213.1212.
3 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole
4 Commissioners from paroling a person under consecutive sentences
5 of imprisonment from a current term of imprisonment to a
6 subsequent term of imprisonment.
7 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the
8 aggregation of any sentences of imprisonment relating to different

33 to the provisions of subsection 3 remains subject to the provisions
34 for registration as a sex offender and to the provisions for

14 penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions or the
15 setting of bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the defendant, in the
16 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
17 indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter

28 court shall notify the defendant that any conditionally dismissed
29 charge or judgment of conviction that is set aside is a conviction for
30 the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second or
31 subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is
32 not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any
33 statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other
34 public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
35 judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
36 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
37 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
38 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
39 giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or

5 public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
6 judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
7 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
8 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
9 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
10 giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or

13 2. A prosecuting attorney may request that a court impose bail
14 or a condition of release, or both, on a person. If the request includes
15 the imposition of bail, the prosecuting attorney must prove by clear
16 and convincing evidence that the imposition of bail is necessary to
17 protect the safety of the community or to ensure that the person will
18 appear at all times and places ordered by the court, with regard to
19 the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and 178.498.
20 3. If a court imposes bail or any condition of release, or both,
21 other than release on recognizance with no other conditions of
22 release, the court shall make findings of fact for such a
23 determination and state its reasoning on the record, and, if the
24 determination includes the imposition of a condition of release, the
25 findings of fact must include why the condition of release
26 constitutes the least restrictive means necessary to protect the safety
27 of the community or to ensure that the person will appear at the
28 times and places ordered by the court.
29 4. A person arrested for murder of the first degree may be
30 admitted to bail unless the proof is evident or the presumption great
31 by any competent court or magistrate authorized by law to do so in
32 the exercise of discretion, giving due weight to the evidence and to
33 the nature and circumstances of the offense.
34 5. There is a rebuttable presumption that the imposition of
35 bail on a person arrested for a violation of NRS 200.508,
36 200.5099, 202.265, 202.285, 202.287, 202.350, 202.360, paragraph
37 (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 205.060 or NRS 205.067 or a violent or
38 sexual offense is the least restrictive means necessary to protect
39 the safety of the community or to ensure that the person will
40 appear at all times and places ordered by the court.
41 6. The person must sign a document before the person’s release
42 stating that:
43 (a) The person will appear at all times and places as ordered by
44 the court releasing the person and as ordered by any court before
45 which the charge is subsequently heard;
-
*SB457*
– 51 –
1 (b) The person will comply with the other conditions which
2 have been imposed by the court and are stated in the document;
3 (c) If the person fails to appear when so ordered and is taken
4 into custody outside of this State, the person waives all rights
5 relating to extradition proceedings; and
6 (d) The person understands that any court of competent
7 jurisdiction may revoke the order of release without bail and may
8 order the person into custody or require the person to furnish bail or
9 otherwise ensure the protection of the safety of the community or
10 the person’s appearance, if applicable.
11 [6.] 7. The document signed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 must
12 be filed with the clerk of the court of competent jurisdiction and
13 becomes effective upon the signature of the person to be released.
14 [7.] 8. If a person fails to comply with a condition of release
15 imposed pursuant to this section, the court may, after providing the
16 person with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing:
17 (a) Deem such conduct a contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010;
18 (b) Impose such additional conditions of release as the court
19 deems necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure
20 the person will appear at the times and places ordered by the court;
21 (c) Increase the amount of bail pursuant to NRS 178.499, if
22 applicable; or
23 (d) Revoke bail and remand the person into custody.
24 [8.] 9. If a person fails to appear as ordered by the court and a
25 jurisdiction incurs any costs in returning a person to the jurisdiction
26 to stand trial, the person failing to appear is responsible for paying
27 those costs as restitution.
28 [9.] 10. An order issued pursuant to this section that imposes a
29 condition on a person must include a provision ordering a law
30 enforcement officer to arrest the person if the law enforcement
31 officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated a
32 condition of release.
33 [10.] 11. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a
34 court to receive the request of a prosecuting attorney before
35 imposing a condition of release.
36 12. As used in this section, “violent or sexual offense” has
37 the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 202.876.

43 the defendant, [if the court has not previously done so] unless [the
44 money deposited by the defendant as bail must be applied to satisfy

1 there are fines, costs or restitution associated with the judgment or

10 clerk under the direction of the court, shall apply the money in
11 satisfaction [thereof,] of any restitution and after satisfying the
12 restitution, any fine and costs .
13 2. If there is any surplus remaining after the distributions
14 required by subsection 1 are made, the court, or the clerk under
15 the direction of the court, shall refund the surplus [, if any,] to the
16 person who deposited the bail, unless that person has directed, in
17 writing, that any surplus be refunded to another.

27 immunity to compel the witness to testify or provide other
28 information.
29 2. If a court issues an order of immunity:

31 information on the basis of the privilege against self-

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who commits a crime under certain
2 specified circumstances may be subject to an additional penalty related to the
3 commission of the crime. (NRS 193.161-193.1685) Section 1 of this bill provides
4 that a person who is released on bail or conditions of release after being arrested for
5 a felony and while so released commits another felony, is subject to an additional
6 penalty. Section 40 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
7 establishment of the additional penalty and the aggregation of sentences.
8 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
9 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
10 Section 2 of this bill makes various changes to provide that stalking encompasses
11 both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and provides that such
12 penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of medium. Sections 50
13 and 63 of this bill make conforming changes related to section 2.
14 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
15 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
16 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of the sexual portrayal or engaging
17 in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty
18 of possession of pornography involving a minor. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 of this
19 bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that the
20 possession of each film, photograph or other visual representation constitutes a
21 separate offense. Section 41 of this bill makes a conforming change related to
22 section 3.
23 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is
24 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a
25 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a
26 firearm by certain persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having
27 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 178.4851, 202.360,
28 202.361) Sections 4, 30 and 51 of this bill require a court to schedule a compliance
29 hearing under certain circumstances to determine whether a person has complied
30 with a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 5, 31 and 52 of
31 this bill apply certain related definitions in existing law to sections 4, 30 and 51,
32 respectively.
33 Existing law provides that a person who, by day or night, unlawfully enters or
34 unlawfully remains in a dwelling, business structure, motor vehicle or other
35 structure is guilty of residential burglary, burglary of a business, burglary of a
36 motor vehicle or burglary of a structure, as applicable, and establishes
37 corresponding penalties for each type of burglary. (NRS 205.060) Section 7 of this
38 bill: (1) removes the requirement that a person unlawfully enter or unlawfully
39 remain in the dwelling, business structure, motor vehicle or other structure; and (2)
40 increases the penalties for burglary of a business, burglary of a motor vehicle and
41 burglary of a structure.
42 Existing law provides that a person who commits theft is subject to graduated
43 penalties depending on the value of the property or services involved in the theft. In
44 relevant part, existing law provides that a person is guilty of: (1) a misdemeanor if
45 the value of the property or services involved in the theft is less than $1,200; and
46 (2) a category D felony if the value of the property or services involved in the theft

29 176.035 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3,
30 whenever a person is convicted of two or more offenses, and
31 sentence has been pronounced for one offense, the court in imposing
32 any subsequent sentence may provide that the sentences
33 subsequently pronounced run either concurrently or consecutively
34 with the sentence first imposed. Except as otherwise provided in
35 subsections 3 and 4, if the court makes no order with reference
36 thereto, all such subsequent sentences run concurrently. For offenses
37 committed on or after July 1, 2014, if the court imposes the
38 sentences to run consecutively, the court must pronounce the
39 minimum and maximum aggregate terms of imprisonment pursuant
40 to subsection 2, unless the defendant is sentenced to life
41 imprisonment without the possibility of parole or death.
42 2. When aggregating terms of imprisonment pursuant to
43 subsection 1:
44 (a) If at least one sentence imposes a maximum term of
45 imprisonment for life with the possibility of parole, the court must
-
*SB457*

– 33 –
1 aggregate the minimum terms of imprisonment to determine the
2 minimum aggregate term of imprisonment, and the maximum
3 aggregate term of imprisonment shall be deemed to be
4 imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of
5 parole.
6 (b) If all the sentences impose a minimum and maximum
7 term of imprisonment, the court must aggregate the minimum
8 terms of imprisonment to determine the minimum aggregate term
9 of imprisonment and must aggregate the maximum terms of
10 imprisonment to determine the maximum aggregate term of
11 imprisonment.
12 3. Except as otherwise provided in this section [,] and subject
13 to the provisions of section 1 of this act, whenever a person under
14 sentence of imprisonment for committing a felony commits another
15 crime constituting a felony and is sentenced to another term of
16 imprisonment for that felony, the latter term must not begin until the
17 expiration of all prior terms, including the expiration of any prior
18 aggregated terms. If the person is a probationer at the time the
19 subsequent felony is committed, the court may provide that the latter
20 term of imprisonment run concurrently with any prior terms or
21 portions thereof.
22 4. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment
23 commits another crime constituting a misdemeanor or gross
24 misdemeanor, the court shall provide expressly whether the sentence
25 subsequently pronounced runs concurrently or consecutively with
26 the one first imposed.
27 5. Whenever a person under sentence of imprisonment
28 commits another crime for which the punishment is death or
29 imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, the sentence
30 must be executed without reference to the unexpired term of
31 imprisonment.
32 6. Regardless of whether a person is under sentence of
33 imprisonment, if the person commits another crime for which the

38 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act, the
39 sentence imposed for the additional penalty must be aggregated with
40 the sentence imposed for the underlying offense. A prisoner upon
41 whom a sentence for an additional penalty is imposed pursuant to
42 NRS 193.161 to 193.1685, inclusive, and section 1 of this act
43 before October 1, 2019, may elect to have the sentence imposed for
44 the additional penalty aggregated with the sentence imposed for the
-
*SB457*

– 34 –
1 underlying offense in accordance with subsection 5 of
2 NRS 213.1212.
3 8. This section does not prevent the State Board of Parole
4 Commissioners from paroling a person under consecutive sentences
5 of imprisonment from a current term of imprisonment to a
6 subsequent term of imprisonment.
7 9. This section must not be construed to prohibit the
8 aggregation of any sentences of imprisonment relating to different

33 to the provisions of subsection 3 remains subject to the provisions
34 for registration as a sex offender and to the provisions for

29 charge or judgment of conviction that is set aside is a conviction for
30 the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second or
31 subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is

37 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
38 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise

11 court or municipal court, as applicable [:
12 (a) Shall] , may discharge the defendant and dismiss the

14 unless the defendant:
15 [(1)] (a) Has been previously convicted in this State or in

22 other jurisdiction of a felony; or
23 (2) Has previously failed to complete a specialty court
24 program.]
25 7. Discharge and dismissal pursuant to this section is without
26 adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this
27 section or for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or
28 regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other public or
29 private purpose, but is a conviction for the purpose of additional
30 penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions or the
31 setting of bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the defendant, in the
32 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
33 indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter
34 under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false
35 statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge that arrest,

37 the defendant for any purpose.

45 charge or judgment of conviction that is set aside is a conviction for
-
*SB457*

1 the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second or
2 subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is
3 not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any
4 statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other
5 public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
6 judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
7 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
8 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
9 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
10 giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or
11 acknowledge that arrest, complaint, indictment, information or trial
12 in response to an inquiry made of the defendant for any purpose.

38 subsections 4 [,] and 5, the court shall only impose bail or a
39 condition of release, or both, on a person as it deems to be the least
40 restrictive means necessary to protect the safety of the community
41 or to ensure that the person will appear at all times and places
42 ordered by the court, with regard to the factors set forth in NRS
43 178.4853 and 178.498. Such conditions of release may include,
44 without limitation:
-
*SB457*

– 50 –
1 (a) Requiring the person to remain in this State or a certain
2 county within this State;
3 (b) Prohibiting the person from contacting or attempting to

11 may be harmful to the person’s own health, safety or welfare, or the
12 health, safety or welfare of another person.
13 2. A prosecuting attorney may request that a court impose bail
14 or a condition of release, or both, on a person. If the request includes
15 the imposition of bail, the prosecuting attorney must prove by clear
16 and convincing evidence that the imposition of bail is necessary to
17 protect the safety of the community or to ensure that the person will
18 appear at all times and places ordered by the court, with regard to
19 the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and 178.498.
20 3. If a court imposes bail or any condition of release, or both,
21 other than release on recognizance with no other conditions of
22 release, the court shall make findings of fact for such a
23 determination and state its reasoning on the record, and, if the
24 determination includes the imposition of a condition of release, the
25 findings of fact must include why the condition of release
26 constitutes the least restrictive means necessary to protect the safety
27 of the community or to ensure that the person will appear at the
28 times and places ordered by the court.
29 4. A person arrested for murder of the first degree may be
30 admitted to bail unless the proof is evident or the presumption great
31 by any competent court or magistrate authorized by law to do so in
32 the exercise of discretion, giving due weight to the evidence and to
33 the nature and circumstances of the offense.
34 5. There is a rebuttable presumption that the imposition of
35 bail on a person arrested for a violation of NRS 200.508,
36 200.5099, 202.265, 202.285, 202.287, 202.350, 202.360, paragraph
37 (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 205.060 or NRS 205.067 or a violent or
38 sexual offense is the least restrictive means necessary to protect
39 the safety of the community or to ensure that the person will
40 appear at all times and places ordered by the court.
41 6. The person must sign a document before the person’s release
42 stating that:
43 (a) The person will appear at all times and places as ordered by
44 the court releasing the person and as ordered by any court before
45 which the charge is subsequently heard;
-
*SB457*

– 51 –
1 (b) The person will comply with the other conditions which
2 have been imposed by the court and are stated in the document;
3 (c) If the person fails to appear when so ordered and is taken
4 into custody outside of this State, the person waives all rights
5 relating to extradition proceedings; and
6 (d) The person understands that any court of competent
7 jurisdiction may revoke the order of release without bail and may
8 order the person into custody or require the person to furnish bail or
9 otherwise ensure the protection of the safety of the community or
10 the person’s appearance, if applicable.
11 [6.] 7. The document signed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 must
12 be filed with the clerk of the court of competent jurisdiction and
13 becomes effective upon the signature of the person to be released.
14 [7.] 8. If a person fails to comply with a condition of release
15 imposed pursuant to this section, the court may, after providing the
16 person with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing:
17 (a) Deem such conduct a contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010;
18 (b) Impose such additional conditions of release as the court
19 deems necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure
20 the person will appear at the times and places ordered by the court;
21 (c) Increase the amount of bail pursuant to NRS 178.499, if
22 applicable; or
23 (d) Revoke bail and remand the person into custody.
24 [8.] 9. If a person fails to appear as ordered by the court and a
25 jurisdiction incurs any costs in returning a person to the jurisdiction
26 to stand trial, the person failing to appear is responsible for paying
27 those costs as restitution.
28 [9.] 10. An order issued pursuant to this section that imposes a
29 condition on a person must include a provision ordering a law
30 enforcement officer to arrest the person if the law enforcement
31 officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated a
32 condition of release.
