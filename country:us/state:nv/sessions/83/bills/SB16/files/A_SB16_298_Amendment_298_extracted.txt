2 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Existing law prohibits a person from submitting a
3 bid on a job in this State without the proper contractor’s license and establishes various
4 penalties for a person who engages in such conduct, including, without limitation, the
5 imposition of civil penalties, criminal penalties and administrative fines, the issuance of a
6 cease and desist order, the issuance of a citation and, if the person is a licensee, the imposition
7 of disciplinary action. (NRS 624.212, 624.3015, 624.302, 624.341, 624.700, 624.710,
8 624.740, 624.750) Additionally, existing law authorizes the Board to prohibit a person who
9 has been convicted of certain violations relating to acting as a contractor or submitting a bid

11 more than 6 months after the date of the conviction. (NRS 624.245) Section 1 of this bill
12 authorizes the Board to take certain additional actions against a person who is not a licensed

15 [without the proper license,] in violation of the provisions of existing law governing
16 contractors, and the value of the work to be performed is $1,000 or more, the Board is
17 authorized to refuse to issue the person a license [or, if the person is a licensee, refuse to
18 classify the person in an additional classification or subclassification,] for a period of not more
19 than 1 year after the date on which the person submitted the bid.
Senate Amendment No. 298 to Senate Bill No. 16 Page 4
20 Existing law sets forth certain acts and omissions that constitute grounds for disciplinary
21 action which the Board may impose against a contractor. (NRS 624.301-624.305) Section 2 of
22 this bill makes interfering or attempting to interfere with an investigation or disciplinary
23 proceeding of the Board or any other legal action to which the Board is a party, including,
24 without limitation, by threatening, harassing or otherwise influencing a person because the
25 person has provided or may provide evidence in the investigation, disciplinary proceeding or
26 legal action, grounds for such disciplinary action. Section 3 of this bill makes it unlawful for
27 any person to engage in such conduct and subjects a person who engages in such conduct to
28 graduated criminal penalties, depending on whether the offense is a first, second or third or
29 subsequent offense.
