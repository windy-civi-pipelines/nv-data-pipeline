Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the
2 State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Existing law prohibits a person
3 from submitting a bid on a job in this State without the proper contractor’s license
4 and establishes various penalties for a person who engages in such conduct,
5 including, without limitation, the imposition of civil penalties, criminal penalties
6 and administrative fines, the issuance of a cease and desist order, the issuance of a
7 citation and, if the person is a licensee, the imposition of disciplinary action. (NRS
8 624.212, 624.3015, 624.302, 624.341, 624.700, 624.710, 624.740, 624.750)

11 on a job without the proper license from taking an examination for a license for a
12 period of not more than 6 months after the date of the conviction. (NRS 624.245)
13 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board to take certain additional actions against
14 a person who submits a bid on certain jobs without the proper license. Under
15 section 1, if a person submits a bid on a job in this State without the proper license,
16 in violation of the provisions of existing law governing contractors, and the value
17 of the work to be performed is $1,000 or more, the Board is authorized to refuse to
18 issue the person a license or, if the person is a licensee, refuse to classify the person
19 in an additional classification or subclassification, for a period of not more than 1
20 year after the date on which the person submitted the bid.
21 Existing law sets forth certain acts and omissions that constitute grounds for
22 disciplinary action which the Board may impose against a contractor. (NRS
23 624.301-624.305) Section 2 of this bill makes interfering or attempting to interfere
24 with an investigation or disciplinary proceeding of the Board or any other legal
25 action to which the Board is a party, including, without limitation, by threatening,
26 harassing or otherwise influencing a person because the person has provided or
27 may provide evidence in the investigation, disciplinary proceeding or legal action,
28 grounds for such disciplinary action. Section 3 of this bill makes it unlawful for any
29 person to engage in such conduct and subjects a person who engages in such
30 conduct to graduated criminal penalties, depending on whether the offense is a first,
31 second or third or subsequent offense.
