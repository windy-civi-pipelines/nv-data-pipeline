AN ACT relating to public employees’ retirement; revising the
calculation of contribution rates to the Public Employees’
Retirement System from state employees and employers;
revising the contribution rates for the separate retirement
program provided by the Board of Regents of the
University of Nevada; making appropriations; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that certain public employees receive retirement
2 allowances through membership in and contributions to the Public Employees’
3 Retirement System. (Chapter 286 of NRS) Existing law requires that: (1) the
4 contribution rates of employees and employers to the System be adjusted every 2
5 years based on the actuarially determined contribution rate indicated in the biennial
6 actuarial valuation and report of the immediately preceding year, unless the existing
7 rate is higher or lower than the actuarially determined rate by a specified
8 percentage; and (2) the employee and employer are responsible for an equal portion
9 of any increase or decrease in the contribution rate. (NRS 286.410, 286.421,
10 286.450) Section 5 of this bill revises the contribution rate for an employee of a
11 participating state agency from a rate equal to that paid by the employer to one-half
12 of the normal cost that is actuarially determined for police officers and firefighters
13 and for regular members, depending on the retirement fund in which the member is
14 participating. Section 7 of this bill revises the employer contribution rate for a
15 participating state agency to be the total contribution rate actuarially determined for
16 police officers and firefighters and for regular members, depending on the
17 retirement fund in which the member is participating, less the employee
18 contribution rate of one-half of the normal costs determined pursuant to section 5.
19 Sections 5 and 7 also provide for the rounding of any adjusted contribution rate to
20 the nearest one-quarter of 1 percent.
21 Section 6 of this bill makes conforming changes to the Public Employees’
22 Retirement System to require, for purposes of the adjustment of salary increases
-

– 2 –
23 and cost-of-living increases or of salary reductions, that the division of total
24 contributions be determined in the same manner as provided for determining the
25 employee and employer contribution rates.
26 Section 3 of this bill defines the term “normal costs” as that portion of the
27 present value of projected benefits that is attributable to the current year of service,
28 as determined by an actuary of the System. Section 4 of this bill defines the term
29 “participating state agency” to mean the following public employers that participate
30 in the System: (1) an agency, bureau, board, commission, department, division,
31 officer or other unit of the Executive Branch of the State Government, the Nevada
32 System of Higher Education and the Public Employees’ Retirement System; (2) the
33 Legislative Branch of the State Government; and (3) the Judicial Branch of the
34 State Government.
35 Existing law requires the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to
36 provide a retirement program separate from the Public Employees’ Retirement
37 System which provides retirement benefits for members of the professional staff.
38 (NRS 286.802) Existing law further requires the Board of Regents and a participant
39 in the retirement program to each contribute an amount equal to 10 percent of the
40 participant’s gross compensation, but those contributions must not be less than the
41 contributions made for the Public Employees’ Retirement System. (NRS 286.808)
42 Section 8 of this bill eliminates that threshold and increases to 17.5 percent of a
43 participant’s gross compensation the amount that the Board of Regents and each
44 participant is required to contribute to the retirement program.
45 Sections 9-13 of this bill make appropriations for the purpose of meeting any
46 deficiencies between the money appropriated to the departments, commissions and
47 agencies of the State of Nevada for the 2023-2025 biennium and the increase in
48 employer contributions to the Public Employees’ Retirement System pursuant to
49 this bill.
