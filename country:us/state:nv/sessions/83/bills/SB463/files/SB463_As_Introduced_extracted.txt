EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; increasing the amount of anticipated
annual revenue from certain settlement agreements and
civil actions that may be used to pay the costs of
administering the Millennium Scholarship Trust Fund;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program
2 and creates the Millennium Scholarship Trust Fund to fund the Program. Existing
3 law requires the State Treasurer to deposit in the Millennium Scholarship Trust
4 Fund: (1) forty percent of all money received by the State of Nevada pursuant to
5 any settlement entered into by the State and a manufacturer of tobacco products;
6 and (2) forty percent of all money recovered by the State from a judgment in a civil
7 action against a manufacturer of tobacco products. Existing law authorizes up to 3
8 percent of the anticipated annual revenue to the State from the settlement
9 agreements with and civil actions against manufacturers of tobacco products
10 anticipated for deposit in the Millennium Scholarship Trust Fund to be used to pay
11 the costs of administering the Trust Fund. (NRS 396.926) Existing law also creates
12 the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund and an Endowment Account within the
13 Nevada College Savings Trust Fund. (NRS 353B.340) Existing law authorizes
14 money in Endowment Account to be expended for any purpose related to the
15 Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program, including the costs of
16 administering the Program, up to an amount equal to 3 percent of the anticipated
17 annual revenue to the State from the settlement agreements with and civil actions
18 against manufacturers of tobacco products anticipated for deposit in the Millennium
19 Scholarship Trust Fund. (NRS 353B.350) Between these two sources, existing law
20 therefore authorizes administrative funding for the Millennium Scholarship Trust
-
*SB463*
– 2 –
21 Fund up to 6 percent of the anticipated annual revenue to the State from the
22 settlement agreements with and civil actions against manufacturers of tobacco
23 products anticipated for deposit in the Trust Fund. This bill increases the amount of
24 the anticipated annual revenue to the State from the settlement agreements with and
25 civil actions against manufacturers of tobacco products anticipated for deposit in
26 the Millennium Scholarship Trust Fund which is authorized to be used from the
27 Trust Fund to pay the costs of administering the Trust Fund from 3 percent to 10
28 percent. This bill does not increase the amount of money in the Endowment
29 Account in the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund which may be used to pay for
30 the administrative costs of the Millennium Scholarship Trust Fund, thereby capping
31 the total administrative funding that is available between these sources at 13
32 percent of the anticipated annual revenue to the State from the settlement
33 agreements with and civil actions against manufacturers of tobacco products
34 anticipated for deposit in the Millennium Scholarship Trust Fund.
