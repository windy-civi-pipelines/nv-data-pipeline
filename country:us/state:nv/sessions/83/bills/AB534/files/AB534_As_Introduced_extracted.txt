Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved
2 electronic transmission through which voters may register to vote and apply for and
3 cast a ballot. (NRS 293D.200) Existing law further sets forth provisions governing
4 voting by persons who are detained in a county or city jail. (NRS 293.269971,
5 293.269973, 293.269975) Section 2 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to
6 allow: (1) an elector who is detained in a county or city jail to use the system of
7 approved electronic transmission established for covered voters who are overseas
8 or in the military to register to vote; and (2) a registered voter who is detained in a
9 county or city jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply
10 for and cast a ballot in every election where the system of approved electronic
11 transmission is available to a covered voter who is overseas or in the military.
12 Section 15 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the procedures to
13 be followed and the requirements of the use of the system of approved electronic
14 transmission by electors and voters who are detained in a county or city jail.
15 Section 21 of this bill requires the report submitted to the Secretary of State by a
16 person who administers a county or city jail concerning elections conducted in such
17 jails to include an explanation of the process the jail used to comply with the
18 provisions of section 2. (NRS 293.269975)
19 Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to
20 respond within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of
21 State for information or data relating to an election.
22 Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another
23 county and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an
24 application to register to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an
25 automatic voter registration agency, it shall be deemed that the voter is updating his
26 or her voter registration rather than registering to vote and, with certain exceptions,
27 the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on the basis of such an
28 update.
29 Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional
30 ballots by registered voters who update their voter registration information after the
31 close of registration for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or
32 by computer during certain periods of time leading up to and during an election.
33 Specifically, existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires an elector who is
34 deemed conditionally registered to vote under such circumstances to cast his or her
35 vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county or city clerk, under certain
36 circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration
37 to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887) Sections 5, 23,
38 26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to be
39 “conditional ballots.”
40 Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for
41 verification of the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such
42 submission. (NRS 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110)
43 Section 65 of this bill prohibits petitions for referendum and certain initiatives from
44 being submitted to a county clerk earlier than the 13th day following the primary or
45 general election, as appropriate. (NRS 295.056) Existing law requires, after the
46 submission of certain petitions containing signatures which are required to be
47 verified, the county clerk to determine the number of signatures affixed to the
48 documents and forward that information to the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.1276)
49 Section 6 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a
50 determination: (1) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office
51 of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
52 ballot, from 2 working days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which
53 is required to be submitted for such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working
54 days.

55 If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to
56 all the county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters
57 needed to declare the petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of
58 State to immediately notify the county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks,
59 after the receipt of such notification, to determine the number of registered voters
60 who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277) Section 7 of this bill increases the
61 time provided to a county clerk to make such a determination: (1) for a petition to
62 recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from 20 working days to 25
63 working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office
64 of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
65 ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which
66 is required to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working
67 days. Sections 8 and 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a
68 candidate for partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate
69 for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the county clerk for verification not
70 later than 25 working days, rather than 10 working days, before the last day to file
71 the petition.
72 Existing law provides that the period for filing a declaration of candidacy: (1)
73 for judicial candidates begins on the first Monday in January of the year in which
74 the election is to be held and ends the second Friday after the first Monday in
75 January; and (2) for all nonjudicial candidates begins on the first Monday in March
76 of the year in which the election is to be held and ends the second Friday after the
77 first Monday in March. (NRS 293.177, 293C.145, 293C.175) Sections 9-11, 58
78 and 59 of this bill instead provide that the period for filing a declaration of
79 candidacy for both judicial and nonjudicial candidates begins on the first Monday
80 in February of the year in which the election is to be held and ends not later than 5
81 p.m. on the second Friday after the first Monday in February. Section 9 similarly
82 revises the dates by which a minor political party is required by existing law to file
83 a list of its candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.1725) Section 11 further
84 provides that a petition of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan
85 office must not be filed earlier than the first Monday in February rather than the
86 first Monday in March.
87 Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning
88 elections in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073,
89 293.3576, 293.391, 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this
90 bill instead require the county clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the
91 county clerk deems proper, which may include, without limitation, publication in a
92 newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet website of the county clerk or on
93 the social media account of the county clerk.
94 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published
95 in a newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of
96 the State, together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire
97 text of a proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an
98 initiative petition. (Nev. Art. 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill
99 authorizes a county clerk to also publish such materials in any other manner as the
100 county clerk deems proper which may include, without limitation, publication on
101 the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county
102 clerk.
103 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not
104 inconsistent with the election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary,
105 presidential preference primary, general, special and district elections in all cities
106 and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
107 State to adopt regulations which provide standards for certain reports which are
108 required to be filed by a county or city clerk.

109 Section 16 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to require any deputy or
110 employee of the Office of the Secretary of State whose duties relate to elections to
111 attend the training course provided by the Secretary of State concerning elections
112 procedures. (NRS 293.2504)
113 Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting
114 the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the
115 board to complete the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day
116 following the election. (NRS 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this
117 bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the mail ballot central counting board to begin
118 counting the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; and (2)
119 require the mail central counting board to process each mail ballot on the day that
120 the mail ballot is received. Section 19 of this bill requires the Secretary of State,
121 rather than a county clerk, to establish procedures for the processing and counting
122 of mail ballots. (NRS 293.269925)
123 Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain
124 persons in the county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect
125 not to receive such a mail ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk
126 which must be received by the county clerk not later than 60 days before the day of
127 the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of this bill authorizes a voter who elects
128 not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a mail ballot for the election if
129 he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to the county clerk a
130 written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk.
131 Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the
132 elector is eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by
133 computer using the system established by the Secretary of State before the elector
134 appears at a polling place to vote in person. Existing law further requires an elector
135 who submits an application to register to vote in such a manner less than 14 days
136 before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837, 293.671) Section 41 of this
137 bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application less than 18 days
138 before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to prepare
139 and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or
140 her voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before
141 the election. (NRS 293.269911)
142 Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic
143 roster, to complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and
144 not later than 5 p.m. on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
145 personal appearance to ensure its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this
146 bill prohibits such a test from being completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2
147 weeks, before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance.
148 Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period provided in existing law for
149 a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical recording device
150 which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating equipment
151 and programs. (NRS 293B.150)
152 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for
153 purposes of certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to
154 challenge the right of a person to vote and provide that the term does not include
155 knowledge obtained from a third party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
156 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
157 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to
158 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the
159 completion of logic and accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of
160 the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170) Section 56 of this bill provides that such
161 materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election accuracy audit.
162 Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain
163 provisions relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election
-

164 includes, in any general election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns
165 for a candidate for United States Senator or Representative in Congress.
166 (NRS 293.403)
167 Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration
168 of a person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration
169 of certain electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section
170 34 of this bill requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of
171 a person if the county clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree
172 of consanguinity of the person, a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the
173 person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if the registration or preregistration of an
174 elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the county clerk later determines
175 that the registration or preregistration should not have been cancelled, the county
176 clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
177 Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain
178 elections that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential
179 preference primary election or general election is, if the person is registering by
180 appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities, the
181 fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election, presidential preference primary
182 election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this bill instead provides
183 that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the first day of
184 the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
185 revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and
186 special city election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general
187 city election. Section 37 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is
188 received not later than 5 days after the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to
189 accept the application if it is obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles and
190 is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early voting by personal
191 appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal
192 appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
193 Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on
194 the same day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or
195 special election by any method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the
196 recall or special election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last
197 day to register to vote for such a recall or special election: (1) by mail is the second
198 Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2) by appearing in person at the
199 office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is, depending on if there is a
200 period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the day before the
201 first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third Saturday
202 preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system
203 established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day
204 of the recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such
205 registration for such recall and special city elections.
206 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll
207 from certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain
208 exceptions, remaining inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with
209 the conduct of an election; and (2) in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking
210 to a voter on the subject of marking the voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
211 Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain
212 local governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or
213 mechanical recording device which is currently used in any election of this State is
214 provisional unless such an entity: (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to
215 transition to a new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device which
216 is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a contract for the purchase,
217 lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device.

218 Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register,
219 record and count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections
220 of any kind held in this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead
221 provides that ballots or votes: (1) may be cast, registered and recorded using a
222 mechanical voting system; and (2) must be counted using a mechanical voting
223 system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of this bill make conforming
224 changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for counting votes and
225 clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is authorized
226 but not required.
227 Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
228 Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election
229 which is set forth in existing law as the first Tuesday in February of each
230 presidential election year. (NRS 298.650)

15 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.5832, the voter

10 Sec. 7. NRS 293.1277 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 293.1277 1. If the Secretary of State finds that the total
12 number of signatures submitted to all the county clerks is 100
13 percent or more of the number of registered voters needed to declare
14 the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State shall immediately so
15 notify the county clerks. After the notification, each of the county
16 clerks shall determine the number of registered voters who have
17 signed the documents submitted in the county clerk’s county and, in
18 the case of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a
19 constitutional amendment or statewide measure, shall tally the
20 number of signatures for each petition district contained or fully
21 contained within the county clerk’s county. This determination must
22 be completed within [9] 14 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
23 holidays, after the notification pursuant to this subsection regarding
24 a petition containing signatures which are required to be verified
25 pursuant to NRS 293.128, 295.056, 298.109 or 306.110, within [20]
26 25 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the
27 notification pursuant to this subsection regarding a petition
28 containing signatures which are required to be verified pursuant to
29 NRS 306.035, and within [3] 8 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays
30 and holidays, after the notification pursuant to this subsection
31 regarding a petition containing signatures which are required to be
32 verified pursuant to NRS 293.172 or 293.200. For the purpose of
33 verification pursuant to this section, the county clerk shall not
34 include in his or her tally of total signatures any signature included
35 in the incorrect petition district.
36 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if more
37 than 500 names have been signed on the documents submitted to a
38 county clerk, the county clerk shall examine the signatures by
39 sampling them at random for verification. The random sample of
40 signatures to be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every
41 signature which has been submitted to the county clerk is given an
42 equal opportunity to be included in the sample. The sample must
43 include an examination of:
44 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), at least 500
45 or 5 percent of the signatures, whichever is greater.

3  If documents were submitted to the county clerk for more than
4 one petition district wholly contained within that county, a separate
5 random sample must be performed for each petition district.
6 3. If a petition district comprises more than one county and the
7 petition is for an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional
8 amendment or a statewide measure, and if more than 500 names
9 have been signed on the documents submitted for that petition
10 district, the appropriate county clerks shall examine the signatures
11 by sampling them at random for verification. The random sample of
12 signatures to be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every
13 signature which has been submitted to the county clerks within the
14 petition district is given an equal opportunity to be included in the
15 sample. The sample must include an examination of at least 500 or 5
16 percent of the signatures presented in the petition district, whichever
17 is greater. The Secretary of State shall determine the number of
18 signatures that must be verified by each county clerk within the
19 petition district.
20 4. If a petition is for the recall of a public officer who does not
21 hold a statewide office, each county clerk:
22 (a) Shall not examine the signatures by sampling them at
23 random for verification;
24 (b) Shall examine for verification every signature on the
25 documents submitted to the county clerk; and
26 (c) When determining the total number of valid signatures on
27 the documents, shall remove each name of a registered voter who
28 submitted a request to have his or her name removed from the
29 petition pursuant to NRS 306.015.
30 5. In determining from the records of registration the number
31 of registered voters who signed the documents, the county clerk may
32 use the signatures contained in the file of applications to register to
33 vote. If the county clerk uses that file, the county clerk shall ensure
34 that every application in the file is examined, including any
35 application in his or her possession which may not yet be entered
36 into the county clerk’s records. Except as otherwise provided in
37 subsection 6, the county clerk shall rely only on the appearance of
38 the signature and the address and date included with each signature
39 in making his or her determination.
40 6. If:
41 (a) A person registers to vote using the system established by
42 the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 293.671;
43 (b) A person registers to vote pursuant to NRS 293D.230 and
44 signs his or her application to register to vote using a digital

– 11 –
1 (c) A person is registered to vote by an automatic voter
2 registration agency,
3  the county clerk may rely on such other indicia as prescribed by
4 the Secretary of State in making his or her determination.
5 7. The county clerk shall allow 2 business days for a person
6 to cure any defect in a signature on the petition.
7 8. In the case of a petition for initiative or referendum
8 proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide measure, when
9 the county clerk is determining the number of registered voters who
10 signed the documents from each petition district contained fully or
11 partially within the county clerk’s county, he or she must use the
12 statewide voter registration list available pursuant to NRS 293.675.
13 [8.] 9. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [10,] 11,
14 upon completing the examination, the county clerk shall
15 immediately attach to the documents a certificate properly dated,
16 showing the result of the examination, including the tally of
17 signatures by petition district, if required, and transmit the
18 documents with the certificate to the Secretary of State. In the case
19 of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional
20 amendment or statewide measure, if a petition district comprises
21 more than one county, the appropriate county clerks shall comply
22 with the regulations adopted by the Secretary of State pursuant to
23 this section to complete the certificate. A copy of this certificate
24 must be filed in the clerk’s office. When the county clerk transmits
25 the certificate to the Secretary of State, the county clerk shall notify
26 the Secretary of State of the number of requests to remove a name
27 received by the county clerk pursuant to NRS 295.055 or pursuant
28 to NRS 306.015 for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a
29 statewide office, if applicable.
30 [9.] 10. A person who submits a petition to the county clerk
31 which is required to be verified pursuant to NRS 293.128, 293.172,
32 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035 or 306.110 must be allowed to
33 witness the verification of the signatures. A public officer who is the
34 subject of a recall petition must also be allowed to witness the
35 verification of the signatures on the petition.
36 [10.] 11. For any petition containing signatures which are
37 required to be verified pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.200,
38 306.035 or 306.110 for any county, district or municipal office
39 within one county, the county clerk shall not transmit to the
40 Secretary of State the documents containing the signatures of the
41 registered voters.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved
2 electronic transmission through which voters may register to vote and apply for and
3 cast a ballot. (NRS 293D.200) Existing law further sets forth provisions governing
4 voting by persons who are detained in a county or city jail. (NRS 293.269971,
5 293.269973, 293.269975) Section 2 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to
6 allow: (1) an elector who is detained in a county or city jail to use the system of
7 approved electronic transmission established for covered voters who are overseas
8 or in the military to register to vote; and (2) a registered voter who is detained in a
9 county or city jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply
10 for and cast a ballot in every election where the system of approved electronic
11 transmission is available to a covered voter who is overseas or in the military.
12 Section 15 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the procedures to
13 be followed and the requirements of the use of the system of approved electronic
14 transmission by electors and voters who are detained in a county or city jail.
15 Section 21 of this bill requires the report submitted to the Secretary of State by a
16 person who administers a county or city jail concerning elections conducted in such
17 jails to include an explanation of the process the jail used to comply with the
18 provisions of section 2. (NRS 293.269975)
19 Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to
20 respond within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of
21 State for information or data relating to an election.
22 Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another
23 county and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an
24 application to register to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an
25 automatic voter registration agency, it shall be deemed that the voter is updating his
26 or her voter registration rather than registering to vote and, with certain exceptions,
27 the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on the basis of such an
28 update.
29 Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional
30 ballots by registered voters who update their voter registration information after the
31 close of registration for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or
32 by computer during certain periods of time leading up to and during an election.
33 Specifically, existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires an elector who is
34 deemed conditionally registered to vote under such circumstances to cast his or her
35 vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county or city clerk, under certain
36 circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration
37 to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887) Sections 5, 23,
38 26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to be
39 “conditional ballots.”
40 Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for
41 verification of the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such
42 submission. (NRS 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110)
43 Section 65 of this bill prohibits petitions for referendum and certain initiatives from
44 being submitted to a county clerk earlier than the 13th day following the primary or
45 general election, as appropriate. (NRS 295.056) Existing law requires, after the
46 submission of certain petitions containing signatures which are required to be
47 verified, the county clerk to determine the number of signatures affixed to the
48 documents and forward that information to the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.1276)
49 Section 6 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a
50 determination: (1) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office
51 of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
52 ballot, from 2 working days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which
53 is required to be submitted for such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working
54 days.

*AB534*

– 3 –
55 If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to
56 all the county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters
57 needed to declare the petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of
58 State to immediately notify the county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks,
59 after the receipt of such notification, to determine the number of registered voters
60 who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277) Section 7 of this bill increases the
61 time provided to a county clerk to make such a determination: (1) for a petition to
62 recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from 20 working days to 25
63 working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office
64 of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
65 ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which
66 is required to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working
67 days. Sections 8 and 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a
68 candidate for partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate
69 for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the county clerk for verification not
70 later than 25 working days, rather than 10 working days, before the last day to file
71 the petition.
72 Existing law provides that the period for filing a declaration of candidacy: (1)
73 for judicial candidates begins on the first Monday in January of the year in which
74 the election is to be held and ends the second Friday after the first Monday in
75 January; and (2) for all nonjudicial candidates begins on the first Monday in March
76 of the year in which the election is to be held and ends the second Friday after the
77 first Monday in March. (NRS 293.177, 293C.145, 293C.175) Sections 9-11, 58
78 and 59 of this bill instead provide that the period for filing a declaration of
79 candidacy for both judicial and nonjudicial candidates begins on the first Monday
80 in February of the year in which the election is to be held and ends not later than 5
81 p.m. on the second Friday after the first Monday in February. Section 9 similarly
82 revises the dates by which a minor political party is required by existing law to file
83 a list of its candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.1725) Section 11 further
84 provides that a petition of candidacy for an independent candidate for partisan
85 office must not be filed earlier than the first Monday in February rather than the
86 first Monday in March.
87 Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning
88 elections in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073,
89 293.3576, 293.391, 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this
90 bill instead require the county clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the
91 county clerk deems proper, which may include, without limitation, publication in a
92 newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet website of the county clerk or on
93 the social media account of the county clerk.
94 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published
95 in a newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of
96 the State, together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire
97 text of a proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an
98 initiative petition. (Nev. Art. 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill
99 authorizes a county clerk to also publish such materials in any other manner as the
100 county clerk deems proper which may include, without limitation, publication on
101 the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county
102 clerk.
103 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not
104 inconsistent with the election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary,
105 presidential preference primary, general, special and district elections in all cities
106 and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
107 State to adopt regulations which provide standards for certain reports which are
108 required to be filed by a county or city clerk.

109 Section 16 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to require any deputy or
110 employee of the Office of the Secretary of State whose duties relate to elections to
111 attend the training course provided by the Secretary of State concerning elections
112 procedures. (NRS 293.2504)
113 Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting
114 the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the
115 board to complete the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day
116 following the election. (NRS 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this
117 bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the mail ballot central counting board to begin
118 counting the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; and (2)
119 require the mail central counting board to process each mail ballot on the day that
120 the mail ballot is received. Section 19 of this bill requires the Secretary of State,
121 rather than a county clerk, to establish procedures for the processing and counting
122 of mail ballots. (NRS 293.269925)
123 Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain
124 persons in the county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect
125 not to receive such a mail ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk
126 which must be received by the county clerk not later than 60 days before the day of
127 the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of this bill authorizes a voter who elects
128 not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a mail ballot for the election if
129 he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to the county clerk a
130 written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk.
131 Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the
132 elector is eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by
133 computer using the system established by the Secretary of State before the elector
134 appears at a polling place to vote in person. Existing law further requires an elector
135 who submits an application to register to vote in such a manner less than 14 days
136 before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837, 293.671) Section 41 of this
137 bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application less than 18 days
138 before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to prepare
139 and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or
140 her voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before
141 the election. (NRS 293.269911)
142 Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic
143 roster, to complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and
144 not later than 5 p.m. on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
145 personal appearance to ensure its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this
146 bill prohibits such a test from being completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2
147 weeks, before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance.
148 Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period provided in existing law for
149 a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical recording device
150 which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating equipment
151 and programs. (NRS 293B.150)
152 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for
153 purposes of certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to
154 challenge the right of a person to vote and provide that the term does not include
155 knowledge obtained from a third party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
156 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
157 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to
158 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the
159 completion of logic and accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of
160 the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170) Section 56 of this bill provides that such
161 materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election accuracy audit.
162 Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain
163 provisions relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election
-

164 includes, in any general election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns
165 for a candidate for United States Senator or Representative in Congress.
166 (NRS 293.403)
167 Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration
168 of a person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration
169 of certain electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section
170 34 of this bill requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of
171 a person if the county clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree
172 of consanguinity of the person, a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the
173 person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if the registration or preregistration of an
174 elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the county clerk later determines
175 that the registration or preregistration should not have been cancelled, the county
176 clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
177 Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain
178 elections that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential
179 preference primary election or general election is, if the person is registering by
180 appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities, the
181 fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election, presidential preference primary
182 election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this bill instead provides
183 that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the first day of
184 the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
185 revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and
186 special city election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general
187 city election. Section 37 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is
188 received not later than 5 days after the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to
189 accept the application if it is obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles and
190 is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early voting by personal
191 appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal
192 appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
193 Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on
194 the same day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or
195 special election by any method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the
196 recall or special election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last
197 day to register to vote for such a recall or special election: (1) by mail is the second
198 Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2) by appearing in person at the
199 office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is, depending on if there is a
200 period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the day before the
201 first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third Saturday
202 preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system
203 established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day
204 of the recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such
205 registration for such recall and special city elections.
206 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll
207 from certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain
208 exceptions, remaining inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with
209 the conduct of an election; and (2) in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking
210 to a voter on the subject of marking the voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
211 Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain
212 local governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or
213 mechanical recording device which is currently used in any election of this State is
214 provisional unless such an entity: (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to
215 transition to a new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device which
216 is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a contract for the purchase,
217 lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device.
-
*AB534*

– 6 –
218 Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register,
219 record and count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections
220 of any kind held in this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead
221 provides that ballots or votes: (1) may be cast, registered and recorded using a
222 mechanical voting system; and (2) must be counted using a mechanical voting
223 system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of this bill make conforming
224 changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for counting votes and
225 clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is authorized
226 but not required.
227 Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
228 Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election
229 which is set forth in existing law as the first Tuesday in February of each
230 presidential election year. (NRS 298.650)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 293 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
4 Secretary of State shall allow during the period of early voting and
5 on election day:
6 (a) An elector who is detained in a county or city jail to use the
7 system of approved electronic transmission established pursuant to
8 NRS 293D.200 to register to vote in every election where the
9 system of approved electronic transmission is available to a
10 covered voter to register to vote. The deadline for such an elector
11 to use the system of approved electronic transmission to register to
12 vote is the same as the deadline set forth in NRS 293D.230 for a
13 covered voter to register to vote.
14 (b) A registered voter who is in the custody of a county or city
15 jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission
16 established pursuant to NRS 293D.200 to apply for and cast a
17 ballot in every election where the system of approved electronic
18 transmission is available to a covered voter to request and cast a
19 military-overseas ballot. The deadlines for such a registered voter
20 to use the system of approved electronic transmission to request
21 and cast a ballot are the same as the deadlines set forth in NRS
22 293D.310 and 293D.400 for a covered voter to request and cast a
23 military-overseas ballot.
24 2. Upon receipt of an application and ballot cast by a person
25 pursuant to subsection 1 using the system of approved electronic
26 transmission established pursuant to NRS 293D.200, the local
27 elections official shall affix, mark or otherwise acknowledge
28 receipt of the application and ballot by means of a time stamp on
29 the application.

1 3. The Secretary of State shall ensure that an elector or a
2 registered voter may provide his or her digital signature or
3 electronic signature on any document or other material that is
4 necessary for the elector or registered voter to register to vote,
5 apply for a ballot or cast a ballot, as applicable.
6 4. The Secretary of State shall prescribe the form and content
7 of a declaration for use by an elector or a registered voter to swear
8 or affirm specific representations pertaining to identity, eligibility
9 to vote, status as such an elector or registered voter and timely and
10 proper completion of a ballot.
11 5. The Secretary of State shall prescribe the duties of the
12 county and city clerks upon receipt of a ballot sent by a registered

19 constitutional amendment or statewide measure, shall tally the

7 petition is for an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional
8 amendment or a statewide measure, and if more than 500 names
9 have been signed on the documents submitted for that petition
10 district, the appropriate county clerks shall examine the signatures

12 signatures to be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every

14 petition district is given an equal opportunity to be included in the
15 sample. The sample must include an examination of at least 500 or 5
16 percent of the signatures presented in the petition district, whichever
17 is greater. The Secretary of State shall determine the number of
18 signatures that must be verified by each county clerk within the
19 petition district.
20 4. If a petition is for the recall of a public officer who does not
21 hold a statewide office, each county clerk:
22 (a) Shall not examine the signatures by sampling them at

29 petition pursuant to NRS 306.015.
30 5. In determining from the records of registration the number
31 of registered voters who signed the documents, the county clerk may
32 use the signatures contained in the file of applications to register to
33 vote. If the county clerk uses that file, the county clerk shall ensure
34 that every application in the file is examined, including any
35 application in his or her possession which may not yet be entered
36 into the county clerk’s records. Except as otherwise provided in

14 upon completing the examination, the county clerk shall
15 immediately attach to the documents a certificate properly dated,
16 showing the result of the examination, including the tally of
17 signatures by petition district, if required, and transmit the
18 documents with the certificate to the Secretary of State. In the case
19 of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional
20 amendment or statewide measure, if a petition district comprises
21 more than one county, the appropriate county clerks shall comply
22 with the regulations adopted by the Secretary of State pursuant to
23 this section to complete the certificate. A copy of this certificate

35 verification of the signatures on the petition.

37 required to be verified pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.200,
38 306.035 or 306.110 for any county, district or municipal office
39 within one county, the county clerk shall not transmit to the

19 address of the residence where the candidate actually, as opposed to
20 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050, if one has
21 been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
22 for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
23 provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of
24 subsection 4:
25 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post
26 office box unless a street address has not been assigned to his or her
27 residence; and
28 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the candidate

39 the filing officer the proof of residency required by subsection 3
40 because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s
41 residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
42 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency
43 required by subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing
44 officer:
-
*AB534*

– 17 –
1 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
2 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;

4 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that
5 the filing officer determines is sufficient to verify where the
6 candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in
7 accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State may adopt
8 regulations establishing the forms of alternative proof of the
9 candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to
10 verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively,
11 resides in accordance with NRS 281.050.
12 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity
13 and residency provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or

21 pursuant to NRS 293.182. Service of such process must first be
22 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
23 the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at
24 that address, service must be made by personally delivering to and
25 leaving with the filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The
26 filing officer shall immediately send, by registered or certified mail,
27 one of the copies to the candidate at the specified address, unless the
28 candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer a different
29 address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail
30 the copy to the last address so designated.
31 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that
32 a candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
33 civil rights restored, the filing officer:
34 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the
35 candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
36 candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and
37 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from
