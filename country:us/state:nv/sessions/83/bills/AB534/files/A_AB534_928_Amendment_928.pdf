Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved electronic
2 transmission through which voters may register to vote and apply for and cast a ballot. (NRS
3 293D.200) Existing law further sets forth provisions governing voting by persons who are

Assembly Amendment No. 928 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 4
4 detained in a county or city jail. (NRS 293.269971, 293.269973, 293.269975) Section 2 of
5 this bill requires the Secretary of State to allow: (1) an elector who is detained in a county or
6 city jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission established for covered voters
7 who are overseas or in the military to register to vote; and (2) a registered voter who is
8 detained in a county or city jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply
9 for and cast a ballot in every election where the system of approved electronic transmission is
10 available to a covered voter who is overseas or in the military. Section 15 of this bill requires
11 the Secretary of State to prescribe the procedures to be followed and the requirements of the
12 use of the system of approved electronic transmission by electors and voters who are detained
13 in a county or city jail. Section 21 of this bill requires the report submitted to the Secretary of
14 State by a person who administers a county or city jail concerning elections conducted in such
15 jails to include an explanation of the process the jail used to comply with the provisions of
16 section 2. (NRS 293.269975)
17 Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to respond
18 within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of State for information
19 or data relating to an election.
20 Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another county
21 and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an application to register
22 to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an automatic voter registration agency, it
23 shall be deemed that the voter is updating his or her voter registration rather than registering to
24 vote and, with certain exceptions, the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on
25 the basis of such an update.
26 Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional ballots by
27 registered voters who update their voter registration information after the close of registration
28 for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or by computer during certain
29 periods of time leading up to and during an election. Specifically, existing law: (1) with
30 certain exceptions, requires an elector who is deemed conditionally registered to vote under
31 such circumstances to cast his or her vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county
32 or city clerk, under certain circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her
33 voter registration to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887)
34 Sections 5, 23, 26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to
35 be “conditional ballots.”
36 Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for verification of
37 the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such submission. (NRS
38 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110) Section 65 of this bill
39 prohibits petitions for referendum and certain initiatives from being submitted to a county
40 clerk earlier than the 13th day following the primary or general election, as appropriate. (NRS
41 295.056) Existing law requires, after the submission of certain petitions containing signatures
42 which are required to be verified, the county clerk to determine the number of signatures
43 affixed to the documents and forward that information to the Secretary of State. (NRS
44 293.1276) Section 6 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a
45 determination: (1) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office of a minor
46 political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot, from 2 working
47 days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which is required to be submitted for
48 such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working days.
49 If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to all the
50 county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters needed to declare the
51 petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to immediately notify the
52 county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks, after the receipt of such notification, to
53 determine the number of registered voters who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277)
54 Section 7 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a
55 determination: (1) for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from
56 20 working days to 25 working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for
57 partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
58 ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which is required
59 to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working days. Sections 8 and
60 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office of a minor
61 political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the

Assembly Amendment No. 928 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 5
62 county clerk for verification not later than 25 working days, rather than 10 working days,
63 before the last day to file the petition.
64 Existing law provides that the period for filing a declaration of candidacy: (1) for judicial
65 candidates begins on the first Monday in January of the year in which the election is to be held
66 and ends the second Friday after the first Monday in January; and (2) for all nonjudicial
67 candidates begins on the first Monday in March of the year in which the election is to be held
68 and ends the second Friday after the first Monday in March. (NRS 293.177, 293C.145,
69 293C.175) Sections 9-11, 58 and 59 of this bill instead provide that the period for filing a
70 declaration of candidacy for both judicial and nonjudicial candidates begins on the first
71 Monday in February of the year in which the election is to be held and ends not later than 5
72 p.m. on the second Friday after the first Monday in February. Section 9 similarly revises the
73 dates by which a minor political party is required by existing law to file a list of its candidates
74 for partisan office. (NRS 293.1725) Section 11 further provides that a petition of candidacy
75 for an independent candidate for partisan office must not be filed earlier than the first Monday
76 in February rather than the first Monday in March.
77 Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning elections
78 in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073, 293.3576, 293.391,
79 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this bill instead require the county
80 clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the county clerk deems proper, which may
81 include, without limitation, publication in a newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet
82 website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county clerk.
83 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published in a
84 newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of the State,
85 together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire text of a proposed
86 amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an initiative petition. (Nev. Art.
87 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill authorizes a county clerk to also publish such
88 materials in any other manner as the county clerk deems proper which may include, without
89 limitation, publication on the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media
90 account of the county clerk.
91 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the
92 election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary, presidential preference primary,
93 general, special and district elections in all cities and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of
94 this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations which provide standards for
95 certain reports which are required to be filed by a county or city clerk.
96 Section 16 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to require any deputy or employee
97 of the Office of the Secretary of State whose duties relate to elections to attend the training
98 course provided by the Secretary of State concerning elections procedures. (NRS 293.2504)
99 Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting the
100 received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the board to complete
101 the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day following the election. (NRS
102 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the
103 mail ballot central counting board to begin counting the received mail ballots 15 days before
104 the day of the election; and (2) require the mail central counting board to process each mail
105 ballot on the day that the mail ballot is received. Section 19 of this bill requires the Secretary
106 of State, rather than a county clerk, to establish procedures for the processing and counting of
107 mail ballots. (NRS 293.269925)
108 Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain persons in the
109 county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect not to receive such a mail
110 ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk which must be received by the county
111 clerk not later than 60 days before the day of the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of
112 this bill authorizes a voter who elects not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a
113 mail ballot for the election if he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to
114 the county clerk a written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk.
115 Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the elector is
116 eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by computer using the system
117 established by the Secretary of State before the elector appears at a polling place to vote in
118 person. Existing law further requires an elector who submits an application to register to vote
119 in such a manner less than 14 days before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837,
120 293.671) Section 41 of this bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application

Assembly Amendment No. 928 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 6
121 less than 18 days before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to
122 prepare and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or her
123 voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before the election.
124 (NRS 293.269911)
125 Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic roster, to
126 complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and not later than 5 p.m.
127 on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance to ensure
128 its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this bill prohibits such a test from being
129 completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2 weeks, before the first day of the period for early
130 voting by personal appearance. Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period
131 provided in existing law for a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical
132 recording device which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating
133 equipment and programs. (NRS 293B.150)
134 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for purposes of
135 certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to challenge the right of a
136 person to vote and provide that the term does not include knowledge obtained from a third
137 party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
138 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
139 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
140 audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the completion of logic and
141 accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170)
142 Section 56 of this bill provides that such materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of
143 an election accuracy audit.
144 Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain provisions
145 relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election includes, in any general
146 election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns for a candidate for United States
147 Senator or Representative in Congress. (NRS 293.403)
148 Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of a
149 person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration of certain
150 electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section 34 of this bill
151 requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of a person if the county
152 clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree of consanguinity of the person,
153 a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if
154 the registration or preregistration of an elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the
155 county clerk later determines that the registration or preregistration should not have been
156 cancelled, the county clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
157 Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain elections
158 that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential preference primary election or
159 general election is, if the person is registering by appearing in person at the office of the
160 county clerk or certain county facilities, the fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election,
161 presidential preference primary election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this
162 bill instead provides that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the
163 first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
164 revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and special city
165 election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general city election. Section 37
166 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is received not later than 5 days after
167 the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to accept the application if it is obtained from the
168 Department of Motor Vehicles and is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early
169 voting by personal appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
170 personal appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
171 Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on the same
172 day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or special election by any
173 method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the recall or special election. (NRS
174 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last day to register to vote for such a recall or
175 special election: (1) by mail is the second Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2)
176 by appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is,
177 depending on if there is a period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the
178 day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third
179 Saturday preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system

Assembly Amendment No. 928 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 7
180 established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day of the
181 recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such registration for such
182 recall and special city elections.
183 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll from
184 certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain exceptions, remaining
185 inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with the conduct of an election; and (2)
186 in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking to a voter on the subject of marking the
187 voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
188 Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain local
189 governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or mechanical recording
190 device which is currently used in any election of this State is provisional unless such an entity:
191 (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to transition to a new mechanical voting system or
192 mechanical recording device which is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a
193 contract for the purchase, lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical
194 recording device.
195 Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register, record and
196 count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections of any kind held in
197 this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead provides that ballots or votes: (1)
198 may be cast, registered and recorded using a mechanical voting system; and (2) must be
199 counted using a mechanical voting system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of
200 this bill make conforming changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for
201 counting votes and clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is
202 authorized but not required.
203 Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
204 Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election which is set
205 forth in existing law as the first Tuesday in February of each presidential election year. (NRS
206 298.650)
207 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to serve as the Chief Officer of Elections
208 for this State and to be responsible for the execution and enforcement of the provisions
209 of the Nevada Revised Statutes and all other provisions of state and federal law relating
210 to elections. (NRS 293.124) Section 69.4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to
211 establish and administer the Voter Access Grant Program to provide grants of money
212 from the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program which is created by section 69.6
213 of this bill to eligible entities to support the administration of elections and improve
214 voter access. For purposes of providing such grants, an “eligible entity” is defined by
215 section 69.6 to mean a county, city or tribal government.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

2 to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an application to register
3 to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an automatic voter registration
4 agency:
5 1. It shall be deemed that the voter is updating his or her voter registration
6 rather than registering to vote; and
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.5832, the voter must not be
8 required to, on the basis of the update to his or her address, cast a provisional

10 pursuant to NRS 293.5772 to 293.5887, inclusive.

22 within [2] 7 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the submission
23 of a petition containing signatures which are required to be verified pursuant to
24 NRS 293.172 or 293.200, the county clerk shall determine the total number of
25 signatures affixed to the documents and, in the case of a petition for initiative or
26 referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide measure, shall tally
27 the number of signatures for each petition district contained fully or partially within
28 the county and forward that information to the Secretary of State.
29 2. If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures filed with
30 all the county clerks is less than 100 percent of the required number of registered
31 voters, the Secretary of State shall so notify the person who submitted the petition
32 and the county clerks and no further action may be taken in regard to the petition. If
33 the petition is a petition to recall a county, district or municipal officer, the
34 Secretary of State shall also notify the officer with whom the petition is to be filed.
35 3. After the petition is submitted to the county clerk, it must not be handled
36 by any other person except by an employee of the county clerk’s office until it is
37 filed with the Secretary of State.
38 4. The Secretary of State may adopt regulations establishing procedures to
39 carry out the provisions of this section.
40 Sec. 7. NRS 293.1277 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 293.1277 1. If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of
42 signatures submitted to all the county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number
43 of registered voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State
44 shall immediately so notify the county clerks. After the notification, each of the
45 county clerks shall determine the number of registered voters who have signed the
46 documents submitted in the county clerk’s county and, in the case of a petition for
47 initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide
48 measure, shall tally the number of signatures for each petition district contained or
49 fully contained within the county clerk’s county. This determination must be
50 completed within [9] 14 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the
51 notification pursuant to this subsection regarding a petition containing signatures
52 which are required to be verified pursuant to NRS 293.128, 295.056, 298.109 or
53 306.110, within [20] 25 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the

Assembly Amendment No. 928 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 10
1 notification pursuant to this subsection regarding a petition containing signatures
2 which are required to be verified pursuant to NRS 306.035, and within [3] 8 days,
3 excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the notification pursuant to this
4 subsection regarding a petition containing signatures which are required to be
5 verified pursuant to NRS 293.172 or 293.200. For the purpose of verification
6 pursuant to this section, the county clerk shall not include in his or her tally of total
7 signatures any signature included in the incorrect petition district.
8 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if more than 500
9 names have been signed on the documents submitted to a county clerk, the county
10 clerk shall examine the signatures by sampling them at random for verification. The
11 random sample of signatures to be verified must be drawn in such a manner that
12 every signature which has been submitted to the county clerk is given an equal
13 opportunity to be included in the sample. The sample must include an examination
14 of:
15 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), at least 500 or 5 percent of
16 the signatures, whichever is greater.
17 (b) If the petition is for the recall of a public officer who holds a statewide
18 office, at least 25 percent of the signatures.
19  If documents were submitted to the county clerk for more than one petition
20 district wholly contained within that county, a separate random sample must be
21 performed for each petition district.
22 3. If a petition district comprises more than one county and the petition is for
23 an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or a statewide
24 measure, and if more than 500 names have been signed on the documents submitted
25 for that petition district, the appropriate county clerks shall examine the signatures
26 by sampling them at random for verification. The random sample of signatures to
27 be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every signature which has been
28 submitted to the county clerks within the petition district is given an equal
29 opportunity to be included in the sample. The sample must include an examination
30 of at least 500 or 5 percent of the signatures presented in the petition district,
31 whichever is greater. The Secretary of State shall determine the number of
32 signatures that must be verified by each county clerk within the petition district.
33 4. If a petition is for the recall of a public officer who does not hold a
34 statewide office, each county clerk:
35 (a) Shall not examine the signatures by sampling them at random for
36 verification;
37 (b) Shall examine for verification every signature on the documents submitted
38 to the county clerk; and
39 (c) When determining the total number of valid signatures on the documents,
40 shall remove each name of a registered voter who submitted a request to have his or
41 her name removed from the petition pursuant to NRS 306.015.
42 5. In determining from the records of registration the number of registered
43 voters who signed the documents, the county clerk may use the signatures
44 contained in the file of applications to register to vote. If the county clerk uses that
45 file, the county clerk shall ensure that every application in the file is examined,
46 including any application in his or her possession which may not yet be entered into
47 the county clerk’s records. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
48 clerk shall rely only on the appearance of the signature and the address and date
49 included with each signature in making his or her determination.
50 6. If:
51 (a) A person registers to vote using the system established by the Secretary of
52 State pursuant to NRS 293.671;

Assembly Amendment No. 928 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 11
1 (b) A person registers to vote pursuant to NRS 293D.230 and signs his or her
2 application to register to vote using a digital signature or an electronic signature; or
3 (c) A person is registered to vote by an automatic voter registration agency,
4  the county clerk may rely on such other indicia as prescribed by the Secretary of
5 State in making his or her determination.
6 7. The county clerk shall allow 2 business days for a person to cure any
7 defect in a signature on the petition.
8 8. In the case of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a
9 constitutional amendment or statewide measure, when the county clerk is
10 determining the number of registered voters who signed the documents from each
11 petition district contained fully or partially within the county clerk’s county, he or
12 she must use the statewide voter registration list available pursuant to NRS
13 293.675.
14 [8.] 9. Except as otherwise provided in subsection [10,] 11, upon completing
15 the examination, the county clerk shall immediately attach to the documents a
16 certificate properly dated, showing the result of the examination, including the tally
17 of signatures by petition district, if required, and transmit the documents with the
18 certificate to the Secretary of State. In the case of a petition for initiative or
19 referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide measure, if a
20 petition district comprises more than one county, the appropriate county clerks shall
21 comply with the regulations adopted by the Secretary of State pursuant to this
22 section to complete the certificate. A copy of this certificate must be filed in the
23 clerk’s office. When the county clerk transmits the certificate to the Secretary of
24 State, the county clerk shall notify the Secretary of State of the number of requests
25 to remove a name received by the county clerk pursuant to NRS 295.055 or
26 pursuant to NRS 306.015 for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a
27 statewide office, if applicable.

30 306.035 or 306.110 must be allowed to witness the verification of the signatures. A
31 public officer who is the subject of a recall petition must also be allowed to witness
32 the verification of the signatures on the petition.
33 [10.] 11. For any petition containing signatures which are required to be
34 verified pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.200, 306.035 or 306.110 for any
35 county, district or municipal office within one county, the county clerk shall not
36 transmit to the Secretary of State the documents containing the signatures of the
37 registered voters.
38 [11.] 12. The Secretary of State shall by regulation establish further
39 procedures for carrying out the provisions of this section.

9 candidacy pursuant to subsection 2 must be the street address of the residence
10 where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in accordance
11 with NRS 281.050, if one has been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not
12 be accepted for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following provisions
13 of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of subsection 4:
14 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post office box

27 the candidate’s residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
28 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency required by
29 subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing officer:
30 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a governmental
31 agency that contains a photograph of the candidate; and
32 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that the filing
33 officer determines is sufficient to verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to
34 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State

48 address, service must be made by personally delivering to and leaving with the
49 filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The filing officer shall immediately
50 send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies to the candidate at the
51 specified address, unless the candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer
52 a different address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail the

2 has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her civil rights restored, the

5 convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the candidate has had his or her civil rights
6 restored; and
7 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from such
