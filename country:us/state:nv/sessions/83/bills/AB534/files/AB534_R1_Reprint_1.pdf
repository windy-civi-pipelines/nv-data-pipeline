Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to
2 respond within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of
3 State for information or data relating to the current election cycle.
4 Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another
5 county and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an
6 application to register to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an
7 automatic voter registration agency, it shall be deemed that the voter is updating his
8 or her voter registration rather than registering to vote and, with certain exceptions,
9 the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on the basis of such an
10 update.
11 Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional
12 ballots by registered voters who update their voter registration information after the
13 close of registration for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or
14 by computer during certain periods of time leading up to and during an election.
15 Specifically, existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires an elector who is
16 deemed conditionally registered to vote under such circumstances to cast his or her
17 vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county or city clerk, under certain
18 circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration
19 to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887) Sections 5, 23,
20 26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to be
21 “conditional ballots.”
22 Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for
23 verification of the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such
24 submission. (NRS 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110)
25 Section 65 of this bill authorizes a county clerk, under certain circumstances, to
26 delay beginning verification for petitions for referendum and certain initiatives.
27 (NRS 295.056) Existing law requires, after the submission of certain petitions
28 containing signatures which are required to be verified, the county clerk to
29 determine the number of signatures affixed to the documents and forward that
30 information to the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.1276) Section 6 of this bill
31 increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a determination: (1) for
32 a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office of a minor political
33 party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot, from 2 working
34 days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which is required to be
35 submitted for such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working days.
36 If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to
37 all the county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters
38 needed to declare the petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of
39 State to immediately notify the county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks,
40 after the receipt of such notification, to determine the number of registered voters
41 who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277) Section 7 of this bill increases the
42 time provided to a county clerk to make such a determination: (1) for a petition to
43 recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from 20 working days to 25
44 working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office
45 of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
46 ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which
47 is required to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working
48 days. Sections 8 and 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a
49 candidate for partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate
50 for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the county clerk for verification or
51 filing, respectively, not later than 25 working days, rather than 10 working days,
52 before the last day to file the petition.
53 Existing law requires that the petition of candidacy for an independent
54 candidate for partisan office be filed not earlier than the first Monday in March of
55 the year in which the election is to be held and not later than the third Friday in
-
*AB534_R1*

– 3 –
56 June. (NRS 293.200) Section 11 instead provides that a petition of candidacy for an
57 independent candidate for partisan office must not be filed earlier than the second
58 Monday after the primary election and not later than the third Friday after the
59 primary election. Section 11 additionally: (1) requires such a petition to be
60 submitted to the county clerk for verification during this period of time; and (2)
61 provides that if such a petition is submitted in a timely manner but the Secretary of
62 State receives certificates from the county clerks showing the petition has met
63 certain requirements after this deadline, the petition is deemed to be timely filed.
64 Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning
65 elections in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073,
66 293.3576, 293.391, 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this
67 bill instead require the county clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the
68 county clerk deems proper, which may include, without limitation, publication in a
69 newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet website of the county clerk or on
70 the social media account of the county clerk.
71 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published
72 in a newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of
73 the State, together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire
74 text of a proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an
75 initiative petition. (Nev. Art. 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill
76 authorizes a county clerk to also publish such materials in any other manner as the
77 county clerk deems proper which may include, without limitation, publication on
78 the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county
79 clerk.
80 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not
81 inconsistent with the election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary,
82 presidential preference primary, general, special and district elections in all cities
83 and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
84 State to adopt regulations which provide standards for certain reports which are
85 required to be filed by a county or city clerk.
86 Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting
87 the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the
88 board to complete the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day
89 following the election. (NRS 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this
90 bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the mail ballot central counting board to begin
91 counting the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; and (2)
92 require the mail ballot central counting board to process each mail ballot within 24
93 hours after receipt of the mail ballot unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary of
94 State. Sections 19 and 60 of this bill require the Secretary of State, rather than a
95 county or city clerk, to establish procedures for minimum requirements for the
96 processing and counting of mail ballots. (NRS 293.269925, 293C.26325)
97 Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain
98 persons in the county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect
99 not to receive such a mail ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk
100 which must be received by the county clerk not later than 60 days before the day of
101 the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of this bill authorizes a voter who elects
102 not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a mail ballot for the election if
103 he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to the county clerk a
104 written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk. Sections 18 and 59.5 of
105 this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to each registered voter
106 who resides within the State from not later than 20 days before the election to
107 instead on or after the fifth Monday before the election but not later than the fourth
108 Monday before the election.
109 Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the
110 elector is eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by
111 computer using the system established by the Secretary of State before the elector
-

– 4 –
112 appears at a polling place to vote in person. Existing law further requires an elector
113 who submits an application to register to vote in such a manner less than 14 days
114 before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837, 293.671) Section 41 of this
115 bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application less than 18 days
116 before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to prepare
117 and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or
118 her voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before
119 the election. (NRS 293.269911)
120 Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic
121 roster, to complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and
122 not later than 5 p.m. on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
123 personal appearance to ensure its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this
124 bill prohibits such a test from being completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2
125 weeks, before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance.
126 Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period provided in existing law for
127 a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical recording device
128 which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating equipment
129 and programs. (NRS 293B.150)
130 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for
131 purposes of certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to
132 challenge the right of a person to vote and provide that the term does not include
133 knowledge obtained from a third party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
134 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
135 results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to
136 “election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the
137 completion of logic and accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of
138 the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170) Section 56 of this bill provides that such
139 materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election accuracy audit.
140 Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain
141 provisions relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election
142 includes, in any general election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns
143 for a candidate for United States Senator or Representative in Congress.
144 (NRS 293.403)
145 Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration
146 of a person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration
147 of certain electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section
148 34 of this bill requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of
149 a person if the county clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree
150 of consanguinity of the person, a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the
151 person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if the registration or preregistration of an
152 elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the county clerk later determines
153 that the registration or preregistration should not have been cancelled, the county
154 clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
155 Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain
156 elections that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential
157 preference primary election or general election is, if the person is registering by
158 appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities, the
159 fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election, presidential preference primary
160 election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this bill instead provides
161 that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the first day of
162 the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
163 revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and
164 special city election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general
165 city election. Section 37 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is
166 received not later than 5 days after the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to
167 accept the application if it is obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles and
-

168 is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early voting by personal
169 appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal
170 appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
171 Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on
172 the same day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or
173 special election by any method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the
174 recall or special election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last
175 day to register to vote for such a recall or special election: (1) by mail is the second
176 Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2) by appearing in person at the
177 office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is, depending on if there is a
178 period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the day before the
179 first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third Saturday
180 preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system
181 established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day
182 of the recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such
183 registration for such recall and special city elections.
184 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll
185 from certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain
186 exceptions, remaining inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with
187 the conduct of an election; and (2) in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking
188 to a voter on the subject of marking the voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
189 Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain
190 local governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or
191 mechanical recording device which is currently used in any election of this State is
192 provisional unless such an entity: (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to
193 transition to a new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device which
194 is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a contract for the purchase,
195 lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device.
196 Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register,
197 record and count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections
198 of any kind held in this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead
199 provides that ballots or votes: (1) may be cast, registered and recorded using a
200 mechanical voting system; and (2) must be counted using a mechanical voting
201 system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of this bill make conforming
202 changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for counting votes and
203 clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is authorized
204 but not required.
205 Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
206 Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election
207 which is set forth in existing law as the first Tuesday in February of each
208 presidential election year. (NRS 298.650)
209 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to serve as the Chief Officer of
210 Elections for this State and to be responsible for the execution and enforcement of
211 the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes and all other provisions of state and
212 federal law relating to elections. (NRS 293.124) Section 69.4 of this bill requires
213 the Secretary of State to establish and administer the Voter Access Grant Program
214 to provide grants of money from the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program
215 which is created by section 69.6 of this bill to eligible entities to support the
216 administration of elections and improve voter access. For purposes of providing
217 such grants, an “eligible entity” is defined by section 69.6 to mean a county, city or
218 tribal government.

14 petition is for an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional
15 amendment or a statewide measure, and if more than 500 names

25 signatures that must be verified by each county clerk within the
26 petition district.
27 4. If a petition is for the recall of a public officer who does not
28 hold a statewide office, each county clerk:

41 that every application in the file is examined, including any
42 application in his or her possession which may not yet be entered
43 into the county clerk’s records. Except as otherwise provided in
44 subsection 6, the county clerk shall rely only on the appearance of
