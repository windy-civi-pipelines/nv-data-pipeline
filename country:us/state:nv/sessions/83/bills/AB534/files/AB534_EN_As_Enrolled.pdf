Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to
respond within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of
State for information or data relating to the current election cycle.
Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another
county and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an
application to register to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an
automatic voter registration agency, it shall be deemed that the voter is updating his
or her voter registration rather than registering to vote and, with certain exceptions,
the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on the basis of such an
update.
Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional
ballots by registered voters who update their voter registration information after the
close of registration for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or
by computer during certain periods of time leading up to and during an election.
Specifically, existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires an elector who is
deemed conditionally registered to vote under such circumstances to cast his or her
vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county or city clerk, under certain
circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her voter registration
to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887) Sections 5, 23,
26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to be
“conditional ballots.”
Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for
verification of the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such
submission. (NRS 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110)
Section 65 of this bill authorizes a county clerk, under certain circumstances, to
-

delay beginning verification for petitions for referendum and certain initiatives.
(NRS 295.056) Existing law requires, after the submission of certain petitions
containing signatures which are required to be verified, the county clerk to
determine the number of signatures affixed to the documents and forward that
information to the Secretary of State. (NRS 293.1276) Section 6 of this bill
increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a determination: (1) for
a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office of a minor political
party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot, from 2 working
days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which is required to be
submitted for such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working days.
If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to
all the county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters
needed to declare the petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of
State to immediately notify the county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks,
after the receipt of such notification, to determine the number of registered voters
who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277) Section 7 of this bill increases the
time provided to a county clerk to make such a determination: (1) for a petition to
recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from 20 working days to 25
working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office
of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which
is required to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working
days. Sections 8 and 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a
candidate for partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate
for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the county clerk for verification or
filing, respectively, not later than 25 working days, rather than 10 working days,
before the last day to file the petition.
Existing law requires that the petition of candidacy for an independent
candidate for partisan office be filed not earlier than the first Monday in March of
the year in which the election is to be held and not later than the third Friday in
June. (NRS 293.200) Section 11 instead provides that a petition of candidacy for an
independent candidate for partisan office must not be filed earlier than the second
Monday after the primary election and not later than the third Friday after the
primary election. Section 11 additionally: (1) requires such a petition to be
submitted to the county clerk for verification during this period of time; and (2)
provides that if such a petition is submitted in a timely manner but the Secretary of
State receives certificates from the county clerks showing the petition has met
certain requirements after this deadline, the petition is deemed to be timely filed.
Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning
elections in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073,
293.3576, 293.391, 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this
bill instead require the county clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the
county clerk deems proper, which may include, without limitation, publication in a
newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet website of the county clerk or on
the social media account of the county clerk.
Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published
in a newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of
the State, together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire
text of a proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an
initiative petition. (Nev. Art. 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill
authorizes a county clerk to also publish such materials in any other manner as the
county clerk deems proper which may include, without limitation, publication on
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county
clerk.
Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not
inconsistent with the election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary,
presidential preference primary, general, special and district elections in all cities
and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
State to adopt regulations which provide standards for certain reports which are
required to be filed by a county or city clerk.
Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting
the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the
board to complete the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day
following the election. (NRS 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this
bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the mail ballot central counting board to begin
counting the received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election; and (2)
require the mail ballot central counting board to process each mail ballot within 24
hours after receipt of the mail ballot unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary of
State. Sections 19 and 60 of this bill require the Secretary of State, rather than a
county or city clerk, to establish procedures for minimum requirements for the
processing and counting of mail ballots. (NRS 293.269925, 293C.26325)
Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain
persons in the county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect
not to receive such a mail ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk
which must be received by the county clerk not later than 60 days before the day of
the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of this bill authorizes a voter who elects
not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a mail ballot for the election if
he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to the county clerk a
written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk. Sections 18 and 59.5 of
this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to each registered voter
who resides within the State from not later than 20 days before the election to
instead on or after the fifth Monday before the election but not later than the fourth
Monday before the election.
Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the
elector is eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by
computer using the system established by the Secretary of State before the elector
appears at a polling place to vote in person. Existing law further requires an elector
who submits an application to register to vote in such a manner less than 14 days
before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837, 293.671) Section 41 of this
bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application less than 18 days
before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to prepare
and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or
her voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before
the election. (NRS 293.269911)
Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic
roster, to complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and
not later than 5 p.m. on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
personal appearance to ensure its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this
bill prohibits such a test from being completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2
weeks, before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance.
Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period provided in existing law for
a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical recording device
which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating equipment
and programs. (NRS 293B.150)

Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for
purposes of certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to
challenge the right of a person to vote and provide that the term does not include
knowledge obtained from a third party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the
results of an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to
“election accuracy audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the
completion of logic and accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of
the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170) Section 56 of this bill provides that such
materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of an election accuracy audit.
Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain
provisions relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election
includes, in any general election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns
for a candidate for United States Senator or Representative in Congress.
(NRS 293.403)
Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration
of a person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration
of certain electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section
34 of this bill requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of
a person if the county clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree
of consanguinity of the person, a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the
person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if the registration or preregistration of an
elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the county clerk later determines
that the registration or preregistration should not have been cancelled, the county
clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain
elections that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential
preference primary election or general election is, if the person is registering by
appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities, the
fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election, presidential preference primary
election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this bill instead provides
that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the first day of
the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and
special city election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general
city election. Section 37 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is
received not later than 5 days after the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to
accept the application if it is obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles and
is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early voting by personal
appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal
appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on
the same day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or
special election by any method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the
recall or special election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last
day to register to vote for such a recall or special election: (1) by mail is the second
Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2) by appearing in person at the
office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is, depending on if there is a
period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the day before the
first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third Saturday
preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system
established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day
-

– 5 –
of the recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such
registration for such recall and special city elections.
Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll
from certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain
exceptions, remaining inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with
the conduct of an election; and (2) in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking
to a voter on the subject of marking the voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain
local governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or
mechanical recording device which is currently used in any election of this State is
provisional unless such an entity: (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to
transition to a new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device which
is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a contract for the purchase,
lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical recording device.
Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register,
record and count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections
of any kind held in this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead
provides that ballots or votes: (1) may be cast, registered and recorded using a
mechanical voting system; and (2) must be counted using a mechanical voting
system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of this bill make conforming
changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for counting votes and
clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is authorized
but not required.
Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election
which is set forth in existing law as the first Tuesday in February of each
presidential election year. (NRS 298.650)
Existing law requires the Secretary of State to serve as the Chief Officer of
Elections for this State and to be responsible for the execution and enforcement of
the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes and all other provisions of state and
federal law relating to elections. (NRS 293.124) Section 69.4 of this bill requires
the Secretary of State to establish and administer the Voter Access Grant Program
to provide grants of money from the Account for the Voter Access Grant Program
which is created by section 69.6 of this bill to eligible entities to support the
administration of elections and improve voter access. For purposes of providing
such grants, an “eligible entity” is defined by section 69.6 to mean a county, city or
tribal government.

the case of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a
constitutional amendment or statewide measure, shall tally the
number of signatures for each petition district contained or fully

3. If a petition district comprises more than one county and the
petition is for an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional
amendment or a statewide measure, and if more than 500 names
have been signed on the documents submitted for that petition
district, the appropriate county clerks shall examine the signatures
by sampling them at random for verification. The random sample of
signatures to be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every
