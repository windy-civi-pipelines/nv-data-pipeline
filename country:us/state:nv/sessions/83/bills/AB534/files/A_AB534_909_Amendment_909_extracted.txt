Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved electronic
2 transmission through which voters may register to vote and apply for and cast a ballot. (NRS
3 293D.200) Existing law further sets forth provisions governing voting by persons who are
4 detained in a county or city jail. (NRS 293.269971, 293.269973, 293.269975) Section 2 of this
Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 4
5 bill requires the Secretary of State to allow: (1) an elector who is detained in a county or city
6 jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission established for covered voters who
7 are overseas or in the military to register to vote; and (2) a registered voter who is detained in
8 a county or city jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply for and cast
9 a ballot in every election where the system of approved electronic transmission is available to
10 a covered voter who is overseas or in the military. Section 15 of this bill requires the Secretary
11 of State to prescribe the procedures to be followed and the requirements of the use of the
12 system of approved electronic transmission by electors and voters who are detained in a
13 county or city jail. Section 21 of this bill requires the report submitted to the Secretary of State
14 by a person who administers a county or city jail concerning elections conducted in such jails
15 to include an explanation of the process the jail used to comply with the provisions of section
16 2. (NRS 293.269975)]
17 Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to respond
18 within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of State for information
19 or data relating to [an] the current election [.] cycle.
20 Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another county
21 and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an application to register
22 to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an automatic voter registration agency, it
23 shall be deemed that the voter is updating his or her voter registration rather than registering to
24 vote and, with certain exceptions, the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on
25 the basis of such an update.
26 Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional ballots by
27 registered voters who update their voter registration information after the close of registration
28 for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or by computer during certain
29 periods of time leading up to and during an election. Specifically, existing law: (1) with
30 certain exceptions, requires an elector who is deemed conditionally registered to vote under
31 such circumstances to cast his or her vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county
32 or city clerk, under certain circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her
33 voter registration to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887)
34 Sections 5, 23, 26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to
35 be “conditional ballots.”
36 Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for verification of
37 the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such submission. (NRS
38 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110) Section 65 of this bill
39 [prohibits] authorizes a county clerk, under certain circumstances, to delay beginning
40 verification for petitions for referendum and certain initiatives . [from being submitted to a
41 county clerk earlier than the 13th day following the primary or general election, as
42 appropriate.] (NRS 295.056) Existing law requires, after the submission of certain petitions
43 containing signatures which are required to be verified, the county clerk to determine the
44 number of signatures affixed to the documents and forward that information to the Secretary
45 of State. (NRS 293.1276) Section 6 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to
46 make such a determination: (1) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan
47 office of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot,
48 from 2 working days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which is required to be
49 submitted for such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working days.
50 If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to all the
51 county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters needed to declare the
52 petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to immediately notify the
53 county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks, after the receipt of such notification, to
54 determine the number of registered voters who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277)
55 Section 7 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a
56 determination: (1) for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from
57 20 working days to 25 working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for
58 partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
59 ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which is required
60 to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working days. Sections 8 and
61 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office of a minor
62 political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the
Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 5
63 county clerk for verification or filing, respectively, not later than 25 working days, rather
64 than 10 working days, before the last day to file the petition.
65 Existing law [provides] requires that the [period for filing a declaration] petition of
66 candidacy [: (1) for judicial candidates begins on the first Monday in January of the year in
67 which the election is to be held and ends the second Friday after the first Monday in January;
68 and (2) for all nonjudicial candidates begins on] for an independent candidate for partisan
69 office be filed not earlier than the first Monday in March of the year in which the election is
70 to be held and [ends] not later than the [second] third Friday [after the first Monday] in
71 [March. (NRS 293.177, 293C.145, 293C.175) Sections 9-11, 58 and 59 of this bill instead
72 provide that the period for filing a declaration of candidacy for both judicial and nonjudicial
73 candidates begins on the first Monday in February of the year in which the election is to be
74 held and ends not later than 5 p.m. on the second Friday after the first Monday in February.
75 Section 9 similarly revises the dates by which a minor political party is required by existing
76 law to file a list of its candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.1725)] June. (NRS 293.200)
77 Section 11 [further] instead provides that a petition of candidacy for an independent
78 candidate for partisan office must not be filed earlier than the [first] second Monday [in
79 February rather] after the primary election and not later than the [first Monday in March.]
80 third Friday after the primary election. Section 11 additionally: (1) requires such a
81 petition to be submitted to the county clerk for verification during this period of time;
82 and (2) provides that if such a petition is submitted in a timely manner but the Secretary
83 of State receives certificates from the county clerks showing the petition has met certain
84 requirements after this deadline, the petition is deemed to be timely filed.
85 Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning elections
86 in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073, 293.3576, 293.391,
87 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this bill instead require the county
88 clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the county clerk deems proper, which may
89 include, without limitation, publication in a newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet
90 website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county clerk.
91 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published in a
92 newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of the State,
93 together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire text of a proposed
94 amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an initiative petition. (Nev. Art.
95 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill authorizes a county clerk to also publish such
96 materials in any other manner as the county clerk deems proper which may include, without
97 limitation, publication on the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media
98 account of the county clerk.
99 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the
100 election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary, presidential preference primary,
101 general, special and district elections in all cities and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of
102 this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations which provide standards for
103 certain reports which are required to be filed by a county or city clerk.
104 [Section 16 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to require any deputy or
105 employee of the Office of the Secretary of State whose duties relate to elections to attend the
106 training course provided by the Secretary of State concerning elections procedures. (NRS
107 293.2504)]
108 Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting the
109 received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the board to complete
110 the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day following the election. (NRS
111 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the
112 mail ballot central counting board to begin counting the received mail ballots 15 days before
113 the day of the election; and (2) require the mail ballot central counting board to process each
114 mail ballot [on] within 24 hours after receipt of the [day that the] mail ballot unless a
115 waiver is [received. Section] granted by the Secretary of State. Sections 19 and 60 of this
116 bill [requires] require the Secretary of State, rather than a county or city clerk, to establish
117 procedures for minimum requirements for the processing and counting of mail ballots.
118 (NRS [293.269925)] 293.269925, 293C.26325)
119 Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain persons in the
120 county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect not to receive such a mail
121 ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk which must be received by the county
Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 6
122 clerk not later than 60 days before the day of the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of
123 this bill authorizes a voter who elects not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a
124 mail ballot for the election if he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to
125 the county clerk a written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk. Sections 18 and
126 59.5 of this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to each registered voter
127 who resides within the State from not later than 20 days before the election to instead on
128 or after the fifth Monday before the election but not later than the fourth Monday
129 before the election.
130 Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the elector is
131 eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by computer using the system
132 established by the Secretary of State before the elector appears at a polling place to vote in
133 person. Existing law further requires an elector who submits an application to register to vote
134 in such a manner less than 14 days before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837,
135 293.671) Section 41 of this bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application
136 less than 18 days before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to
137 prepare and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or her
138 voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before the election.
139 (NRS 293.269911)
140 Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic roster, to
141 complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and not later than 5 p.m.
142 on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance to ensure
143 its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this bill prohibits such a test from being
144 completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2 weeks, before the first day of the period for early
145 voting by personal appearance. Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period
146 provided in existing law for a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical
147 recording device which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating
148 equipment and programs. (NRS 293B.150)
149 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for purposes of
150 certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to challenge the right of a
151 person to vote and provide that the term does not include knowledge obtained from a third
152 party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
153 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
154 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
155 audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the completion of logic and
156 accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170)
157 Section 56 of this bill provides that such materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of
158 an election accuracy audit.
159 Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain provisions
160 relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election includes, in any general
161 election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns for a candidate for United States
162 Senator or Representative in Congress. (NRS 293.403)
163 Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of a
164 person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration of certain
165 electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section 34 of this bill
166 requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of a person if the county
167 clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree of consanguinity of the person,
168 a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if
169 the registration or preregistration of an elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the
170 county clerk later determines that the registration or preregistration should not have been
171 cancelled, the county clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
172 Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain elections
173 that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential preference primary election or
174 general election is, if the person is registering by appearing in person at the office of the
175 county clerk or certain county facilities, the fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election,
176 presidential preference primary election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this
177 bill instead provides that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the
178 first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
179 revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and special city
180 election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general city election. Section 37
Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 7
181 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is received not later than 5 days after
182 the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to accept the application if it is obtained from the
183 Department of Motor Vehicles and is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early
184 voting by personal appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
185 personal appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
186 Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on the same
187 day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or special election by any
188 method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the recall or special election. (NRS
189 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last day to register to vote for such a recall or
190 special election: (1) by mail is the second Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2)
191 by appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is,
192 depending on if there is a period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the
193 day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third
194 Saturday preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system
195 established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day of the
196 recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such registration for such
197 recall and special city elections.
198 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll from
199 certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain exceptions, remaining
200 inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with the conduct of an election; and (2)
201 in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking to a voter on the subject of marking the
202 voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
203 Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain local
204 governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or mechanical recording
205 device which is currently used in any election of this State is provisional unless such an entity:
206 (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to transition to a new mechanical voting system or
207 mechanical recording device which is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a
208 contract for the purchase, lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical
209 recording device.
210 Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register, record and
211 count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections of any kind held in
212 this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead provides that ballots or votes: (1)
213 may be cast, registered and recorded using a mechanical voting system; and (2) must be
214 counted using a mechanical voting system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of
215 this bill make conforming changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for
216 counting votes and clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is
217 authorized but not required.
218 Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
219 Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election which is set
220 forth in existing law as the first Tuesday in February of each presidential election year. (NRS
221 298.650)

25 293.1276 1. [Within 4] Except as otherwise provided by NRS 295.056,
26 within 9 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the submission of a
27 petition containing signatures which are required to be verified pursuant to NRS
28 293.128, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035 or 306.110, and within [2] 7 days, excluding
29 Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the submission of a petition containing
30 signatures which are required to be verified pursuant to NRS 293.172 or 293.200,
31 the county clerk shall determine the total number of signatures affixed to the
32 documents and, in the case of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a
33 constitutional amendment or statewide measure, shall tally the number of signatures
34 for each petition district contained fully or partially within the county and forward
35 that information to the Secretary of State.
36 2. If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures filed with
37 all the county clerks is less than 100 percent of the required number of registered
38 voters, the Secretary of State shall so notify the person who submitted the petition
39 and the county clerks and no further action may be taken in regard to the petition. If
40 the petition is a petition to recall a county, district or municipal officer, the
41 Secretary of State shall also notify the officer with whom the petition is to be filed.
42 3. After the petition is submitted to the county clerk, it must not be handled
43 by any other person except by an employee of the county clerk’s office until it is
44 filed with the Secretary of State.
45 4. The Secretary of State may adopt regulations establishing procedures to
46 carry out the provisions of this section.
47 Sec. 7. NRS 293.1277 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 293.1277 1. If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of
49 signatures submitted to all the county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number
50 of registered voters needed to declare the petition sufficient, the Secretary of State
51 shall immediately so notify the county clerks. After the notification, each of the
52 county clerks shall determine the number of registered voters who have signed the
53 documents submitted in the county clerk’s county and, in the case of a petition for
Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 10
1 initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide
2 measure, shall tally the number of signatures for each petition district contained or
3 fully contained within the county clerk’s county. This determination must be
4 completed within [9] 14 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the
5 notification pursuant to this subsection regarding a petition containing signatures
6 which are required to be verified pursuant to NRS 293.128, 295.056, 298.109 or
7 306.110, within [20] 25 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the
8 notification pursuant to this subsection regarding a petition containing signatures
9 which are required to be verified pursuant to NRS 306.035, and within [3] 8 days,
10 excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the notification pursuant to this
11 subsection regarding a petition containing signatures which are required to be
12 verified pursuant to NRS 293.172 or 293.200. For the purpose of verification
13 pursuant to this section, the county clerk shall not include in his or her tally of total
14 signatures any signature included in the incorrect petition district.
15 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if more than 500
16 names have been signed on the documents submitted to a county clerk, the county
17 clerk shall examine the signatures by sampling them at random for verification. The
18 random sample of signatures to be verified must be drawn in such a manner that
19 every signature which has been submitted to the county clerk is given an equal
20 opportunity to be included in the sample. The sample must include an examination
21 of:
22 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), at least 500 or 5 percent of
23 the signatures, whichever is greater.
24 (b) If the petition is for the recall of a public officer who holds a statewide
25 office, at least 25 percent of the signatures.
26  If documents were submitted to the county clerk for more than one petition
27 district wholly contained within that county, a separate random sample must be
28 performed for each petition district.
29 3. If a petition district comprises more than one county and the petition is for
30 an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or a statewide
31 measure, and if more than 500 names have been signed on the documents submitted
32 for that petition district, the appropriate county clerks shall examine the signatures
33 by sampling them at random for verification. The random sample of signatures to
34 be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every signature which has been
35 submitted to the county clerks within the petition district is given an equal
36 opportunity to be included in the sample. The sample must include an examination
37 of at least 500 or 5 percent of the signatures presented in the petition district,
38 whichever is greater. The Secretary of State shall determine the number of
39 signatures that must be verified by each county clerk within the petition district.
40 4. If a petition is for the recall of a public officer who does not hold a
41 statewide office, each county clerk:
42 (a) Shall not examine the signatures by sampling them at random for
43 verification;
44 (b) Shall examine for verification every signature on the documents submitted
45 to the county clerk; and
46 (c) When determining the total number of valid signatures on the documents,
47 shall remove each name of a registered voter who submitted a request to have his or
48 her name removed from the petition pursuant to NRS 306.015.
49 5. In determining from the records of registration the number of registered
50 voters who signed the documents, the county clerk may use the signatures
51 contained in the file of applications to register to vote. If the county clerk uses that
52 file, the county clerk shall ensure that every application in the file is examined,
53 including any application in his or her possession which may not yet be entered into
Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 11
1 the county clerk’s records. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
2 clerk shall rely only on the appearance of the signature and the address and date
3 included with each signature in making his or her determination.
4 6. If:
5 (a) A person registers to vote using the system established by the Secretary of
6 State pursuant to NRS 293.671;
7 (b) A person registers to vote pursuant to NRS 293D.230 and signs his or her
8 application to register to vote using a digital signature or an electronic signature; or
9 (c) A person is registered to vote by an automatic voter registration agency,
10  the county clerk may rely on such other indicia as prescribed by the Secretary of
11 State in making his or her determination.
12 7. [The county clerk shall allow 2 business days for a person to cure any
13 defect in a signature on the petition.
14 8.] In the case of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a
15 constitutional amendment or statewide measure, when the county clerk is
16 determining the number of registered voters who signed the documents from each
17 petition district contained fully or partially within the county clerk’s county, he or
18 she must use the statewide voter registration list available pursuant to NRS
19 293.675.
20 8. [9.] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 10, [11,] upon completing
21 the examination, the county clerk shall immediately attach to the documents a
22 certificate properly dated, showing the result of the examination, including the tally
23 of signatures by petition district, if required, and transmit the documents with the
24 certificate to the Secretary of State. In the case of a petition for initiative or
25 referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide measure, if a
26 petition district comprises more than one county, the appropriate county clerks shall
27 comply with the regulations adopted by the Secretary of State pursuant to this
28 section to complete the certificate. A copy of this certificate must be filed in the
29 clerk’s office. When the county clerk transmits the certificate to the Secretary of
30 State, the county clerk shall notify the Secretary of State of the number of requests
31 to remove a name received by the county clerk pursuant to NRS 295.055 or
32 pursuant to NRS 306.015 for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a
33 statewide office, if applicable.
34 9. [10.] A person who submits a petition to the county clerk which is required
35 to be verified pursuant to NRS 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109,
36 306.035 or 306.110 must be allowed to witness the verification of the signatures. A
37 public officer who is the subject of a recall petition must also be allowed to witness
38 the verification of the signatures on the petition.
39 10. [11.] For any petition containing signatures which are required to be
40 verified pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.200, 306.035 or 306.110 for any
41 county, district or municipal office within one county, the county clerk shall not
42 transmit to the Secretary of State the documents containing the signatures of the
43 registered voters.

45 procedures for carrying out the provisions of this section.

9 candidacy pursuant to subsection 2 must be the street address of the residence
10 where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in accordance
11 with NRS 281.050, if one has been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not
12 be accepted for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following provisions
13 of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of subsection 4:
14 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post office box
15 unless a street address has not been assigned to his or her residence; and

25 stating that the candidate is unable to present to the filing officer the proof of

27 the candidate’s residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
28 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency required by
29 subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing officer:
30 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a governmental
31 agency that contains a photograph of the candidate; and

39 provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or 4. Such a copy:

48 address, service must be made by personally delivering to and leaving with the
49 filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The filing officer shall immediately
50 send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies to the candidate at the
51 specified address, unless the candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer
52 a different address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail the
53 copy to the last address so designated.

1 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that a candidate
2 has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her civil rights restored, the
3 filing officer:
4 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the candidate has been
5 convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the candidate has had his or her civil rights
6 restored; and
7 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from such
8 investigation to the Attorney General, if the filing officer is the Secretary of State,
9 or to the district attorney, if the filing officer is a person other than the Secretary of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the Secretary of State to establish a system of approved electronic
2 transmission through which voters may register to vote and apply for and cast a ballot. (NRS
3 293D.200) Existing law further sets forth provisions governing voting by persons who are
4 detained in a county or city jail. (NRS 293.269971, 293.269973, 293.269975) Section 2 of this

Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 4
5 bill requires the Secretary of State to allow: (1) an elector who is detained in a county or city
6 jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission established for covered voters who
7 are overseas or in the military to register to vote; and (2) a registered voter who is detained in
8 a county or city jail to use the system of approved electronic transmission to apply for and cast
9 a ballot in every election where the system of approved electronic transmission is available to
10 a covered voter who is overseas or in the military. Section 15 of this bill requires the Secretary
11 of State to prescribe the procedures to be followed and the requirements of the use of the
12 system of approved electronic transmission by electors and voters who are detained in a
13 county or city jail. Section 21 of this bill requires the report submitted to the Secretary of State
14 by a person who administers a county or city jail concerning elections conducted in such jails
15 to include an explanation of the process the jail used to comply with the provisions of section
16 2. (NRS 293.269975)]
17 Section 3 of this bill requires, with limited exception, a county or city clerk to respond
18 within 2 working days after receiving any request from the Secretary of State for information
19 or data relating to [an] the current election [.] cycle.
20 Section 4 of this bill provides that if an active registered voter moves to another county
21 and registers to vote therein, which may include, without limitation, an application to register
22 to vote which is transmitted to a county clerk from an automatic voter registration agency, it
23 shall be deemed that the voter is updating his or her voter registration rather than registering to
24 vote and, with certain exceptions, the voter must not be required to cast a provisional ballot on
25 the basis of such an update.
26 Existing law sets forth certain procedures governing the use of provisional ballots by
27 registered voters who update their voter registration information after the close of registration
28 for an election and by electors who register to vote in person or by computer during certain
29 periods of time leading up to and during an election. Specifically, existing law: (1) with
30 certain exceptions, requires an elector who is deemed conditionally registered to vote under
31 such circumstances to cast his or her vote by a provisional ballot; and (2) authorizes a county
32 or city clerk, under certain circumstances, to require a registered voter who updates his or her
33 voter registration to cast a provisional ballot in an election. (NRS 293.5772-293.5887)
34 Sections 5, 23, 26, 32 and 38-47 of this bill rename ballots cast under such circumstances to
35 be “conditional ballots.”
36 Existing law requires certain petitions to be submitted to a county clerk for verification of
37 the signatures on the petition and sets forth certain deadlines for such submission. (NRS
38 293.128, 293.172, 293.200, 295.056, 298.109, 306.035, 306.110) Section 65 of this bill
39 [prohibits] authorizes a county clerk, under certain circumstances, to delay beginning
40 verification for petitions for referendum and certain initiatives . [from being submitted to a
41 county clerk earlier than the 13th day following the primary or general election, as
42 appropriate.] (NRS 295.056) Existing law requires, after the submission of certain petitions
43 containing signatures which are required to be verified, the county clerk to determine the
44 number of signatures affixed to the documents and forward that information to the Secretary
45 of State. (NRS 293.1276) Section 6 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to
46 make such a determination: (1) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan
47 office of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot,
48 from 2 working days to 7 working days; and (2) for any other petition which is required to be
49 submitted for such purposes, from 4 working days to 9 working days.
50 If the Secretary of State finds that the total number of signatures submitted to all the
51 county clerks is 100 percent or more of the number of registered voters needed to declare the
52 petition sufficient, existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to immediately notify the
53 county clerks; and (2) each of the county clerks, after the receipt of such notification, to
54 determine the number of registered voters who have signed the document. (NRS 293.1277)
55 Section 7 of this bill increases the time provided to a county clerk to make such a
56 determination: (1) for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a statewide office, from
57 20 working days to 25 working days; (2) for a petition to place the name of a candidate for
58 partisan office of a minor political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the
59 ballot, from 3 working days to 8 working days; and (3) for any other petition which is required
60 to be submitted for such purposes, from 9 working days to 14 working days. Sections 8 and
61 11 of this bill require a petition to place the name of a candidate for partisan office of a minor
62 political party or an independent candidate for partisan office on the ballot be submitted to the

Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 5
63 county clerk for verification or filing, respectively, not later than 25 working days, rather
64 than 10 working days, before the last day to file the petition.
65 Existing law [provides] requires that the [period for filing a declaration] petition of
66 candidacy [: (1) for judicial candidates begins on the first Monday in January of the year in
67 which the election is to be held and ends the second Friday after the first Monday in January;
68 and (2) for all nonjudicial candidates begins on] for an independent candidate for partisan
69 office be filed not earlier than the first Monday in March of the year in which the election is
70 to be held and [ends] not later than the [second] third Friday [after the first Monday] in
71 [March. (NRS 293.177, 293C.145, 293C.175) Sections 9-11, 58 and 59 of this bill instead
72 provide that the period for filing a declaration of candidacy for both judicial and nonjudicial
73 candidates begins on the first Monday in February of the year in which the election is to be
74 held and ends not later than 5 p.m. on the second Friday after the first Monday in February.
75 Section 9 similarly revises the dates by which a minor political party is required by existing
76 law to file a list of its candidates for partisan office. (NRS 293.1725)] June. (NRS 293.200)
77 Section 11 [further] instead provides that a petition of candidacy for an independent
78 candidate for partisan office must not be filed earlier than the [first] second Monday [in
79 February rather] after the primary election and not later than the [first Monday in March.]
80 third Friday after the primary election. Section 11 additionally: (1) requires such a
81 petition to be submitted to the county clerk for verification during this period of time;
82 and (2) provides that if such a petition is submitted in a timely manner but the Secretary
83 of State receives certificates from the county clerks showing the petition has met certain
84 requirements after this deadline, the petition is deemed to be timely filed.
85 Existing law requires a county clerk to publish certain information concerning elections
86 in a newspaper of general circulation. (NRS 293.203, 293.253, 293.3073, 293.3576, 293.391,
87 293.464, 298.670) Sections 12, 25, 27, 28, 31 and 68 of this bill instead require the county
88 clerk to publish such notices in such a manner as the county clerk deems proper, which may
89 include, without limitation, publication in a newspaper of general circulation, on the Internet
90 website of the county clerk or on the social media account of the county clerk.
91 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to cause to be published in a
92 newspaper of general circulation, on three separate occasions, in each county of the State,
93 together with any explanatory matter to be placed on the ballot, the entire text of a proposed
94 amendment to the Nevada Constitution which is proposed by an initiative petition. (Nev. Art.
95 19, § 2; NRS 293.253) Section 17 of this bill authorizes a county clerk to also publish such
96 materials in any other manner as the county clerk deems proper which may include, without
97 limitation, publication on the Internet website of the county clerk or on the social media
98 account of the county clerk.
99 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations, not inconsistent with the
100 election laws of this State, for the conduct of primary, presidential preference primary,
101 general, special and district elections in all cities and counties. (NRS 293.247) Section 14 of
102 this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to adopt regulations which provide standards for
103 certain reports which are required to be filed by a county or city clerk.
104 [Section 16 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to require any deputy or
105 employee of the Office of the Secretary of State whose duties relate to elections to attend the
106 training course provided by the Secretary of State concerning elections procedures. (NRS
107 293.2504)]
108 Existing law authorizes a mail ballot central counting board to begin counting the
109 received mail ballots 15 days before the day of the election and requires the board to complete
110 the count of all mail ballots on or before the seventh day following the election. (NRS
111 293.269931, 293C.26331) Sections 20 and 61 of this bill: (1) require, instead of authorize, the
112 mail ballot central counting board to begin counting the received mail ballots 15 days before
113 the day of the election; and (2) require the mail ballot central counting board to process each
114 mail ballot [on] within 24 hours after receipt of the [day that the] mail ballot unless a
115 waiver is [received. Section] granted by the Secretary of State. Sections 19 and 60 of this
116 bill [requires] require the Secretary of State, rather than a county or city clerk, to establish
117 procedures for minimum requirements for the processing and counting of mail ballots.
118 (NRS [293.269925)] 293.269925, 293C.26325)
119 Existing law requires a county clerk to: (1) prepare and distribute to certain persons in the
120 county a mail ballot for every election; and (2) allow a voter to elect not to receive such a mail
121 ballot by submitting a written notice to the county clerk which must be received by the county

Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 6
122 clerk not later than 60 days before the day of the election. (NRS 293.269911) Section 18 of
123 this bill authorizes a voter who elects not to receive a mail ballot to later elect to receive a
124 mail ballot for the election if he or she, not later than 14 days before the election, submits to
125 the county clerk a written notice in the form prescribed by the county clerk. Sections 18 and
126 59.5 of this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to each registered voter
127 who resides within the State from not later than 20 days before the election to instead on
128 or after the fifth Monday before the election but not later than the fourth Monday
129 before the election.
130 Existing law authorizes an elector to vote in the county or city in which the elector is
131 eligible to vote by submitting an application to register to vote by computer using the system
132 established by the Secretary of State before the elector appears at a polling place to vote in
133 person. Existing law further requires an elector who submits an application to register to vote
134 in such a manner less than 14 days before the election to vote in person. (NRS 293.5837,
135 293.671) Section 41 of this bill instead requires an elector who submits such an application
136 less than 18 days before the election to vote in person. Section 18 requires a county clerk to
137 prepare and distribute a mail ballot to each person who registers to vote or updates his or her
138 voter registration information not later than 18 days, rather than 14 days, before the election.
139 (NRS 293.269911)
140 Existing law requires a county clerk, if the county clerk uses an electronic roster, to
141 complete a test of the electronic roster not earlier than 2 weeks before and not later than 5 p.m.
142 on the day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance to ensure
143 its functionality. (NRS 293.275) Section 22 of this bill prohibits such a test from being
144 completed earlier than 6 weeks, instead of 2 weeks, before the first day of the period for early
145 voting by personal appearance. Section 55 of this bill similarly revises the time period
146 provided in existing law for a county or city clerk to perform certain tests on a mechanical
147 recording device which directly records votes electronically and any automatic tabulating
148 equipment and programs. (NRS 293B.150)
149 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill define the term “personal knowledge” for purposes of
150 certain provisions of existing law which authorize certain persons to challenge the right of a
151 person to vote and provide that the term does not include knowledge obtained from a third
152 party. (NRS 293.303, 293.535)
153 Existing law requires each county clerk to conduct a risk-limiting audit of the results of
154 an election. (NRS 293.394) Section 29 of this bill renames such audits to “election accuracy
155 audits.” Existing law provides that certain materials used in the completion of logic and
156 accuracy tests must be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. (NRS 293B.170)
157 Section 56 of this bill provides that such materials are subject to inspection for the purposes of
158 an election accuracy audit.
159 Section 30 of this bill provides that the term “canvass” as used in certain provisions
160 relating to recounts demanded by a candidate defeated at an election includes, in any general
161 election, the canvass by the Supreme Court of the returns for a candidate for United States
162 Senator or Representative in Congress. (NRS 293.403)
163 Existing law requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of a
164 person under certain circumstances and authorizes or requires the reregistration of certain
165 electors whose registration is cancelled. (NRS 293.540, 293.543) Section 34 of this bill
166 requires a county clerk to cancel the preregistration or registration of a person if the county
167 clerk receives, from a person who is within the second degree of consanguinity of the person,
168 a sworn affidavit which indicates the death of the person. Section 35 of this bill requires, if
169 the registration or preregistration of an elector is cancelled under such circumstances and the
170 county clerk later determines that the registration or preregistration should not have been
171 cancelled, the county clerk to reregister or repreregister the elector.
172 Existing law provides that the last day for a person to register to vote for certain elections
173 that are held on the same day as a primary election, presidential preference primary election or
174 general election is, if the person is registering by appearing in person at the office of the
175 county clerk or certain county facilities, the fourth Tuesday preceding the primary election,
176 presidential preference primary election or general election. (NRS 293.560) Section 36 of this
177 bill instead provides that the last day to register to vote in such a manner is the day before the
178 first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance. Section 62 of this bill similarly
179 revises such deadlines for registration for a primary city, general city, recall and special city
180 election if there is a period for early voting for the primary or general city election. Section 37

Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 7
181 of this bill requires, if an application to register to vote is received not later than 5 days after
182 the appropriate deadline, a county clerk to accept the application if it is obtained from the
183 Department of Motor Vehicles and is completed by, depending on if there is a period for early
184 voting by personal appearance, the day before the first day of the period for early voting by
185 personal appearance or the last day to register to vote by mail. (NRS 293.5727)
186 Existing law further provides that if a recall or special election is not held on the same
187 day as certain elections, the last day to register to vote for the recall or special election by any
188 method of registration is the third Saturday preceding the recall or special election. (NRS
189 293.560) Section 36 instead provides that the last day to register to vote for such a recall or
190 special election: (1) by mail is the second Tuesday preceding the recall or special election; (2)
191 by appearing in person at the office of the county clerk or certain county facilities is,
192 depending on if there is a period for early voting for the recall or special election, either the
193 day before the first day of the period for early voting by personal appearance or the third
194 Saturday preceding the recall or special election; and (3) by computer using the system
195 established on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State is the day of the
196 recall or special election. Section 62 similarly revises deadlines for such registration for such
197 recall and special city elections.
198 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill exempt a person who is conducting an exit poll from
199 certain provisions of law which prohibit a person from: (1) with certain exceptions, remaining
200 inside or outside of any polling place so as to interfere with the conduct of an election; and (2)
201 in certain locations, soliciting a vote or speaking to a voter on the subject of marking the
202 voter’s ballots. (NRS 293.730, 293.740)
203 Section 50 of this bill provides that the termination of a contract by certain local
204 governing bodies for the lease or use of a mechanical voting system or mechanical recording
205 device which is currently used in any election of this State is provisional unless such an entity:
206 (1) submits to the Secretary of State a plan to transition to a new mechanical voting system or
207 mechanical recording device which is approved by the Secretary of State; and (2) signs a
208 contract for the purchase, lease or use of the new mechanical voting system or mechanical
209 recording device.
210 Existing law authorizes mechanical voting systems to be used to cast, register, record and
211 count ballots or votes at all statewide, county, city and district elections of any kind held in
212 this State. (NRS 293B.050) Section 51 of this bill instead provides that ballots or votes: (1)
213 may be cast, registered and recorded using a mechanical voting system; and (2) must be
214 counted using a mechanical voting system. Sections 13, 52-54, 57, 63, 64, 66 and 69-80 of
215 this bill make conforming changes to require the use of a mechanical voting system for
216 counting votes and clarify that the use of a mechanical voting system for casting ballots is
217 authorized but not required.
218 Section 67 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of State, with the approval of the
219 Legislative Commission, to adjust the date of the presidential primary election which is set

Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 10
1 initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide
2 measure, shall tally the number of signatures for each petition district contained or
3 fully contained within the county clerk’s county. This determination must be
4 completed within [9] 14 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the

23 the signatures, whichever is greater.

30 an initiative or referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or a statewide
31 measure, and if more than 500 names have been signed on the documents submitted
32 for that petition district, the appropriate county clerks shall examine the signatures
33 by sampling them at random for verification. The random sample of signatures to
34 be verified must be drawn in such a manner that every signature which has been
35 submitted to the county clerks within the petition district is given an equal
36 opportunity to be included in the sample. The sample must include an examination

38 whichever is greater. The Secretary of State shall determine the number of
39 signatures that must be verified by each county clerk within the petition district.

48 her name removed from the petition pursuant to NRS 306.015.

52 file, the county clerk shall ensure that every application in the file is examined,
53 including any application in his or her possession which may not yet be entered into

Assembly Amendment No. 909 to Assembly Bill No. 534 Page 11

6 State pursuant to NRS 293.671;

11 State in making his or her determination.
12 7. [The county clerk shall allow 2 business days for a person to cure any
13 defect in a signature on the petition.
14 8.] In the case of a petition for initiative or referendum proposing a

18 she must use the statewide voter registration list available pursuant to NRS
19 293.675.

21 the examination, the county clerk shall immediately attach to the documents a
22 certificate properly dated, showing the result of the examination, including the tally
23 of signatures by petition district, if required, and transmit the documents with the
24 certificate to the Secretary of State. In the case of a petition for initiative or
25 referendum proposing a constitutional amendment or statewide measure, if a
26 petition district comprises more than one county, the appropriate county clerks shall
27 comply with the regulations adopted by the Secretary of State pursuant to this
28 section to complete the certificate. A copy of this certificate must be filed in the
29 clerk’s office. When the county clerk transmits the certificate to the Secretary of
30 State, the county clerk shall notify the Secretary of State of the number of requests
31 to remove a name received by the county clerk pursuant to NRS 295.055 or
32 pursuant to NRS 306.015 for a petition to recall a public officer who holds a

37 public officer who is the subject of a recall petition must also be allowed to witness
38 the verification of the signatures on the petition.
39 10. [11.] For any petition containing signatures which are required to be
40 verified pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.200, 306.035 or 306.110 for any
41 county, district or municipal office within one county, the county clerk shall not
