5 Officer to order the temporary suspension of such requirements and any regulation
6 relating to the sale of eggs in this State during an ongoing event that negatively
7 impacts the national supply chain for egg products or shell eggs which may not
8 exceed 120 consecutive days per suspension. Section 1 additionally: (1) prohibits
9 the State Quarantine Officer from ordering more than two temporary suspensions in
10 1 calendar year; and (2) requires the State Quarantine Officer to provide notice to
11 the public when the order for the temporary suspension will be released. Section 1
12 further authorizes the State Quarantine Officer to temporarily: (1) authorize the sale
13 of grade B eggs; (2) prohibit certain governmental entities from purchasing eggs;
14 and (3) authorize a farm owner or operator of a small egg flock to produce, sell or
15 transport eggs to a retailer.
16 Section 8 of this bill authorizes the State Quarantine Officer to adopt
17 regulations governing the circumstances in which a temporary suspension will be
