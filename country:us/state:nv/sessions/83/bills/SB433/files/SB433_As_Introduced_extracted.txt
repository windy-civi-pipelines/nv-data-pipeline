Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 16 of this bill: (1) establishes certain requirements for the structural
2 inspection of the primary load-bearing system of a residential building in a
3 common-interest community that meets certain criteria relating to height and
4 materials and techniques of construction, defined as a “covered building” in section
5 5 of this bill; and (2) imposes certain duties on a structural inspector who performs
6 such a structural inspection. Section 16 also: (1) prohibits a certificate of
7 occupancy to be issued for a covered building until a structural inspector confirms
8 that the primary-load bearing system of the building conforms to approved
9 construction plans; (2) authorizes the office of a city or county building official to
10 recover any additional cost incurred as a result of such structural inspections; and
11 (3) requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt ordinances to
12 carry out these provisions.
13 Section 17 of this bill sets forth certain periods by which an owner of a covered
14 building is required to retain a structural inspector to perform certain structural
15 inspections of the building components of the primary load-bearing system of a
16 covered building. Section 57 of this bill requires the owner of a covered building to
17 retain a structural inspector to perform such a structural inspection of the building
18 components of the primary load-bearing system of a covered building for which a
19 certificate of occupancy was issued before the date on which certain provisions of
20 this bill become effective.
21 Section 18 of this bill provides that a structural inspection may be performed in
22 conjunction with any other required inspection. Section 19 of this bill requires a
23 structural inspector, before undertaking a structural inspection of a covered
24 building, to review the written report from the most recent structural inspection of
25 the covered building. Sections 20, 31 and 32 of this bill require a structural
26 inspector who has performed a structural inspection to issue a written report and
27 sets forth certain requirements for that report, including, without limitation,
28 requiring the report to be: (1) filed with, or provided or made available to, certain
29 persons; and (2) included within a public offering statement of a common-interest
30 community and a resale package. Section 21 of this bill imposes certain duties on
31 the owner of a covered building who receives a written report of a structural
32 inspection. Section 22 of this bill requires the Commission for Common-Interest
33 Communities and Condominium Hotels to adopt regulations relating to structural
34 inspections. Sections 3-6, 8-13 and 23 of this bill define certain words and terms
35 for the purposes of such inspections.
36 Sections 15 and 26 of this bill: (1) authorize the executive board of an
37 association to make assessments for certain corrective repairs; and (2) require an
38 association to establish reserves for corrective repairs. Section 27 of this bill
39 requires the study of reserves of an association to include an estimate of the costs
40 associated with implementing any corrective repairs deemed necessary pursuant to
41 a written report of a structural inspector.
42 Section 24 of this bill revises certain provisions for the applicability to certain
43 planned communities of words and terms defined in sections 2-14 of this bill and
44 provisions governing structural inspections in sections 15-22 of this bill.
45 Existing law requires a declarant of a common-interest community to deliver to
46 an association certain property of the units’ owners and of the association held or
47 controlled by the declarant. (NRS 116.31038) Section 25 of this bill eliminates the
48 requirement that the declarant deliver a copy of any plans and specifications used in
49 the construction of the improvements in the common-interest community which
50 were completed within 2 years before the declaration was recorded. Section 25
51 requires the declarant to deliver: (1) a copy of any plans and specifications used in
52 the construction of the improvements to common elements in the common-interest
53 community; and (2) for any covered building, a manual of preventive maintenance
54 relating to the common elements with a statement of the funds necessary to perform
-
*SB433*
– 3 –
55 the preventive maintenance in accordance with the schedule provided in the
56 manual.
57 Existing law: (1) prohibits certain persons within a common-interest
58 community from committing certain acts against another person within that same
59 common-interest community; and (2) provides that committing any such act is a
60 misdemeanor. (NRS 116.31184) Section 30 of this bill includes bullying and cyber-
61 bullying among the prohibited acts. Sections 2 and 7 of this bill define the terms
62 “bullying” and “cyber-bullying” for the purposes of such prohibitions. Section 14
63 of this bill revises the definition of the term “violation” to include violations of
64 such new prohibitions for the purposes of authorizing investigations and remedial
65 and disciplinary action, and section 59 of this bill repeals the existing definition of
66 the term “violation.” Sections 33, 38-40 and 44 of this bill make conforming
67 changes to eliminate references to the repealed definition of the term “violation.”
68 Existing law sets forth procedures by which: (1) a person who is aggrieved by
69 an alleged violation may file a written affidavit with the Real Estate Division of the
70 Department of Business and Industry; (2) the Division is required, except under
71 certain circumstances, to refer the affidavit to the Ombudsman for Owners in
72 Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels for guidance and a
73 report; and (3) the Division investigates the alleged violation, files a formal
74 complaint with the Commission and schedules a hearing. (NRS 116.760, 116.765)
75 Section 41 of this bill requires the Division to refer the affidavit to the Ombudsman
76 if the Division determines that: (1) the allegations in the affidavit are not vexatious,
77 misleading, retaliatory, frivolous, false or fraudulent; and (2) the alleged violation,
78 if assumed to be true, would constitute a violation. Section 42 of this bill requires
79 the Administrator of the Division to file a formal complaint with the Commission
80 and schedule a hearing if, after receiving a report from the Ombudsman and
81 investigating the alleged violation, the Division reasonably believes that: (1) the
82 allegations in the affidavit are supported by probable cause; (2) the admissible
83 evidence is sufficient to support sanctions against the respondent by a
84 preponderance of the evidence; and (3) a decision to file a formal complaint with
85 the Commission is in the best interests of justice and associations in this State.
86 Section 43 of this bill authorizes the Commission or a hearing panel to prohibit
87 a respondent from serving on the executive board of an association for a period not
88 to exceed 10 years under certain circumstances.
89 Existing law requires the executive board of an association to provide, upon the
90 written request of a unit’s owner, a copy of certain records in electronic format at
91 no cost to the unit’s owner. (NRS 116.31175) Section 28 of this bill: (1) authorizes
92 the executive board to charge a fee to cover the actual costs of preparing a copy of
93 the records in electronic format, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10
94 pages, and 10 cents per page thereafter; (2) revises the amount an executive board
95 may charge a unit’s owner to review any books, records, contracts or other papers
96 of the association; and (3) provides that the requirement to provide a copy of
97 records to a unit’s owner does not apply to the personnel records of the employees
98 of the association, including, without limitation, information relating to the salaries
99 and benefits of the employees and other information concerning the employees.
100 Existing law: (1) prohibits an executive board, a member of an executive board,
101 a community manager or an officer, employee or agent of an association from
102 taking, or directing or encouraging another person to take, any retaliatory action
103 against a unit’s owner under certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes, in addition
104 to any other remedy provided by law, a unit’s owner to bring a separate action to
105 recover compensatory damages and attorney’s fees and costs of bringing the action.
106 (NRS 116.31183) Section 29 of this bill: (1) similarly prohibits a unit’s owner,
107 tenant of a unit’s owner or guest or invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant of a unit’s
108 owner from taking retaliatory action against an executive board, a member of an
109 executive board, a community manager or an officer, employee or agent of an
-
*SB433*
– 4 –
110 association under certain circumstances; (2) authorizes an executive board, a
111 member of an executive board, a community manager or an officer, employee or
112 agent of an association to bring an action for the same remedies; and (3) provides a
113 definition of the term “retaliatory action.”
114 Existing law authorizes the Division to establish a program for the rendering of
115 decisions on disputes relating to: (1) the interpretation, application or enforcement
116 of any covenants, conditions or restrictions applicable to residential property or any
117 bylaws, rules or regulations adopted by an association; or (2) the procedures used
118 for increasing, decreasing or imposing additional assessments upon residential
119 property. Existing law also provides that a civil action based upon a claim relating
120 to such a dispute may not be commenced in any court in this State unless the action
121 has been submitted to mediation or, if the parties agree, has been referred to the
122 program of the Division for the rendering of decisions on such disputes. (NRS
123 38.300-38.360) Sections 34-37 and 45-54 of this bill: (1) eliminate the authority of
124 the Division to establish a program for the rendering of decisions on such disputes;
125 (2) provide for such disputes to be submitted to arbitration as well as mediation;
126 and (3) delete references to the eliminated program of the Division.
127 Section 55 of this bill revises the definition of the term “constructional defect”
128 for the purposes of actions for constructional defects. Section 56 of this bill
129 authorizes a claimant in an action for constructional defects to recover any
130 reasonable attorney’s fees sufficient to place the claimant in as good a position as
131 the claimant would have been if the constructional defect did not exist. Section 58
132 of this bill provides that the provisions amended in sections 55 and 56 apply to
133 actions for constructional defects commenced before, on or after the effective date
134 of those sections.

26 community, or if any other common expense is caused by the willful
27 misconduct or gross negligence of any unit’s owner, tenant or
28 invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association may assess that
29 expense exclusively against his or her unit, even if the association
30 maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common
31 expense, unless the damage or other common expense is caused by a

26 providing any document or other item pursuant to this section, an
27 association, or entity related to or acting on behalf of an association,
28 shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized agent of a unit’s
29 owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
30 security interest on a unit, any fee:
31 (a) Not authorized in this section; or
32 (b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this
33 section.
34 9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement
35 of demand furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in
36 which the statement of demand is effective but before the
37 consummation of a resale for which a resale package was furnished
38 pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a replacement
39 statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
40 demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand
41 receives a replacement statement of demand, the person may rely
42 upon the accuracy of the information set forth in the statement of
43 demand provided by the association for the resale. Payment of the
44 amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full payment

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 16 of this bill: (1) establishes certain requirements for the structural
2 inspection of the primary load-bearing system of a residential building in a
3 common-interest community that meets certain criteria relating to height and
4 materials and techniques of construction, defined as a “covered building” in section
5 5 of this bill; and (2) imposes certain duties on a structural inspector who performs
6 such a structural inspection. Section 16 also: (1) prohibits a certificate of
7 occupancy to be issued for a covered building until a structural inspector confirms
8 that the primary-load bearing system of the building conforms to approved
9 construction plans; (2) authorizes the office of a city or county building official to
10 recover any additional cost incurred as a result of such structural inspections; and
11 (3) requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt ordinances to
12 carry out these provisions.
13 Section 17 of this bill sets forth certain periods by which an owner of a covered
14 building is required to retain a structural inspector to perform certain structural
15 inspections of the building components of the primary load-bearing system of a
16 covered building. Section 57 of this bill requires the owner of a covered building to
17 retain a structural inspector to perform such a structural inspection of the building
18 components of the primary load-bearing system of a covered building for which a
19 certificate of occupancy was issued before the date on which certain provisions of
20 this bill become effective.
21 Section 18 of this bill provides that a structural inspection may be performed in
22 conjunction with any other required inspection. Section 19 of this bill requires a
23 structural inspector, before undertaking a structural inspection of a covered
24 building, to review the written report from the most recent structural inspection of
25 the covered building. Sections 20, 31 and 32 of this bill require a structural
26 inspector who has performed a structural inspection to issue a written report and
27 sets forth certain requirements for that report, including, without limitation,
28 requiring the report to be: (1) filed with, or provided or made available to, certain
29 persons; and (2) included within a public offering statement of a common-interest
30 community and a resale package. Section 21 of this bill imposes certain duties on
31 the owner of a covered building who receives a written report of a structural
32 inspection. Section 22 of this bill requires the Commission for Common-Interest
33 Communities and Condominium Hotels to adopt regulations relating to structural
34 inspections. Sections 3-6, 8-13 and 23 of this bill define certain words and terms
35 for the purposes of such inspections.
36 Sections 15 and 26 of this bill: (1) authorize the executive board of an
37 association to make assessments for certain corrective repairs; and (2) require an
38 association to establish reserves for corrective repairs. Section 27 of this bill
39 requires the study of reserves of an association to include an estimate of the costs
40 associated with implementing any corrective repairs deemed necessary pursuant to
41 a written report of a structural inspector.
42 Section 24 of this bill revises certain provisions for the applicability to certain
43 planned communities of words and terms defined in sections 2-14 of this bill and
44 provisions governing structural inspections in sections 15-22 of this bill.
45 Existing law requires a declarant of a common-interest community to deliver to
46 an association certain property of the units’ owners and of the association held or
47 controlled by the declarant. (NRS 116.31038) Section 25 of this bill eliminates the
48 requirement that the declarant deliver a copy of any plans and specifications used in
49 the construction of the improvements in the common-interest community which
50 were completed within 2 years before the declaration was recorded. Section 25
51 requires the declarant to deliver: (1) a copy of any plans and specifications used in
52 the construction of the improvements to common elements in the common-interest
53 community; and (2) for any covered building, a manual of preventive maintenance
54 relating to the common elements with a statement of the funds necessary to perform
-
*SB433*

– 3 –
55 the preventive maintenance in accordance with the schedule provided in the
56 manual.
57 Existing law: (1) prohibits certain persons within a common-interest
58 community from committing certain acts against another person within that same
59 common-interest community; and (2) provides that committing any such act is a
60 misdemeanor. (NRS 116.31184) Section 30 of this bill includes bullying and cyber-
61 bullying among the prohibited acts. Sections 2 and 7 of this bill define the terms
62 “bullying” and “cyber-bullying” for the purposes of such prohibitions. Section 14
63 of this bill revises the definition of the term “violation” to include violations of
64 such new prohibitions for the purposes of authorizing investigations and remedial
65 and disciplinary action, and section 59 of this bill repeals the existing definition of
66 the term “violation.” Sections 33, 38-40 and 44 of this bill make conforming
67 changes to eliminate references to the repealed definition of the term “violation.”
68 Existing law sets forth procedures by which: (1) a person who is aggrieved by
69 an alleged violation may file a written affidavit with the Real Estate Division of the
70 Department of Business and Industry; (2) the Division is required, except under
71 certain circumstances, to refer the affidavit to the Ombudsman for Owners in
72 Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels for guidance and a
73 report; and (3) the Division investigates the alleged violation, files a formal
74 complaint with the Commission and schedules a hearing. (NRS 116.760, 116.765)
75 Section 41 of this bill requires the Division to refer the affidavit to the Ombudsman
76 if the Division determines that: (1) the allegations in the affidavit are not vexatious,
77 misleading, retaliatory, frivolous, false or fraudulent; and (2) the alleged violation,
78 if assumed to be true, would constitute a violation. Section 42 of this bill requires
79 the Administrator of the Division to file a formal complaint with the Commission
80 and schedule a hearing if, after receiving a report from the Ombudsman and
81 investigating the alleged violation, the Division reasonably believes that: (1) the
82 allegations in the affidavit are supported by probable cause; (2) the admissible
83 evidence is sufficient to support sanctions against the respondent by a
84 preponderance of the evidence; and (3) a decision to file a formal complaint with
85 the Commission is in the best interests of justice and associations in this State.
86 Section 43 of this bill authorizes the Commission or a hearing panel to prohibit
87 a respondent from serving on the executive board of an association for a period not
88 to exceed 10 years under certain circumstances.
89 Existing law requires the executive board of an association to provide, upon the
90 written request of a unit’s owner, a copy of certain records in electronic format at
91 no cost to the unit’s owner. (NRS 116.31175) Section 28 of this bill: (1) authorizes
92 the executive board to charge a fee to cover the actual costs of preparing a copy of
93 the records in electronic format, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10
94 pages, and 10 cents per page thereafter; (2) revises the amount an executive board
95 may charge a unit’s owner to review any books, records, contracts or other papers
96 of the association; and (3) provides that the requirement to provide a copy of
97 records to a unit’s owner does not apply to the personnel records of the employees
98 of the association, including, without limitation, information relating to the salaries
99 and benefits of the employees and other information concerning the employees.
100 Existing law: (1) prohibits an executive board, a member of an executive board,
101 a community manager or an officer, employee or agent of an association from
102 taking, or directing or encouraging another person to take, any retaliatory action
103 against a unit’s owner under certain circumstances; and (2) authorizes, in addition
104 to any other remedy provided by law, a unit’s owner to bring a separate action to
105 recover compensatory damages and attorney’s fees and costs of bringing the action.
106 (NRS 116.31183) Section 29 of this bill: (1) similarly prohibits a unit’s owner,
107 tenant of a unit’s owner or guest or invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant of a unit’s
108 owner from taking retaliatory action against an executive board, a member of an
109 executive board, a community manager or an officer, employee or agent of an
-
*SB433*

– 4 –
110 association under certain circumstances; (2) authorizes an executive board, a
111 member of an executive board, a community manager or an officer, employee or
112 agent of an association to bring an action for the same remedies; and (3) provides a
113 definition of the term “retaliatory action.”
114 Existing law authorizes the Division to establish a program for the rendering of
115 decisions on disputes relating to: (1) the interpretation, application or enforcement
116 of any covenants, conditions or restrictions applicable to residential property or any
117 bylaws, rules or regulations adopted by an association; or (2) the procedures used
118 for increasing, decreasing or imposing additional assessments upon residential
119 property. Existing law also provides that a civil action based upon a claim relating
120 to such a dispute may not be commenced in any court in this State unless the action
121 has been submitted to mediation or, if the parties agree, has been referred to the
122 program of the Division for the rendering of decisions on such disputes. (NRS
123 38.300-38.360) Sections 34-37 and 45-54 of this bill: (1) eliminate the authority of
124 the Division to establish a program for the rendering of decisions on such disputes;
125 (2) provide for such disputes to be submitted to arbitration as well as mediation;
126 and (3) delete references to the eliminated program of the Division.
127 Section 55 of this bill revises the definition of the term “constructional defect”
128 for the purposes of actions for constructional defects. Section 56 of this bill
129 authorizes a claimant in an action for constructional defects to recover any
130 reasonable attorney’s fees sufficient to place the claimant in as good a position as
131 the claimant would have been if the constructional defect did not exist. Section 58
132 of this bill provides that the provisions amended in sections 55 and 56 apply to
133 actions for constructional defects commenced before, on or after the effective date
134 of those sections.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

44 with a structural inspector chosen by the enforcing agency or
45 covered building owner and, except as otherwise provided in this
-
*SB433*

– 8 –
1 subsection, establish a schedule of structural inspections to
2 confirm that the primary load-bearing system conforms to the
3 plans submitted by the applicant for the building permit.
4 Inspections must not be required as a condition for the issuance of
5 a building permit pursuant to this subsection if the structural
6 inspector consulted by the enforcing agency determines that the
7 building which is the subject of the application for a building
8 permit is not in fact a covered building.
9 2. Structural inspections performed pursuant to a schedule
10 established pursuant to subsection 1 must be performed under the
11 direction of a structural inspector. The structural inspector may be
12 assisted by other licensed professionals who are qualified in
13 various special disciplines, including, without limitation,
14 geotechnical and civil engineering practices, as needed to perform
15 the structural inspections required by this section.
16 3. In performing a structural inspection pursuant to this
17 section, a structural inspector shall review the construction plans
18 submitted with the application for a building permit and issue a
19 written report which includes a statement whether the primary
20 load-bearing system of the covered building conforms to the
21 construction plans. If the structural inspector determines that the
22 primary load-bearing system does not conform to the construction
23 plans, the applicant for the building permit shall provide
24 additional construction plans which conform to the modification
25 to the primary load-bearing system.
26 4. The creation, repair, renovation, alteration or modification
27 of the primary load-bearing system of a covered building required
28 as a result of any inspection must be inspected by a structural
29 inspector before a certificate of occupancy may be issued for the
30 covered building.
31 5. A certificate of occupancy for a covered building must not
32 be issued until a structural inspector issues a written report which
33 includes a statement confirming that the primary load-bearing
34 system of the covered building conforms to approved construction
35 plans.
36 6. Any additional cost to an enforcing agency incurred as a
37 result of structural inspections performed pursuant to this section
38 may be recovered through a fee which:

19 (c) The costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk
20 and the costs of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage.
21 5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may

26 community, or if any other common expense is caused by the willful
27 misconduct or gross negligence of any unit’s owner, tenant or
28 invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association may assess that
29 expense exclusively against his or her unit, even if the association
30 maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common
31 expense, unless the damage or other common expense is caused by a
32 vehicle and is committed by a person who is delivering goods to, or
33 performing services for, the unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of the
