4 matters within the Lake Tahoe Basin. (NRS 277.190-277.220) The Tahoe Regional
5 Planning Compact provides for the creation of the Tahoe transportation district as a
6 special purpose district managed by a board of directors which develops and
7 implements transportation plans and programs for the Lake Tahoe Basin.
8 Existing law also establishes the State Route 159 Safety Speed Zone and
9 authorizes the Director of the Department of Transportation to set the maximum
10 speed in the Speed Zone and the Department to ensure that adequate signage and
11 notice are installed. (NRS 484B.621) Section 1 of this bill creates the Lake Tahoe
12 Basin Scenic Byway Corridor Recreation Safety Zone, consisting of any portion of
