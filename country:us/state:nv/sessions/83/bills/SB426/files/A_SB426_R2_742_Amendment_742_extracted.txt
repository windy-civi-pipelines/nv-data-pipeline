EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; creating the Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Byway
Corridor Recreation Safety Zone; authorizing certain entities to
establish certain parking restrictions and prohibitions and enter into
agreements with other governmental entities to provide parking
enforcement and collect parking fees within the Safety Zone; providing
a penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, an interstate agreement
2 between the States of California and Nevada pursuant to which the bistate Tahoe Regional
3 Planning Agency regulates environmental and land-use matters within the Lake Tahoe Basin.
4 (NRS 277.190-277.220) The Tahoe Regional Planning Compact provides for the creation of
5 the Tahoe transportation district as a special purpose district managed by a board of directors
6 which develops and implements transportation plans and programs for the Lake Tahoe Basin.
7 Existing law also establishes the State Route 159 Safety Speed Zone and authorizes: (1)
8 the Director of the Department of Transportation to set the maximum speed in the Speed
9 Zone; and (2) the Department to ensure that adequate signage and other forms of notice are
10 installed. (NRS 484B.621) Section 1 of this bill creates the Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Byway
11 Corridor Recreation Safety Zone, consisting of any portion of U.S. Highway 50, Nevada State
12 Route 28, Nevada State Route 431 and Nevada State Route 207 that is located in the Lake
13 Tahoe Region and directly connected to a recreational destination or that has otherwise been
14 designated as a scenic byway. Section 1 authorizes the Department and certain local law
15 enforcement agencies to: (1) establish certain traffic control measures and parking restrictions
16 and prohibitions within the Safety Zone; and (2) enter into an agreement with one or more
17 state agencies, local governments, local governmental agencies in the Region or the Tahoe
18 transportation district to develop public parking, provide parking enforcement and issue
19 parking citations or notices of noncompliance within the Safety Zone. Section 1 further
20 authorizes the Department to: (1) establish and collect fees for public parking on certain land
21 within the Safety Zone; and (2) enter into agreements with certain governmental entities to
Assembly Amendment No. 742 to Senate Bill No. 426 Second Reprint Page 4
22 enforce and collect fees for parking within the Safety Zone. The proceeds of: (1) such fees
23 must be used to manage parking in the Lake Tahoe Region; and (2) any fines imposed for
24 violations of a parking restriction or prohibition, with certain exceptions, must be used for
25 parking enforcement within the Safety Zone.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Section 1. Chapter 484B of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. The Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Byway Corridor Recreation Safety Zone is
4 hereby created in the Lake Tahoe Region, consisting of any portion of U.S.
5 Highway 50, Nevada State Route 28, Nevada State Route 431 and Nevada State
6 Route 207 that is located in the Lake Tahoe Region and directly connected to a
7 recreational destination or that has otherwise been designated as a Scenic Byway.
8 2. Within the Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Byway Corridor Recreation Safety
9 Zone, the Department of Transportation and any local law enforcement agency

18 vehicle on a highway in the Safety Zone or would duly interfere with the free
19 movement of traffic on such highway.
20  A person shall not stop, park or leave standing any vehicle in violation of a
21 traffic control device, prohibition or restriction established pursuant to this
22 subsection.
23 3. In addition to the provisions of subsection 2:
24 (a) The Department of Transportation may, on any land owned or held by
25 the Department of Transportation:
26 (1) Establish and collect fees for public parking; and
27 (2) Enter into an agreement with one or more state agencies, local
28 governments, local governmental agencies or the Tahoe transportation district, as
29 applicable, to enforce and collect any fee established pursuant to this paragraph
30 for public parking; and

40 pursuant to subsection 2.
41 4. Any agreement entered into pursuant to subsection 3:
42 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), may authorize the state
43 agency, local government, local governmental agency or the Tahoe
Assembly Amendment No. 742 to Senate Bill No. 426 Second Reprint Page 5

2 state agency, local government, local governmental agency or Tahoe
3 transportation district, as applicable, to issue citations or notices of
4 noncompliance, manually or electronically, for a violation of any parking
5 restriction or prohibition established pursuant to subsection 2 or a requirement to
6 pay a fee established pursuant to subsection 3. A citation or notice of
7 noncompliance authorized by this paragraph and issued pursuant to the

27 5. A state agency, local government or local governmental agency that
28 appoints an employee to issue citations or notices of noncompliance pursuant to
29 subsection 4 is not liable for the negligent acts or omissions of such an employee
30 unless:
31 (a) The employee made a specific promise or representation to a natural
32 person who relied upon the promise or representation to the person’s detriment;
33 or
34 (b) The conduct of the employee affirmatively caused the harm.
35  The provisions of this section are not intended to abrogate the principle of
36 common law that the duty of governmental entities to provide services is a duty
37 owed to the public, not to individual persons.
38 6. Any fee established by the Department of Transportation pursuant to
39 subsection 3 and collected by the Department of Transportation, a state agency, a
