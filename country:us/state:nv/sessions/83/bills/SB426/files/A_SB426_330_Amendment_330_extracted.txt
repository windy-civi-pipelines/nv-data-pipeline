EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [governmental administration; imposing a transit surcharge on
the per night rental of transient lodging in the Lake Tahoe Basin and
setting forth the permissible uses of those transit surcharges;
establishing] public safety; creating the Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic
Byway Corridor Recreation Safety Zone; authorizing [the Tahoe
transportation district] certain entities to establish certain parking
restrictions and prohibitions and enter into [an agreement]
agreements with [one or more local governments] other
governmental entities to provide parking enforcement and collect
parking fees within the Safety Zone; [authorizing any board of county
commissioners of a county located upon any publicly owned property
or right-of-way in the Lake Tahoe Basin to construct, acquire, install,
equip, maintain, operate and regulate parking facilities;] providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, an interstate agreement
2 between the States of California and Nevada pursuant to which the bistate Tahoe Regional
3 Planning Agency regulates environmental and land-use matters within the Lake Tahoe Basin.
4 (NRS 277.190-277.220) The Tahoe Regional Planning Compact provides for the creation of
5 the Tahoe transportation district as a special purpose district managed by a board of directors
6 which develops and implements transportation plans and programs for the Lake Tahoe Basin.
7 [While Congressional approval is generally required to amend the Compact, the Compact
8 specifically grants the authority to the legislatures of the states of California and Nevada to, by
9 substantively identical enactments, amend the article of the Compact relating to the Tahoe
Senate Amendment No. 330 to Senate Bill No. 426 Page 4
10 transportation district. (NRS 277.200) This bill proposes to enact various changes to this
11 article of the Compact relating to the Tahoe transportation district.
12 First, section 1 of this bill imposes, with certain exceptions, a transit surcharge on the per
13 night rental of transient lodging in the amount of $4.00 within the Tahoe region in the State of
14 California and $4.25 within the Tahoe region in the State of Nevada. The proceeds of these
15 transit surcharges must be: (1) distributed to Tahoe transportation district; and (2) used to
16 support transportation in the Tahoe region, except that $0.25 of the surcharge imposed in the
17 Tahoe region in the State of Nevada must be distributed to the Tahoe Science Advisory
18 Council to support its activities in the Tahoe region.
19 Second, section] Existing law also establishes the State Route 159 Safety Speed Zone
20 and authorizes the Director of the Department of Transportation to set the maximum
21 speed in the Speed Zone and the Department to ensure that adequate signage and notice
22 are installed. (NRS 484B.621) Section 1 of this bill creates the Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic
23 Byway Corridor Recreation Safety Zone, consisting of any portion of U.S. Highway 50,
24 [California State Route 28,] Nevada State Route 28 , [and] Nevada State Route 431 and
25 Nevada State Route 207 that is located in the Lake Tahoe [region] Region and directly
26 connected to a recreational destination or that has otherwise been designated as a scenic
27 byway. Section 1 [further] authorizes the [Tahoe transportation district] Department and
28 local law enforcement agencies to : (1) establish certain traffic control measures and
29 parking restrictions and prohibitions within the Safety Zone; and (2) enter into an
30 agreement with one or more state agencies, local governments , local governmental agencies
31 in the region or the Tahoe transportation district to develop public parking, provide
32 parking enforcement and issue parking citations or notices of noncompliance within the
33 Safety Zone . [. If the district enters into such an agreement, the Tahoe transportation district
34 may enter into a contract with a private company to provide such parking enforcement
35 services but such a contract must not order, mandate or require the issuance of a certain
36 number of parking citations or otherwise base a payment to the private company on the
37 number of parking citations issued by the private company.
38 Finally, section 1 authorizes the board of county commissioners in the Tahoe region to,
39 upon any publicly owned property or right-of-way, construct, acquire, install, equip, maintain,
40 operate and regulate parking facilities or parking spaces for use by the general public.]
41 Section 1 further authorizes [such a board of county commissioners] the Department to: (1)
42 establish and collect fees for public parking on certain land within the Safety Zone; and
43 (2) enter into [a contact, lease or other arrangement with the Tahoe transportation district to
44 operate certain] agreements with certain government entities to enforce and collect fees
45 for parking [facilities or parking spaces; and (2) fix and charge reasonable fees for the use of
46 any such parking facility or parking space.] within the Safety Zone. The proceeds of [the] :
47 (1) such fees [for use of such parking that is along California State Route 28 or Nevada State
48 Route 28 and connected to any recreational trail] must be used to [administer] manage
49 parking [management programs and operate and maintain parking facilities or associated
50 facilities, including sanitation, signage, recreational trails and public transit.] in the Safety
51 Zone; and (2) any fines imposed by a parking restriction or prohibition, with certain
52 exceptions, must be used for parking enforcement within the Safety Zone.
