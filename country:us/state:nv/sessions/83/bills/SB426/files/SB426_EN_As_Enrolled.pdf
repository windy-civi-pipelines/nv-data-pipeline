State Route 431 and Nevada State Route 207 that is located in the Lake Tahoe
Region and directly connected to a recreational destination or that has otherwise
been designated as a scenic byway. Section 1 authorizes the Department and
certain local law enforcement agencies to: (1) establish certain traffic control
measures and parking restrictions and prohibitions within the Safety Zone; and (2)
enter into an agreement with one or more state agencies, local governments, local
governmental agencies in the Region or the Tahoe transportation district to develop

within the Safety Zone; and (2) enter into agreements with certain governmental
entities to enforce and collect fees for parking within the Safety Zone. The proceeds
of: (1) such fees must be used to manage parking in the Lake Tahoe Region; and
