Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, an interstate
2 agreement between the States of California and Nevada pursuant to which the
3 bistate Tahoe Regional Planning Agency regulates environmental and land-use
4 matters within the Lake Tahoe Basin. (NRS 277.190-277.220) The Tahoe Regional
5 Planning Compact provides for the creation of the Tahoe transportation district as a
6 special purpose district managed by a board of directors which develops and
7 implements transportation plans and programs for the Lake Tahoe Basin. While

8 Congressional approval is generally required to amend the Compact, the Compact
9 specifically grants the authority to the legislatures of the states of California and
10 Nevada to, by substantively identical enactments, amend the article of the Compact
11 relating to the Tahoe transportation district. (NRS 277.200) This bill proposes to
12 enact various changes to this article of the Compact relating to the Tahoe
13 transportation district.
14 First, section 1 of this bill imposes, with certain exceptions, a transit surcharge
15 on the per night rental of transient lodging in the amount of $4.00 within the Tahoe
16 region in the State of California and $4.25 within the Tahoe region in the State of
17 Nevada. The proceeds of these transit surcharges must be: (1) distributed to Tahoe
18 transportation district; and (2) used to support transportation in the Tahoe region,
19 except that $0.25 of the surcharge imposed in the Tahoe region in the State of
20 Nevada must be distributed to the Tahoe Science Advisory Council to support its
21 activities in the Tahoe region.
22 Second, section 1 creates the Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Byway Corridor
23 Recreation Safety Zone, consisting of any portion of U.S. Highway 50, California
24 State Route 28, Nevada State Route 28 and Nevada State Route 431 that is located
25 in the Tahoe region and directly connected to a recreational destination or that has
26 otherwise been designated as a scenic byway. Section 1 further authorizes the
27 Tahoe transportation district to enter into an agreement with one or more local
28 governments in the region to provide parking enforcement within the Safety Zone.
29 If the district enters into such an agreement, the Tahoe transportation district may
30 enter into a contract with a private company to provide such parking enforcement
31 services but such a contract must not order, mandate or require the issuance of a
32 certain number of parking citations or otherwise base a payment to the private
33 company on the number of parking citations issued by the private company.
34 Finally, section 1 authorizes the board of county commissioners in the Tahoe
35 region to, upon any publicly owned property or right-of-way, construct, acquire,
36 install, equip, maintain, operate and regulate parking facilities or parking spaces for
37 use by the general public. Section 1 further authorizes such a board of county
38 commissioners to: (1) enter into a contact, lease or other arrangement with the
39 Tahoe transportation district to operate certain parking facilities or parking spaces;
40 and (2) fix and charge reasonable fees for the use of any such parking facility or
41 parking space. The proceeds of the fees for use of such parking that is along
42 California State Route 28 or Nevada State Route 28 and connected to any
43 recreational trail must be used to administer parking management programs and
44 operate and maintain parking facilities or associated facilities, including sanitation,
45 signage, recreational trails and public transit.

*SB426*

– 11 –
1 at least one public hearing thereon after due notice as required in

5 affected by such amendment; or
6 (2) The owner or lessee of real property which would be
7 affected by such amendment,
8  the governing body shall complete its action on such amendment

10 according to standards which must be prescribed by ordinance of the
11 agency.
12 (b) The agency shall develop, in cooperation with the states of
13 California and Nevada, environmental threshold carrying capacities
14 for the region. The agency should request the President’s Council on
15 Environmental Quality, the United States Forest Service and other
16 appropriate agencies to assist in developing such environmental
17 threshold carrying capacities. Within 18 months after the effective
18 date of the amendments to this compact, the agency shall adopt
19 environmental threshold carrying capacities for the region.
20 (c) Within 1 year after the adoption of the environmental
21 threshold carrying capacities for the region, the agency shall amend
22 the regional plan so that, at a minimum, the plan and all of its
23 elements, as implemented through agency ordinances, rules and
24 regulations, achieves and maintains the adopted environmental
25 threshold carrying capacities. Each element of the plan shall contain
26 implementation provisions and time schedules for such
27 implementation by ordinance. The planning commission and
28 governing body shall continuously review and maintain the regional
29 plan and, in so doing, shall ensure that the regional plan reflects

42 population densities and permitted uses.
43 (2) A transportation plan for the integrated development of a
44 regional system of transportation, including but not limited to
45 parkways, highways, transportation facilities, transit routes,
-
*SB426*

– 12 –
1 waterways, navigation facilities, public transportation facilities,
2 bicycle facilities, and appurtenant terminals and facilities for the
3 movement of people and goods within the region. The goal of
4 transportation planning shall be:
5 (A) To reduce dependency on the automobile by making more
6 effective use of existing transportation modes and of public transit
7 to move people and goods within the region; and
8 (B) To reduce to the extent feasible air pollution which is caused
9 by motor vehicles.
10  Where increases in capacity are required, the agency shall give
11 preference to providing such capacity through public transportation
12 and public programs and projects related to transportation. The
13 agency shall review and consider all existing transportation plans in
14 preparing its regional transportation plan pursuant to this paragraph.
15 The plan shall provide for an appropriate transit system for the
16 region.
17 The plan shall give consideration to:
18 (A) Completion of the Loop Road in the states of Nevada and

20 (B) Utilization of a light rail mass transit system in the South
21 Shore area; and
22 (C) Utilization of a transit terminal in the Kingsbury Grade area.
23  Until the regional plan is revised, or a new transportation plan is
24 adopted in accordance with this paragraph, the agency has no
25 effective transportation plan.

31 (4) A recreation plan for the development, utilization, and
32 management of the recreational resources of the region, including
33 but not limited to, wilderness and forested lands, parks and
34 parkways, riding and hiking trails, beaches and playgrounds,
35 marinas, areas for skiing and other recreational facilities.
36 (5) A public services and facilities plan for the general location,
37 scale and provision of public services and facilities, which, by the
38 nature of their function, size, extent and other characteristics are
39 necessary or appropriate for inclusion in the regional plan.
40 In formulating and maintaining the regional plan, the planning
41 commission and governing body shall take account of and shall seek
42 to harmonize the needs of the region as a whole, the plans of the
43 counties and cities within the region, the plans and planning
44 activities of the state, federal and other public agencies and
-
*SB426*

– 13 –
1 nongovernmental agencies and organizations which affect or are
2 concerned with planning and development within the region.
3 (d) The regional plan shall provide for attaining and maintaining
4 federal, state, or local air and water quality standards, whichever are
5 strictest, in the respective portions of the region for which the
6 standards are applicable.
7 The agency may, however, adopt air or water quality standards
8 or control measures more stringent than the applicable state
9 implementation plan or the applicable federal, state, or local
10 standards for the region, if it finds that such additional standards or
11 control measures are necessary to achieve the purposes of this
12 compact. Each element of the regional plan, where applicable, shall,
13 by ordinance, identify the means and time schedule by which air and
14 water quality standards will be attained.
15 (e) Except for the Regional Transportation Plan of the California
16 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the regional plan, ordinances,
17 rules and regulations adopted by the California Tahoe Regional
18 Planning Agency in effect on July 1, 1980, shall be the regional
19 plan, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Tahoe Regional
20 Planning Agency for that portion of the Tahoe region located in the
21 State of California. Such plan, ordinance, rule or regulation may be
22 amended or repealed by the governing body of the agency. The
23 plans, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Tahoe Regional
24 Planning Agency that do not conflict with, or are not addressed by,
25 the California Tahoe Regional Planning Agency’s plans, ordinances,
26 rules and regulations referred to in this subdivision shall continue to
27 be applicable unless amended or repealed by the governing body of
28 the agency. No provision of the regional plan, ordinances, rules and
29 regulations of the California Tahoe Regional Planning Agency
30 referred to in this subdivision shall apply to that portion of the
31 region within the State of Nevada, unless such provision is adopted
32 for the Nevada portion of the region by the governing body of the
33 agency.
34 (f) The regional plan, ordinances, rules and regulations of the
35 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency apply to that portion of the region
36 within the State of Nevada.
37 (g) The agency shall adopt ordinances prescribing specific
38 written findings that the agency must make prior to approving any
39 project in the region. These findings shall relate to environmental
40 protection and shall insure that the project under review will not
41 adversely affect implementation of the regional plan and will not
42 cause the adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities of the
43 region to be exceeded.
44 (h) The agency shall maintain the data, maps and other
45 information developed in the course of formulating and
-
*SB426*

– 14 –
1 administering the regional plan, in a form suitable to assure a
2 consistent view of developmental trends and other relevant
3 information for the availability of and use by other agencies of
4 government and by private organizations and individuals concerned.
5 (i) Where necessary for the realization of the regional plan, the
6 agency may engage in collaborative planning with local
7 governmental jurisdictions located outside the region, but
8 contiguous to its boundaries. In formulating and implementing the
9 regional plan, the agency shall seek the cooperation and consider the
10 recommendations of counties and cities and other agencies of local
11 government, of state and federal agencies, of educational institutions
12 and research organizations, whether public or private, and of civic
13 groups and private persons.

15 ARTICLE VI. Agency’s Powers
16
17 (a) The governing body shall adopt all necessary ordinances,
18 rules, and regulations to effectuate the adopted regional plan. Except
19 as otherwise provided in this compact, every such ordinance, rule or
20 regulation shall establish a minimum standard applicable throughout
21 the region. Any political subdivision or public agency may adopt
22 and enforce an equal or higher requirement applicable to the same
23 subject of regulation in its territory. The regulations of the agency
24 shall contain standards including but not limited to the following:
25 water purity and clarity; subdivision; zoning; tree removal; solid
26 waste disposal; sewage disposal; land fills, excavations, cuts and
27 grading; piers, harbors, breakwaters or channels and other shoreline
28 developments; waste disposal in shoreline areas; waste disposal
29 from boats; mobile-home parks; house relocation; outdoor
30 advertising; floodplain protection; soil and sedimentation control;
31 air pollution; and watershed protection. Whenever possible without
32 diminishing the effectiveness of the regional plan, the ordinances,
33 rules, regulations and policies shall be confined to matters which are
34 general and regional in application, leaving to the jurisdiction of the
35 respective states, counties and cities the enactment of specific and
36 local ordinances, rules, regulations and policies which conform to
37 the regional plan.
38 The agency shall prescribe by ordinance those activities which it
39 has determined will not have substantial effect on the land, water,
40 air, space or any other natural resources in the region and therefore
41 will be exempt from its review and approval.
42 Every ordinance adopted by the agency shall be published at
43 least once by title in a newspaper or combination of newspapers
44 whose circulation is general throughout the region. Except an
45 ordinance adopting or amending the regional plan, no ordinance
-
*SB426*

– 15 –
1 shall become effective until 60 days after its adoption. Immediately
2 after its adoption, a copy of each ordinance shall be transmitted to
3 the governing body of each political subdivision having territory
4 within the region.
5 (b) No project other than those to be reviewed and approved
6 under the special provisions of subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (g) may
7 be developed in the region without obtaining the review and
8 approval of the agency and no project may be approved unless it is
9 found to comply with the regional plan and with the ordinances,
10 rules and regulations enacted pursuant to subdivision (a) to
11 effectuate that plan.
12 The agency may approve a project in the region only after
13 making the written findings required by this subdivision or
14 subdivision (g) of Article V. Such findings shall be based on
15 substantial evidence in the record.
16 Before adoption by the agency of the ordinances required in
17 subdivision (g) of Article V, the agency may approve a project in
18 the region only after making written findings on the basis of
19 substantial evidence in the record that the project is consistent with
20 the regional plan then in effect and with applicable plans,
21 ordinances, regulations, and standards of federal and state agencies
22 relating to the protection, maintenance and enhancement of
23 environmental quality in the region.
24 (c) The legislatures of the states of California and Nevada find
25 that in order to make effective the regional plan as revised by the
26 agency, it is necessary to halt temporarily works of development in
27 the region which might otherwise absorb the entire capability of the
28 region for further development or direct it out of harmony with the
29 ultimate plan. Subject to the limitation provided in this subdivision,
30 from the effective date of the amendments to this compact until the
31 regional plan is amended pursuant to subdivision (c) of Article V, or
32 until May 1, 1983, whichever is earlier:
33 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no new
34 subdivision, planned unit development, or condominium project
35 may be approved unless a complete tentative map or plan has been
36 approved before the effective date of the amendments to this
37 compact by all agencies having jurisdiction. The subdivision of land
38 owned by a general improvement district, which existed and owned
39 the land before the effective date of the amendments to this
40 compact, may be approved if subdivision of the land is necessary to
41 avoid insolvency of the district.
42 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), no apartment building
43 may be erected unless the required permits for such building have
44 been secured from all agencies having jurisdiction, prior to the
45 effective date of the amendments to this compact.

1 (3) During each of the calendar years 1980, 1981 and 1982, no
2 city or county may issue building permits which authorize the
3 construction of a greater number of new residential units within the
4 region than were authorized within the region by building permits
5 issued by that city or county during the calendar year 1978. For the
6 period of January through April, 1983, building permits authorizing
7 the construction of no more than one-third of that number may be
8 issued by each such city or county. For purposes of this paragraph a
9 “residential unit” means either a single family residence or an
10 individual residential unit within a larger building, such as an
11 apartment building, a duplex or a condominium.
12 The legislatures find the respective numbers of residential units
13 authorized within the region during the calendar year 1978 to be as
14 follows:
15 1. City of South Lake Tahoe and El Dorado
16 County (combined) ................................................................ 252
17 2. Placer County ............................................................ 278
18 3. Carson City ................................................................ -0-
19 4. Douglas County ......................................................... 339
20 5. Washoe County .......................................................... 739
21 (4) During each of the calendar years 1980, 1981 and 1982, no
22 city or county may issue building permits which authorize
23 construction of a greater square footage of new commercial
24 buildings within the region than were authorized within the region
25 by building permits for commercial purposes issued by that city or
26 county during the calendar year 1978. For the period of January
27 through April, 1983, building permits authorizing the construction
28 of no more than one-third the amount of that square footage may be
29 issued by each such city or county.
30 The legislatures find the respective square footages of
31 commercial buildings authorized within the region during calendar
32 year 1978 to be as follows:
33 1. City of South Lake Tahoe and El Dorado
34 County (combined) ................................................................ 64,324
35 2. Placer County ............................................................ 23,000
36 3. Carson City ................................................................ -0-
37 4. Douglas County ......................................................... 57,354
38 5. Washoe County .......................................................... 50,600
39 (5) No structure may be erected to house gaming under a
40 nonrestricted license.
41 (6) No facility for the treatment of sewage may be constructed
42 or enlarged except:
43 (A) To comply, as ordered by the appropriate state agency for
44 the control of water pollution, with existing limitations of effluent
-
*SB426*

– 17 –
1 under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq., and the
2 applicable state law for control of water pollution;
3 (B) To accommodate development which is not prohibited or
4 limited by this subdivision; or
5 (C) In the case of Douglas County Lake Tahoe Sewer Authority,
6 to modify or otherwise alter sewage treatment facilities existing on
7 the effective date of the amendments to this compact so that such
8 facilities will be able to treat the total volume of effluent for which
9 they were originally designed, which is 3.0 million gallons per day.
10 Such modification or alteration is not a “project”; is not subject to
11 the requirements of Article VII; and does not require a permit from
12 the agency. Before commencing such modification or alteration,
13 however, the Authority shall submit to the agency its report
14 identifying any significant soil erosion problems which may be
15 caused by such modifications or alterations and the measures which
16 the Authority proposes to take to mitigate or avoid such problems.
17 The moratorium imposed by this subdivision does not apply to
18 work done pursuant to a right vested before the effective date of the
19 amendments to this compact. Notwithstanding the expiration date of
20 the moratorium imposed by this subdivision, no new highway may
21 be built or existing highway widened to accommodate additional
22 continuous lanes for automobiles until the regional transportation
23 plan is revised and adopted.
24 The moratorium imposed by this subdivision does not apply to
25 the construction of any parking garage which has been approved by
26 the agency prior to May 4, 1979, whether that approval was
27 affirmative or by default. The provisions of this paragraph are not an
28 expression of legislative intent that any such parking garage, the
29 approval of which is the subject of litigation which was pending on
30 the effective date of the amendments to this compact, should or
31 should not be constructed. The provisions of this paragraph are
32 intended solely to permit construction of such a parking garage if a
33 judgment sustaining the agency’s approval to construct that parking
34 garage has become final and no appeal is pending or may lawfully
35 be taken to a higher court.
36 (d) Subject to the final order of any court of competent
37 jurisdiction entered in litigation contesting the validity of an
38 approval by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, whether that
39 approval was affirmative or by default, if that litigation was pending
40 on May 4, 1979, the agency and the states of California and Nevada
41 shall recognize as a permitted and conforming use:
42 (1) Every structure housing gaming under a nonrestricted license
43 which existed as a licensed gaming establishment on May 4, 1979,
44 or whose construction was approved by the Tahoe Regional
45 Planning Agency affirmatively or deemed approved before that date.
-
*SB426*

– 18 –
1 The construction or use of any structure to house gaming under a
2 nonrestricted license not so existing or approved, or the enlargement
3 in cubic volume of any such existing or approved structure is
4 prohibited.
5 (2) Every other nonrestricted gaming establishment whose use
6 was seasonal and whose license was issued before May 4, 1979, for
7 the same season and for the number and type of games and slot
8 machines on which taxes or fees were paid in the calendar year
9 1978.
10 (3) Gaming conducted pursuant to a restricted gaming license
11 issued before May 4, 1979, to the extent permitted by that license on
12 that date.
13  The area within any structure housing gaming under a
14 nonrestricted license which may be open to public use (as distinct
15 from that devoted to the private use of guests and exclusive of any
16 parking area) is limited to the area existing or approved for public
17 use on May 4, 1979. Within these limits, any external modification
18 of the structure which requires a permit from a local government
19 also requires approval from the agency. The agency shall not permit
20 restaurants, convention facilities, showrooms or other public areas
21 to be constructed elsewhere in the region outside the structure in
22 order to replace areas existing or approved for public use on May 4,
23 1979.
24 (e) Any structure housing licensed gaming may be rebuilt or
25 replaced to a size not to exceed the cubic volume, height and land
26 coverage existing or approved on May 4, 1979, without the review
27 or approval of the agency or any planning or regulatory authority of
28 the State of Nevada whose review or approval would be required for
29 a new structure.
30 (f) The following provisions apply to any internal or external
31 modification, remodeling, change in use, or repair of a structure
32 housing gaming under a nonrestricted license which is not
33 prohibited by Article VI (d):
34 (1) The agency’s review of an external modification of the
35 structure which requires a permit from a local government is limited
36 to determining whether the external modification will do any of the
37 following:
38 (A) Enlarge the cubic volume of the structure;
39 (B) Increase the total square footage of area open to or approved
40 for public use on May 4, 1979;
41 (C) Convert an area devoted to the private use of guests to an
42 area open to public use;
43 (D) Increase the public area open to public use which is used for
44 gaming beyond the limits contained in paragraph (3); and
-
*SB426*

– 19 –
1 (E) Conflict with or be subject to the provisions of any of the
2 agency’s ordinances that are generally applicable throughout the
3 region.
4  The agency shall make this determination within 60 days after the
5 proposal is delivered to the agency in compliance with the agency’s
6 rules or regulations governing such delivery unless the applicant has
7 agreed to an extension of this time limit. If an external modification
8 is determined to have any of the effects enumerated in
9 subparagraphs (A) through (C), it is prohibited. If an external
10 modification is determined to have any of the effects enumerated in
11 subparagraph (D) or (E), it is subject to the applicable provisions of
12 this compact. If an external modification is determined to have no
13 such effect, it is not subject to the provisions of this compact.
14 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), internal modification,
15 remodeling, change in use or repair of a structure housing gaming
16 under a nonrestricted license is not a project and does not require the
17 review or approval of the agency.
18 (3) Internal modification, remodeling, change in use or repair of
19 areas open to public use within a structure housing gaming under a
20 nonrestricted license which alone or in combination with any other
21 such modification, remodeling, change in use or repair will increase
22 the total portion of those areas which is actually used for gaming by
23 more than the product of the total base area, as defined below, in
24 square feet existing on or approved before August 4, 1980,
25 multiplied by 15 percent constitutes a project and is subject to all of
26 the provisions of this compact relating to projects. For purposes of
27 this paragraph and the determination required by Article VI (g), base
28 area means all of the area within a structure housing gaming under a
29 nonrestricted license which may be open to public use, whether or
30 not gaming is actually conducted or carried on in that area, except
31 retail stores, convention centers and meeting rooms, administrative
32 offices, kitchens, maintenance and storage areas, rest rooms,
33 engineering and mechanical rooms, accounting rooms and counting
34 rooms.
35 (g) In order to administer and enforce the provisions of
36 paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) the State of Nevada, through its
37 appropriate planning or regulatory agency, shall require the owner
38 or licensee of a structure housing gaming under a nonrestricted
39 license to provide:
40 (1) Documents containing sufficient information for the Nevada
41 agency to establish the following relative to the structure:
42 (A) The location of its external walls;
43 (B) Its total cubic volume;
-
*SB426*

– 20 –
1 (C) Within its external walls, the area in square feet open or
2 approved for public use and the area in square feet devoted to or
3 approved for the private use of guests on May 4, 1979;
4 (D) The amount of surface area of land under the structure; and
5 (E) The base area as defined in paragraph (f)(3) in square feet
6 existing on or approved before August 4, 1980.
7 (2) An informational report whenever any internal modification,
8 remodeling, change in use, or repair will increase the total portion of
9 the areas open to public use which is used for gaming.
10 The Nevada agency shall transmit this information to the Tahoe
11 Regional Planning Agency.
12 (h) Gaming conducted pursuant to a restricted gaming license is
13 exempt from review by the agency if it is incidental to the primary
14 use of the premises.
15 (i) The provisions of subdivisions (d) and (e) are intended only
16 to limit gaming and related activities as conducted within a gaming
17 establishment, or construction designed to permit the enlargement of
18 such activities, and not to limit any other use of property zoned for
19 commercial use or the accommodation of tourists, as approved by
20 the agency.
21 (j) Legal actions arising out of or alleging a violation of the
22 provisions of this compact, of the regional plan or of an ordinance or
23 regulation of the agency or of a permit or a condition of a permit
24 issued by the agency are governed by the following provisions:
25 (1) This subdivision applies to:
26 (A) Actions arising out of activities directly undertaken by the
27 agency.
28 (B) Actions arising out of the issuance to a person of a lease,
29 permit, license or other entitlement for use by the agency.
30 (C) Actions arising out of any other act or failure to act by any
31 person or public agency.
32  Such legal actions may be filed and the provisions of this
33 subdivision apply equally in the appropriate courts of California and
34 Nevada and of the United States.
35 (2) Venue lies:
36 (A) If a civil or criminal action challenges an activity by the
37 agency or any person which is undertaken or to be undertaken upon
38 a parcel of real property, in the state or federal judicial district where
39 the real property is situated.
40 (B) If an action challenges an activity which does not involve a
41 specific parcel of land (such as an action challenging an ordinance
42 of the agency), in any state or federal court having jurisdiction
43 within the region.
44 (3) Any aggrieved person may file an action in an appropriate
45 court of the State of California or Nevada or of the United States
-
*SB426*

– 21 –
1 alleging noncompliance with the provisions of this compact or with
2 an ordinance or regulation of the agency. In the case of
3 governmental agencies, “aggrieved person” means the Tahoe
4 Regional Planning Agency or any state, federal or local agency. In
5 the case of any person other than a governmental agency who
6 challenges an action of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,
7 “aggrieved person” means any person who has appeared, either in
8 person, through an authorized representative, or in writing, before
9 the agency at an appropriate administrative hearing to register
10 objection to the action which is being challenged, or who had good
11 cause for not making such an appearance.
12 (4) A legal action arising out of the adoption or amendment of
13 the regional plan or of any ordinance or regulation of the agency, or
14 out of the granting or denial of any permit, shall be commenced
15 within 60 days after final action by the agency. All other legal
16 actions shall be commenced within 65 days after discovery of the
17 cause of action.
18 (5) In any legal action filed pursuant to this subdivision which
19 challenges an adjudicatory act or decision of the agency to approve
20 or disapprove a project, the scope of judicial inquiry shall extend
21 only to whether there was prejudicial abuse of discretion. Prejudicial
22 abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in
23 a manner required by law or if the act or decision of the agency was
24 not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.
25 In making such a determination the court shall not exercise its
26 independent judgment on evidence but shall only determine whether
27 the act or decision was supported by substantial evidence in light of
28 the whole record. In any legal action filed pursuant to this
29 subdivision which challenges a legislative act or decision of the
30 agency (such as the adoption of the regional plan and the enactment
31 of implementing ordinances), the scope of the judicial inquiry shall
32 extend only to the questions of whether the act or decision has been
33 arbitrary, capricious or lacking substantial evidentiary support or
34 whether the agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by
35 law.
36 (6) In addition to the provisions of paragraph (5) relating to
37 judicial inquiry:
38 (A) When adopting or amending a regional plan, the agency
39 shall act in accordance with the requirements of the compact and the
40 implementing ordinances, rules and regulations, and a party
41 challenging the regional plan has the burden of showing that the
42 regional plan is not in conformance with those requirements.
43 (B) When taking an action or making a decision, the agency
44 shall act in accordance with the requirements of the compact and the
45 regional plan, including the implementing ordinances, rules and
-
*SB426*

– 22 –
1 regulations, and a party challenging the action or decision has the
2 burden of showing that the act or decision is not in conformance
3 with those requirements.
4 (7) The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to any legal
5 proceeding pending on the date when this subdivision becomes
6 effective. Any such legal proceeding shall be conducted and
7 concluded under the provisions of law which were applicable prior
8 to the effective date of this subdivision.
9 (8) The security required for the issuance of a temporary
10 restraining order or preliminary injunction based upon an alleged
11 violation of this compact or any ordinance, plan, rule or regulation
12 adopted pursuant thereto is governed by the rule or statute
13 applicable to the court in which the action is brought, unless the
14 action is brought by a public agency or political subdivision to
15 enforce its own rules, regulations and ordinances in which case no
16 security shall be required.
17 (k) The agency shall monitor activities in the region and may
18 bring enforcement actions in the region to ensure compliance with
19 the regional plan and adopted ordinances, rules, regulations and
20 policies. If it is found that the regional plan, or ordinances, rules,
21 regulations and policies are not being enforced by a local
22 jurisdiction, the agency may bring action in a court of competent
23 jurisdiction to ensure compliance.
24 (l) Any person who violates any provision of this compact or of
25 any ordinance or regulation of the agency or of any condition of
26 approval imposed by the agency is subject to a civil penalty not to
27 exceed $5,000. Any such person is subject to an additional civil
28 penalty not to exceed $5,000 per day, for each day on which such a
29 violation persists. In imposing the penalties authorized by this
30 subdivision, the court shall consider the nature of the violation and
31 shall impose a greater penalty if it was willful or resulted from gross
32 negligence than if it resulted from inadvertence or simple
33 negligence.
34 (m) The agency is hereby empowered to initiate, negotiate and
35 participate in contracts and agreements among the local
36 governmental authorities of the region, or any other
37 intergovernmental contracts or agreements authorized by state or
38 federal law.
39 (n) Each intergovernmental contract or agreement shall provide
40 for its own funding and staffing, but this shall not preclude financial
41 contributions from the local authorities concerned or from
42 supplementary sources.
43 (o) Every record of the agency, whether public or not, shall be
44 open for examination to the Legislature and Controller of the State
45 of California and the legislative auditor of the State of Nevada.

1 (p) Approval by the agency of any project expires 3 years after
2 the date of final action by the agency or the effective date of the
3 amendments to this compact, whichever is later, unless construction
4 is begun within that time and diligently pursued thereafter, or the
5 use or activity has commenced. In computing the 3-year period any
6 period of time during which the project is the subject of a legal
7 action which delays or renders impossible the diligent pursuit of that
8 project shall not be counted. Any license, permit or certificate issued
9 by the agency which has an expiration date shall be extended by that
10 period of time during which the project is the subject of such legal
11 action as provided in this subdivision.
12 (q) The governing body shall maintain a current list of real
13 property known to be available for exchange with the United States
14 or with other owners of real property in order to facilitate exchanges
15 of real property by owners of real property in the region.

17 ARTICLE VII. Environmental Impact Statements
18
19 (a) The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency when acting upon
20 matters that have a significant effect on the environment shall:
21 (1) Utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach which will
22 insure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the
23 environmental design arts in planning and in decision making which
24 may have an impact on man’s environment;

7 (b) Prior to completing an environmental impact statement, the
8 agency shall consult with and obtain the comments of any federal,
9 state or local agency which has jurisdiction by law or special
10 expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved. Copies
11 of such statement and the comments and views of the appropriate
12 federal, state and local agencies which are authorized to develop and
13 enforce environmental standards shall be made available to the
14 public and shall accompany the project through the review
15 processes. The public shall be consulted during the environmental
16 impact statement process and views shall be solicited during a
17 public comment period not to be less than 60 days.
18 (c) Any environmental impact statement required pursuant to
19 this article need not repeat in its entirety any information or data
20 which is relevant to such a statement and is a matter of public record
21 or is generally available to the public, such as information contained
22 in an environmental impact report prepared pursuant to the
23 California Environmental Quality Act or a federal environmental
24 impact statement prepared pursuant to the National Environmental
25 Policy Act of 1969. However, such information or data shall be
26 briefly described in the environmental impact statement and its
27 relationship to the environmental impact statement shall be
28 indicated.
29 In addition, any person may submit information relative to a
30 proposed project which may be included, in whole or in part, in any
31 environmental impact statement required by this article.
32 (d) In addition to the written findings specified by agency
33 ordinance to implement the regional plan, the agency shall make
34 either of the following written findings before approving a project
35 for which an environmental impact statement was prepared:
36 (1) Changes or alterations have been required in or incorporated
37 into such project which avoid or reduce the significant adverse
38 environmental effects to a less than significant level; or
39 (2) Specific considerations, such as economic, social or
40 technical, make infeasible the mitigation measures or project
41 alternatives discussed in the environmental impact statement on the
42 project.
43  A separate written finding shall be made for each significant
44 effect identified in the environmental impact statement on the
-
*SB426*

– 25 –
1 project. All written findings must be supported by substantial
2 evidence in the record.

4 any person proposing a project subject to the provisions of this
5 compact in order to recover the estimated costs incurred by the
6 agency in preparing an environmental impact statement under this
7 article.
8 (f) The agency shall adopt by ordinance a list of classes of
9 projects which the agency has determined will not have a significant
10 effect on the environment and therefore will be exempt from the
11 requirement for the preparation of an environmental impact
12 statement under this article. Prior to adopting the list, the agency
13 shall make a written finding supported by substantial evidence in the
14 record that each class of projects will not have a significant effect on
15 the environment.

*SB426*

– 27 –
1 director of the department of transportation of the State of Nevada
2 may designate an alternate.
3 (c) Before a local transportation district appoints a member to
4 the board of directors pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b),
5 the local transportation district must enter into a written agreement
6 with the Tahoe transportation district that sets forth the
7 responsibilities of the districts for the establishment of policies and
8 the management of financial matters, including, but not limited to,
9 the distribution of revenue among the districts.
10 (d) The directors of the California Department of Transportation
11 and the department of transportation of the State of Nevada, or their
12 designated alternates, serve as nonvoting directors, but shall provide
13 technical and professional advice to the district as necessary and
14 appropriate.
15 (e) The vote of a majority of the directors must agree to take
16 action. If a majority of votes in favor of an action are not cast, an
17 action of rejection shall be deemed to have been taken.
18 (f) The Tahoe transportation district may by resolution establish

7 the purpose of obtaining services of the district. The tax proposed
8 must be general and of uniform operation throughout the region, and
9 may not be graduated in any way, except for a sales and use tax. If a
10 sales and use tax is approved by the voters as provided in this
11 paragraph, it may be administered by the states of California and
12 Nevada respectively in accordance with the laws that apply within
13 their respective jurisdictions and must not exceed a rate of 1 percent
14 of the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold
15 in the district. The district is prohibited from imposing any other tax
16 measured by gross or net receipts on business, an ad valorem tax, a
17 tax or charge that is assessed against people or vehicles as they enter
18 or leave the region, and any tax, direct or indirect, on gaming tables
19 and devices. Any such proposition must be submitted to the voters
20 of the district and shall become effective upon approval of the voters
21 voting on the proposition who reside in the State of California in
22 accordance with the laws that apply within that state and approval of
23 the voters voting on the proposition who reside in the State of

25 revenues from any such tax must be used for the service for which it
26 was imposed, and for no other purpose.
27 (10) Provide service from inside the region to convenient
28 airport, railroad and interstate bus terminals without regard to the
29 boundaries of the region.
30 (h) There is hereby imposed a transit surcharge on the per
31 night rental of transient lodging in the amount of $4.00 within the
32 region in California. The surcharge must be collected by the
33 operator of the transient lodging and remitted to the county where
34 the transient lodging is located. Each county shall distribute all
35 proceeds of the surcharge to the Tahoe transportation district. The
36 proceeds of all transit surcharges received by the Tahoe
37 transportation district pursuant to this paragraph must be used by
38 the district to support transportation in the region.
39 Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the board of
40 directors of the Tahoe transportation district may waive up to
41 $4.00 of the transit surcharge imposed pursuant to this paragraph
42 within a county if the board of county commissioners of that
43 county imposes a comparable surcharge for transportation in the
44 region. As used in this paragraph, “transient lodging” means any
-
*SB426*

– 29 –
1 transient lodging that is subject to the transient occupancy tax
2 pursuant to applicable California law.
3 (i) There is hereby imposed a transit surcharge on the per
4 night rental of transient lodging in the amount of $4.25 within the
5 region in Nevada. The surcharge must be collected by the operator
6 of the transient lodging and remitted to the county where the
7 transient lodging is located. Each county shall distribute all
8 proceeds of the surcharge to the Tahoe transportation district. Of
9 the proceeds received from a county pursuant to this paragraph,
10 the Tahoe transportation district shall distribute $0.25 of the per
11 night surcharge to the Tahoe Science Advisory Council to support
12 its activities within the region. The remainder of all transit
13 surcharges received by the Tahoe transportation district pursuant
14 to this paragraph must be used by the district to support
15 transportation in the region. The board of directors of the Tahoe
16 transportation district may waive up to $4.00 of the transit
17 surcharge imposed pursuant to this section within a county if the
18 board of county commissioners of that county imposes a
19 comparable surcharge for transportation in the region. If any
20 such waiver is granted, the $0.25 surcharge for the benefit of the
21 Tahoe Science Advisory Council must still be imposed, remitted
22 and distributed, as otherwise required in this paragraph. As used
23 in this paragraph, “transient lodging” means any transient
24 lodging that is subject to the taxes imposed on the rental of
25 transient lodging pursuant to applicable Nevada law.
26 (j) The Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Byway Corridor Recreation
27 Safety Zone is hereby created in the region, consisting of any
28 portion of U.S. Highway 50, California State Route 28, Nevada
29 State Route 28 and Nevada State Route 431 that is located in the

31 has otherwise been designated as a scenic byway. The Tahoe
32 transportation district may enter into an agreement with one or
33 more local governments in the region to provide parking
34 enforcement within the Safety Zone. If the district enters into such
35 an agreement, the Tahoe transportation district may enter into a
36 contract with a private company to provide such parking
37 enforcement services but such a contract must not order, mandate
38 or require the issuance of a certain number of parking citations or
39 otherwise base a payment to the private company on the number
40 of parking citations issued by the private company.
41 (k) Any board of county commissioners of a county in the
42 region may, upon any publicly owned property or right-of-way,
43 construct, acquire, install, equip, maintain, operate and regulate
44 parking facilities or parking spaces for use by the general public.
45 Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, such facilities or
-
*SB426*

– 30 –
1 spaces must be owned and operated by the county or its agents.
2 The board of county commissioners may enter into a contract,
3 lease or other arrangement with the Tahoe transportation district
4 for the district to operate the parking facilities or parking spaces
5 on behalf of the county. The board of county commissioners may
6 fix and charge reasonable fees for the use of any such parking
7 facility or parking space. The proceeds of the fees for the use of
8 any parking facility or parking space that is along California State
9 Route 28 or Nevada State Route 28 and is connected to any
10 recreational trail must be used to administer parking management
11 programs and operate and maintain parking facilities or
12 associated facilities, including, without limitation, sanitation,
13 signage, recreational trails and public transit.
14 (l) The legislatures of the states of California and Nevada may,
15 by substantively identical enactments, amend this article.
