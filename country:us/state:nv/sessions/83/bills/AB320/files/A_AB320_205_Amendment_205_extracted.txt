SUMMARY—Revises provisions related to [criminal] the administration of
justice. (BDR [14-810)] 1-810)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [criminal] the administration of justice; prohibiting courts
from [denying] penalizing defendants [in criminal actions] who have
been denied access to courtrooms [and proceedings] under certain
circumstances related to attire; [revising provisions relating to the
imposition of bail or conditions of release; requiring] authorizing the
Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety to
establish a pilot program relating to employment opportunities and
training for parolees and probationers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various provisions related to [criminal procedure.] the courts of
2 this State. (Title [14] 1 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) makes certain legislative
3 declarations recognizing the importance of access to the courts of this State and the
4 interest of the courts in maintaining order and decorum in the courtroom; and (2)
5 provides that the Legislature urges the courts not to create policies, rules or
6 administrative orders that unduly restrict access to justice based on the attire of the
7 parties. Section [1] 1.7 of this bill prohibits a court from [denying] imposing a penalty on a
8 defendant [in a criminal action] who is denied access to a courtroom [or judicial proceeding]
9 solely because of the attire of the defendant . [is not wearing formal or professional attire.
10 Existing law provides that a court may only impose bail or a condition of release, or both,
11 on a person if the imposition is the least restrictive means necessary to protect the safety of the
12 community or to ensure the appearance of the person in court. (NRS 178.4851) Existing law
13 requires a court to consider certain factors when making this determination. (NRS 178.4853,
14 178.498) Section 3 of this bill provides that the imposition of bail is not the least restrictive
15 means necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the appearance of the
16 person in court if the person is arrested for certain misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor
17 offenses and has no previous convictions. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
18 reflect the changes in section 3. Section 4 of this bill requires a court to consider additional
19 factors related to the participation of a person in an employment readiness, substance use
20 disorder treatment or mental health treatment program in making decisions regarding pretrial
21 release.]
Assembly Amendment No. 205 to Assembly Bill No. 320 Page 4
22 Section 5 of this bill [requires] authorizes the Division of Parole and Probation of the
23 Department of Public Safety to establish a pilot program to identify and develop employment
24 opportunities for and provide training on employment readiness to parolees and probationers.
25 Section 6 of this bill applies definitions in existing law relating to parole to section 5.

21 the community or to ensure that the person will appear at all times and places
22 ordered by the court, with regard to the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and

36 of release, or both, on a person. If the request includes the imposition of bail, the

38 imposition of bail is necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure
39 that the person will appear at all times and places ordered by the court, with regard
40 to the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and 178.498.
41 3. If a court imposes bail or any condition of release, or both, other than
42 release on recognizance with no other conditions of release, the court shall make
43 findings of fact for such a determination and state its reasoning on the record, and,

45 of fact must include why the condition of release constitutes the least restrictive
46 means necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure that the person
47 will appear at the times and places ordered by the court.
48 4. A person arrested for murder of the first degree may be admitted to bail
49 unless the proof is evident or the presumption great by any competent court or
50 magistrate authorized by law to do so in the exercise of discretion, giving due
51 weight to the evidence and to the nature and circumstances of the offense.
52 5. The imposition of bail is not the least restrictive means necessary to
53 protect the safety of the community or to ensure that the person will appear at all
Assembly Amendment No. 205 to Assembly Bill No. 320 Page 8
1 times and places ordered by the court, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor
2 or gross misdemeanor that is not a crime of violence and the person has not
3 previously been convicted of any offense. This subsection does not apply to any
4 bail that may be set pursuant to NRS 178.484.

7 releasing the person and as ordered by any court before which the charge is
8 subsequently heard;
9 (b) The person will comply with the other conditions which have been imposed
10 by the court and are stated in the document;
11 (c) If the person fails to appear when so ordered and is taken into custody
12 outside of this State, the person waives all rights relating to extradition proceedings;
13 and
14 (d) The person understands that any court of competent jurisdiction may
15 revoke the order of release without bail and may order the person into custody or
16 require the person to furnish bail or otherwise ensure the protection of the safety of
17 the community or the person’s appearance, if applicable.
18 [6.] 7. The document signed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 must be filed with
19 the clerk of the court of competent jurisdiction and becomes effective upon the
20 signature of the person to be released.
21 [7.] 8. If a person fails to comply with a condition of release imposed
22 pursuant to this section, the court may, after providing the person with reasonable
23 notice and an opportunity for a hearing:
24 (a) Deem such conduct a contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010;
25 (b) Impose such additional conditions of release as the court deems necessary
26 to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the person will appear at the
27 times and places ordered by the court;
28 (c) Increase the amount of bail pursuant to NRS 178.499, if applicable; or
29 (d) Revoke bail and remand the person into custody.
30 [8.] 9. If a person fails to appear as ordered by the court and a jurisdiction
31 incurs any costs in returning a person to the jurisdiction to stand trial, the person
32 failing to appear is responsible for paying those costs as restitution.
33 [9.] 10. An order issued pursuant to this section that imposes a condition on a
34 person must include a provision ordering a law enforcement officer to arrest the
35 person if the law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the person
36 has violated a condition of release.
37 [10.] 11. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a court to
38 receive the request of a prosecuting attorney before imposing a condition of release.
39 12. As used in this section, “crime of violence” means any offense involving
40 the use or threatened use of force or violence against another person.] (Deleted

SUMMARY—Revises provisions related to [criminal] the administration of
justice. (BDR [14-810)] 1-810)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [criminal] the administration of justice; prohibiting courts
from [denying] penalizing defendants [in criminal actions] who have
been denied access to courtrooms [and proceedings] under certain
circumstances related to attire; [revising provisions relating to the
imposition of bail or conditions of release; requiring] authorizing the
Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety to
establish a pilot program relating to employment opportunities and
training for parolees and probationers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various provisions related to [criminal procedure.] the courts of
2 this State. (Title [14] 1 of NRS) Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) makes certain legislative
3 declarations recognizing the importance of access to the courts of this State and the
4 interest of the courts in maintaining order and decorum in the courtroom; and (2)
5 provides that the Legislature urges the courts not to create policies, rules or
6 administrative orders that unduly restrict access to justice based on the attire of the
7 parties. Section [1] 1.7 of this bill prohibits a court from [denying] imposing a penalty on a
8 defendant [in a criminal action] who is denied access to a courtroom [or judicial proceeding]
9 solely because of the attire of the defendant . [is not wearing formal or professional attire.
10 Existing law provides that a court may only impose bail or a condition of release, or both,
11 on a person if the imposition is the least restrictive means necessary to protect the safety of the
12 community or to ensure the appearance of the person in court. (NRS 178.4851) Existing law
13 requires a court to consider certain factors when making this determination. (NRS 178.4853,
14 178.498) Section 3 of this bill provides that the imposition of bail is not the least restrictive
15 means necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the appearance of the
16 person in court if the person is arrested for certain misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor
17 offenses and has no previous convictions. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
18 reflect the changes in section 3. Section 4 of this bill requires a court to consider additional
19 factors related to the participation of a person in an employment readiness, substance use
20 disorder treatment or mental health treatment program in making decisions regarding pretrial
21 release.]

Assembly Amendment No. 205 to Assembly Bill No. 320 Page 4
22 Section 5 of this bill [requires] authorizes the Division of Parole and Probation of the
23 Department of Public Safety to establish a pilot program to identify and develop employment
24 opportunities for and provide training on employment readiness to parolees and probationers.
25 Section 6 of this bill applies definitions in existing law relating to parole to section 5.

11 [Section 1.] Sec. 1.7. [Chapter 169 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
12 thereto a new section to read as follows:]

49 violence pursuant to NRS 33.018 if the person has been convicted of such an
50 offense in this State or has been convicted of violating a law of any other
51 jurisdiction that prohibits the same or similar conduct.

48 NRS 200.591, or of violating a temporary or extended order for protection against

50  The provisions of this subsection do not affect the authority of a magistrate or a

Assembly Amendment No. 205 to Assembly Bill No. 320 Page 7

6 temporary or extended order for protection against stalking, aggravated stalking or
7 harassment issued pursuant to NRS 200.591, or of violating a temporary or

9 person has been convicted of such an offense in this State or has been convicted of
10 violating a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same or similar conduct.
11 10. For the purposes of subsections 8 and 9, an order or injunction is in the
12 nature of a temporary or extended order for protection against domestic violence if
13 it grants relief that might be given in a temporary or extended order issued pursuant
14 to NRS 33.017 to 33.100, inclusive.
15 11. As used in this section, “strangulation” has the meaning ascribed to it in
16 NRS 200.481.] (Deleted by amendment.)
17 Sec. 3. [NRS 178.4851 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 178.4851 1. Except as otherwise provided in [subsection] 4,] subsections 4
19 and 5, the court shall only impose bail or a condition of release, or both, on a
20 person as it deems to be the least restrictive means necessary to protect the safety of
21 the community or to ensure that the person will appear at all times and places
22 ordered by the court, with regard to the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and
23 178.498. Such conditions of release may include, without limitation:
24 (a) Requiring the person to remain in this State or a certain county within this
25 State;
26 (b) Prohibiting the person from contacting or attempting to contact a specific
27 person or from causing or attempting to cause another person to contact that person
28 on the person’s behalf;
29 (c) Prohibiting the person from entering a certain geographic area;
30 (d) Prohibiting the person from possessing a firearm during the pendency of
31 the case; or
32 (e) Prohibiting the person from engaging in specific conduct that may be
33 harmful to the person’s own health, safety or welfare, or the health, safety or
34 welfare of another person.
35 2. A prosecuting attorney may request that a court impose bail or a condition
36 of release, or both, on a person. If the request includes the imposition of bail, the
37 prosecuting attorney must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
38 imposition of bail is necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure
39 that the person will appear at all times and places ordered by the court, with regard
40 to the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and 178.498.
41 3. If a court imposes bail or any condition of release, or both, other than
42 release on recognizance with no other conditions of release, the court shall make
43 findings of fact for such a determination and state its reasoning on the record, and,
44 if the determination includes the imposition of a condition of release, the findings
45 of fact must include why the condition of release constitutes the least restrictive
46 means necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure that the person
47 will appear at the times and places ordered by the court.
48 4. A person arrested for murder of the first degree may be admitted to bail
49 unless the proof is evident or the presumption great by any competent court or
50 magistrate authorized by law to do so in the exercise of discretion, giving due
51 weight to the evidence and to the nature and circumstances of the offense.
52 5. The imposition of bail is not the least restrictive means necessary to
53 protect the safety of the community or to ensure that the person will appear at all

Assembly Amendment No. 205 to Assembly Bill No. 320 Page 8
1 times and places ordered by the court, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor
2 or gross misdemeanor that is not a crime of violence and the person has not
3 previously been convicted of any offense. This subsection does not apply to any
4 bail that may be set pursuant to NRS 178.484.
5 6. The person must sign a document before the person’s release stating that:
6 (a) The person will appear at all times and places as ordered by the court
7 releasing the person and as ordered by any court before which the charge is
8 subsequently heard;
9 (b) The person will comply with the other conditions which have been imposed
10 by the court and are stated in the document;
11 (c) If the person fails to appear when so ordered and is taken into custody
12 outside of this State, the person waives all rights relating to extradition proceedings;
13 and
14 (d) The person understands that any court of competent jurisdiction may
15 revoke the order of release without bail and may order the person into custody or
16 require the person to furnish bail or otherwise ensure the protection of the safety of
17 the community or the person’s appearance, if applicable.
18 [6.] 7. The document signed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 must be filed with
19 the clerk of the court of competent jurisdiction and becomes effective upon the
20 signature of the person to be released.
21 [7.] 8. If a person fails to comply with a condition of release imposed
22 pursuant to this section, the court may, after providing the person with reasonable
23 notice and an opportunity for a hearing:
24 (a) Deem such conduct a contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010;
25 (b) Impose such additional conditions of release as the court deems necessary
26 to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the person will appear at the
27 times and places ordered by the court;
28 (c) Increase the amount of bail pursuant to NRS 178.499, if applicable; or
29 (d) Revoke bail and remand the person into custody.
30 [8.] 9. If a person fails to appear as ordered by the court and a jurisdiction
31 incurs any costs in returning a person to the jurisdiction to stand trial, the person
32 failing to appear is responsible for paying those costs as restitution.
33 [9.] 10. An order issued pursuant to this section that imposes a condition on a
34 person must include a provision ordering a law enforcement officer to arrest the
35 person if the law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the person
36 has violated a condition of release.
37 [10.] 11. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a court to
38 receive the request of a prosecuting attorney before imposing a condition of release.
39 12. As used in this section, “crime of violence” means any offense involving
40 the use or threatened use of force or violence against another person.] (Deleted
41 by amendment.)
42 Sec. 4. [NRS 178.4853 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 178.4853 In reviewing the custody status of a person, the court at a minimum
44 shall consider the following factors concerning the person:
45 1. The length of residence in the community;
46 2. The status and history of employment;
47 3. The status and history of participation in a program for employment
48 readiness;
49 4. Relationships with the person’s spouse and children, parents or other
50 family members and with close friends;
51 [4.] 5. Reputation, character and mental condition;
52 6. The status and history of participation in a program of substance use
53 disorder treatment or mental health treatment;

Assembly Amendment No. 205 to Assembly Bill No. 320 Page 9
1 [5.] 7. Prior criminal record, including, without limitation, any record of
2 appearing or failing to appear after release on bail or without bail;
3 [6.] 8. The identity of responsible members of the community who would
4 vouch for the reliability of the person;
5 [7.] 9. The nature of the offense with which the person is charged, the
6 apparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence, insofar as these factors
7 relate to the risk of not appearing;
8 [8.] 10. The nature and seriousness of the danger to the alleged victim, any
9 other person or the community that would be posed by the person’s release;
10 [9.] 11. The likelihood of more criminal activity by the person after release;
11 and
12 [10.] 12. Any other factors concerning the person’s ties to the community or
13 bearing on the risk that the person may willfully fail to appear.] (Deleted by
14 amendment.)
15 Sec. 5. Chapter 213 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
16 section to read as follows:
17 1. The Division [shall,] may, by regulation, establish a pilot program to
18 identify and develop employment opportunities for and provide training on
19 employment readiness to parolees and probationers.
20 2. In establishing the pilot program, the Division [shall] may collaborate
21 with nonprofit organizations in the community that provide services to parolees
22 and probationers.
23 Sec. 6. NRS 213.107 is hereby amended to read as follows:
