EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal justice; prohibiting courts from
denying defendants in criminal actions access to
courtrooms and proceedings under certain circumstances
related to attire; revising provisions relating to the
imposition of bail or conditions of release; requiring the
Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of
Public Safety to establish a pilot program relating to
employment opportunities and training for parolees and
probationers; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various provisions related to criminal procedure. (Title
2 14 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a court from denying a defendant in a
3 criminal action access to a courtroom or judicial proceeding solely because the
4 defendant is not wearing formal or professional attire.
5 Existing law provides that a court may only impose bail or a condition of
6 release, or both, on a person if the imposition is the least restrictive means
7 necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the appearance of the
8 person in court. (NRS 178.4851) Existing law requires a court to consider certain
9 factors when making this determination. (NRS 178.4853, 178.498) Section 3 of this
10 bill provides that the imposition of bail is not the least restrictive means necessary
11 to protect the safety of the community or to ensure the appearance of the person in
12 court if the person is arrested for certain misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor
13 offenses and has no previous convictions. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming
14 change to reflect the changes in section 3. Section 4 of this bill requires a court to
15 consider additional factors related to the participation of a person in an employment
16 readiness, substance use disorder treatment or mental health treatment program in
17 making decisions regarding pretrial release.

22 relating to parole to section 5.

11 33.017 to 33.100, inclusive.
12 11. As used in this section, “strangulation” has the meaning
13 ascribed to it in NRS 200.481.
14 Sec. 3. NRS 178.4851 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 178.4851 1. Except as otherwise provided in [subsection 4,]
16 subsections 4 and 5, the court shall only impose bail or a condition
17 of release, or both, on a person as it deems to be the least restrictive
18 means necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure
19 that the person will appear at all times and places ordered by the
20 court, with regard to the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and
21 178.498. Such conditions of release may include, without limitation:
22 (a) Requiring the person to remain in this State or a certain
23 county within this State;

25 contact a specific person or from causing or attempting to cause

35 or a condition of release, or both, on a person. If the request includes
36 the imposition of bail, the prosecuting attorney must prove by clear
37 and convincing evidence that the imposition of bail is necessary to

39 appear at all times and places ordered by the court, with regard to
40 the factors set forth in NRS 178.4853 and 178.498.
41 3. If a court imposes bail or any condition of release, or both,
42 other than release on recognizance with no other conditions of
43 release, the court shall make findings of fact for such a
44 determination and state its reasoning on the record, and, if the
45 determination includes the imposition of a condition of release, the
-
*AB320*

– 7 –
1 findings of fact must include why the condition of release
2 constitutes the least restrictive means necessary to protect the safety
3 of the community or to ensure that the person will appear at the
4 times and places ordered by the court.
5 4. A person arrested for murder of the first degree may be
6 admitted to bail unless the proof is evident or the presumption great
7 by any competent court or magistrate authorized by law to do so in
8 the exercise of discretion, giving due weight to the evidence and to
9 the nature and circumstances of the offense.
10 5. The imposition of bail is not the least restrictive means
11 necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure that
12 the person will appear at all times and places ordered by the court,
13 if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor
14 that is not a crime of violence and the person has not previously
15 been convicted of any offense. This subsection does not apply to
16 any bail that may be set pursuant to NRS 178.484.
17 6. The person must sign a document before the person’s release
18 stating that:
19 (a) The person will appear at all times and places as ordered by
20 the court releasing the person and as ordered by any court before
21 which the charge is subsequently heard;
22 (b) The person will comply with the other conditions which
23 have been imposed by the court and are stated in the document;
24 (c) If the person fails to appear when so ordered and is taken
25 into custody outside of this State, the person waives all rights
26 relating to extradition proceedings; and
27 (d) The person understands that any court of competent
28 jurisdiction may revoke the order of release without bail and may
29 order the person into custody or require the person to furnish bail or
30 otherwise ensure the protection of the safety of the community or
31 the person’s appearance, if applicable.
32 [6.] 7. The document signed pursuant to subsection [5] 6 must
33 be filed with the clerk of the court of competent jurisdiction and
34 becomes effective upon the signature of the person to be released.
35 [7.] 8. If a person fails to comply with a condition of release
36 imposed pursuant to this section, the court may, after providing the
37 person with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing:
38 (a) Deem such conduct a contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010;
39 (b) Impose such additional conditions of release as the court
40 deems necessary to protect the safety of the community or to ensure
41 the person will appear at the times and places ordered by the court;
42 (c) Increase the amount of bail pursuant to NRS 178.499, if
43 applicable; or
44 (d) Revoke bail and remand the person into custody.

– 8 –
1 [8.] 9. If a person fails to appear as ordered by the court and a
2 jurisdiction incurs any costs in returning a person to the jurisdiction
3 to stand trial, the person failing to appear is responsible for paying
4 those costs as restitution.
5 [9.] 10. An order issued pursuant to this section that imposes a
6 condition on a person must include a provision ordering a law
7 enforcement officer to arrest the person if the law enforcement
8 officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated a
9 condition of release.
10 [10.] 11. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a
11 court to receive the request of a prosecuting attorney before
12 imposing a condition of release.

14 offense involving the use or threatened use of force or violence

17 178.4853 In reviewing the custody status of a person, the court
18 at a minimum shall consider the following factors concerning the
19 person:
20 1. The length of residence in the community;
21 2. The status and history of employment;
22 3. The status and history of participation in a program for
23 employment readiness;
24 4. Relationships with the person’s spouse and children, parents
25 or other family members and with close friends;
26 [4.] 5. Reputation, character and mental condition;
27 6. The status and history of participation in a program of

29 [5.] 7. Prior criminal record, including, without limitation, any
30 record of appearing or failing to appear after release on bail or
31 without bail;
32 [6.] 8. The identity of responsible members of the community
33 who would vouch for the reliability of the person;
34 [7.] 9. The nature of the offense with which the person is
35 charged, the apparent probability of conviction and the likely
36 sentence, insofar as these factors relate to the risk of not appearing;
37 [8.] 10. The nature and seriousness of the danger to the alleged
38 victim, any other person or the community that would be posed by
39 the person’s release;
40 [9.] 11. The likelihood of more criminal activity by the person
41 after release; and
42 [10.] 12. Any other factors concerning the person’s ties to the

44 to appear.
