AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting a food delivery
service platform provider from facilitating an online food
order involving a food dispensing establishment who has
not obtained certain required licenses; prohibiting such a
food dispensing establishment from accepting an online
food order; requiring a food delivery service platform

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions concerning food

3 online service or mobile application which allows users to purchase food from
4 multiple food dispensing establishments and arrange for the same-day delivery or
5 same-day pickup of such food. (NRS 597.7625-597.7642) Existing law designates a
6 person who operates such a platform as a food delivery service platform provider.
7 (NRS 597.7628) Existing law defines “food dispensing establishment” to mean, in
8 general, a food establishment that prepares and serves food intended for immediate
9 consumption. (NRS 597.7629)
10 Under existing law, a food delivery service platform provider is prohibited
11 from facilitating an online food order involving a food dispensing establishment,
12 including, without limitation, arranging for the same-day delivery or same-day
13 pickup of food prepared by a food dispensing establishment, unless the food
14 delivery service platform provider has entered into a written agreement with the
15 food dispensing establishment authorizing such activities. (NRS 597.7635)

16 This bill prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from facilitating an
17 online food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless the food

19 government in which the food dispensing establishment is located which authorizes
20 the food dispensing establishment to conduct business at the address at which the
21 food dispensing establishment prepares the online food order.
22 This bill also prohibits a food dispensing establishment from accepting an
23 online food order facilitated by a food delivery service platform provider unless the
24 food dispensing establishment has obtained any business license required by the
25 local government in which the food dispensing establishment is located which
26 authorizes the food dispensing establishment to conduct business at the address at
27 which the food dispensing establishment prepares the online food order. Under this
28 bill, a food dispensing establishment who violates this prohibition or provides to the
29 food delivery service platform provider false or misleading information regarding
30 the business license of the food dispensing establishment is subject to a civil
31 penalty not to exceed $100 for each online food order which the food dispensing
32 establishment fills in violation of the prohibition.
33 Finally, this bill requires a food delivery service platform provider to remove a
34 food dispensing establishment from the platform of the food delivery service
35 platform provider if the food delivery service platform provider receives specific,
36 verifiable information that the food dispensing establishment has accepted an
37 online food order in violation of the provisions of this bill or has provided to the
38 food delivery service platform provider false or misleading information regarding
39 the business license of the food dispensing establishment. This bill provides that a
40 food delivery service platform provider who fails to remove the food dispensing
41 establishment from the platform of the food delivery service platform provider is
42 subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day that the food dispensing
43 establishment remains on the platform after the 10th day after the food delivery
44 service platform provider receives the information.
