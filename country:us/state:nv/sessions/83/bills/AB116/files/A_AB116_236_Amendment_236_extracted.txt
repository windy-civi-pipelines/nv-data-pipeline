EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to trade practices; prohibiting a food delivery service platform
provider from facilitating an online food order involving a food
dispensing establishment [unless the operator of the food dispensing
establishment] who has not obtained [the] certain required [permit to
operate the food dispensing establishment issued by the health
authority;] licenses; prohibiting such a food dispensing
establishment from accepting an online food order; requiring a
food delivery service platform provider to remove such a food
dispensing establishment from the food delivery service platform
of the provider under certain circumstances; providing penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions concerning food delivery
2 service platforms, which existing law defines to mean an Internet website, online service or
3 mobile application which allows users to purchase food from multiple food dispensing
4 establishments and arrange for the same-day delivery or same-day pickup of such food. (NRS
5 597.7625-597.7642) Existing law designates a person who operates such a platform as a food
6 delivery service platform provider. (NRS 597.7628) Existing law defines “food dispensing
7 establishment” to mean, in general, a food establishment that prepares and serves food
8 intended for immediate consumption. (NRS 597.7629) [Existing law prohibits, with certain
9 exceptions, a person from operating a food establishment unless the person possesses a valid
10 permit issued to the person by the health authority. (NRS 446.870)]
11 Under existing law, a food delivery service platform provider is prohibited from
12 facilitating an online food order involving a food dispensing establishment, including, without
13 limitation, arranging for the same-day delivery or same-day pickup of food prepared by a food
14 dispensing establishment, unless the food delivery service platform provider has entered into a
15 written agreement with the food dispensing establishment authorizing such activities. (NRS
16 597.7635) [Although no penalty is specifically provided for violating that prohibition, existing
17 law provides that whenever the performance of any act is prohibited by any statute, and no
18 penalty for the violation of such statute is imposed, a person who commits that act is guilty of
19 a misdemeanor. (NRS 193.151)]
Assembly Amendment No. 236 to Assembly Bill No. 116 Page 4
20 This bill prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from facilitating an online
21 food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless [the operator of] the food
22 dispensing establishment has obtained [the required permit to operate] any business license
23 required by the local government in which the food dispensing establishment [issued by the
24 health authority.] is located which authorizes the food dispensing establishment to
25 conduct business at the address at which the food dispensing establishment prepares the
26 online food order.
27 This bill also prohibits a food dispensing establishment from accepting an online
28 food order facilitated by a food delivery service platform provider unless the food
29 dispensing establishment has obtained any business license required by the local
30 government in which the food dispensing establishment is located which authorizes the
31 food dispensing establishment to conduct business at the address at which the food
32 dispensing establishment prepares the online food order. Under this bill, a food
33 dispensing establishment who violates this prohibition or provides to the food delivery
34 service platform provider false or misleading information regarding the business license
35 of the food dispensing establishment is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100 for
36 each online food order which the food dispensing establishment fills in violation of the
37 prohibition.
38 Finally, this bill requires a food delivery service platform provider to remove a food
39 dispensing establishment from the platform of the food delivery service platform
40 provider if the food delivery service platform provider receives specific, verifiable
41 information that the food dispensing establishment has accepted an online food order in
42 violation of the provisions of this bill or has provided to the food delivery service
43 platform provider false or misleading information regarding the business license of the
44 food dispensing establishment. This bill [specifically] provides that a food delivery service
45 platform provider who [violates that prohibition or the prohibition against facilitating an
46 online food order without the written agreement with the food dispensing establishment
47 required under existing law is guilty of a misdemeanor.] fails to remove the food dispensing
48 establishment from the platform of the food delivery service platform provider is subject
49 to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day that the food dispensing establishment
50 remains on the platform after the 10th day after the food delivery service platform
51 provider receives the information.
