5 same-day pickup of such food. (NRS 597.7625-597.7642) Existing law designates a
6 person who operates such a platform as a food delivery service platform provider.
7 (NRS 597.7628) Existing law defines “food dispensing establishment” to mean, in
8 general, a food establishment that prepares and serves food intended for immediate
9 consumption. (NRS 597.7629) Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a
10 person from operating a food establishment unless the person possess a valid permit
11 issued to the person by the health authority. (NRS 446.870)
12 Under existing law, a food delivery service platform provider is prohibited
13 from facilitating an online food order involving a food dispensing establishment,
14 including, without limitation, arranging for the same-day delivery or same-day
15 pickup of food prepared by a food dispensing establishment, unless the food
16 delivery service platform provider has entered into a written agreement with the
17 food dispensing establishment authorizing such activities. (NRS 597.7635)

19 law provides that whenever the performance of any act is prohibited by any statute,
20 and no penalty for the violation of such statute is imposed, a person who commits
21 that act is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 193.151)
22 This bill prohibits a food delivery service platform provider from facilitating an
23 online food order involving a food dispensing establishment unless the operator of
24 the food dispensing establishment has obtained the required permit to operate the
25 food dispensing establishment issued by the health authority. This bill specifically
26 provides that a food delivery service platform provider who violates that
27 prohibition or the prohibition against facilitating an online food order without the

29 law is guilty of a misdemeanor.
