AN ACT relating to child welfare; establishing a form by which a parent or
guardian may request to nominate a guardian of a minor; authorizing
the filing of such a form in the Nevada Lockbox; removing the
authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for
filing a form in the Nevada Lockbox; creating a presumption that
temporary guardianship is in the best interest of a minor in certain
circumstances; [authorizing certain additional persons to receive
supportive assistance through the program to provide such assistance to
certain relatives who provide care for and obtain legal guardianship of
a child; making an appropriation to a program to support pupils
affected by trauma;] and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any person requesting to nominate another person to be appointed
2 as his or her guardian to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian. (NRS 159.0753)
3 Existing law also authorizes the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the Nevada
4 Lockbox, which is an electronic registry where a person may register a form requesting to
5 nominate a guardian, among other documents. (NRS 225.360) Section 1 of this bill authorizes
6 a parent or guardian of a minor who wishes to request to nominate another person to be
7 appointed as the guardian for the minor to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian
8 of the minor. Section 1 clarifies that a person nominated to be a guardian of a minor is
9 required to obtain appointment from a court before exercising the power of a guardian.
10 Section 3 of this bill requires a court to consider a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a
11 minor in determining which person is most suitable to be the guardian for the minor. Section
12 4 of this bill includes a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in the list of
13 documents that may be submitted for inclusion in the Nevada Lockbox. Sections 4.5 and 5.5
14 of this bill remove the authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for
15 the registration of a will or other document in the Nevada Lockbox. Section 5 of this bill
16 authorizes the Secretary of State to provide access to the lockbox when required by a court,

Assembly Amendment No. 206 to Assembly Bill No. 460 Page 4
17 hospital, law enforcement agency or other entity that needs to determine whether a person has
18 designated a guardian for a minor. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
19 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
20 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a petitioner may request the appointment
21 of a temporary guardian for the person or estate, or both, of a proposed protected minor in
22 circumstances where it is not feasible or would be harmful to notify the persons and entities
23 who are normally entitled to notice of a guardianship hearing. Existing law presumes that
24 temporary guardianship is in the best interest of the minor if no parent has had the care,
25 custody and control of the minor for the immediately preceding 6 months. (NRS 159A.053)
26 Section 2 of this bill creates an additional presumption that a temporary guardianship is in the
27 best interest of the proposed protected minor if no parent has the care, custody and control of
28 the minor due to one or both parents being separated from the minor due to a federal
29 immigration order.
30 [Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish and
31 administer a program to provide supportive assistance to qualifying relatives of children who
32 provide care for and obtain the legal guardianship of those children, if the relative meets
33 certain requirements, including, having attained a minimum age set by the Department. (NRS
34 422A.650) Section 6 of this bill authorizes a relative who has not attained that minimum age
35 to receive supportive assistance through the program if the person is the legal guardian of a
36 child who has been separated from one or both parents due to a federal immigration order.
37 Section 8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Education for the
38 Nevada Trauma Recovery Grant Project for supporting pupils affected by trauma through the
39 delivery of clinical trauma-specific interventions.]

13 4. The Secretary of State shall make the form established in subsection 3
14 available on the Internet website of the Secretary of State.
15 5. The person nominated for appointment as the guardian of a minor
16 pursuant to this section must file a petition and obtain an appointment from the
17 court before exercising the powers of a guardian.
18 6. The Secretary of State may adopt any regulations necessary to carry out
19 the provisions of this section.
20 Sec. 2. NRS 159A.053 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 159A.053 1. A petitioner may request that the court appoint a temporary
22 guardian for the person or the estate, or both, of a proposed protected minor by
23 filing a verified petition.
24 2. The petition must state facts which establish good cause for the
25 appointment of a temporary guardian and which show that:
26 (a) The petitioner has tried in good faith to notify the persons entitled to notice
27 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 by telephone or in writing before the filing of the
28 petition;
29 (b) The proposed protected minor would be exposed to an immediate risk of
30 physical, emotional or financial harm if the petitioner were to provide notice to the
31 persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 before the court determines
32 whether to appoint a temporary guardian; or
33 (c) Giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 is
34 not feasible under the circumstances.
35 3. A petition which seeks an ex parte appointment of a temporary guardian
36 must be accompanied by an affidavit which explains the emergency that requires a
37 temporary guardian to be appointed before a hearing.
38 4. If no parent of the proposed protected minor has had the care, custody and
39 control of the minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the petition [,] or one
40 or both parents have been separated from the minor due to a federal immigration
41 order leading to no parent having the care, custody and control of the minor,
42 temporary guardianship of the person of the minor is presumed to be in the best
43 interest of the minor.
44 5. The court may, upon that petition or other showing as it may require,
45 appoint a temporary guardian of the person or the estate, or both, of the proposed
46 protected minor.
47 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, after the appointment of a
48 temporary guardian, the petitioner shall attempt in good faith to notify the persons
49 entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047, including, without limitation, notice
50 of any hearing to extend the temporary guardianship. If the petitioner fails to make
51 such an effort, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
52 7. If, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, the court was satisfied
53 that giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 was

Assembly Amendment No. 206 to Assembly Bill No. 460 Page 7
1 not feasible under the circumstances or determined that such notice was not
2 required pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection 2, the petitioner shall notify
3 the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 without undue delay, but
4 not later than 48 hours after the appointment of the temporary guardian or not later
5 than 48 hours after the petitioner discovers the existence, identity and location of
6 the persons entitled to notice pursuant to that section. If the petitioner fails to
7 provide such notice, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
8 8. Not later than 10 days after the date of an ex parte appointment of a
9 temporary guardian pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall hold a hearing to
10 determine the need to extend the temporary guardianship. Except as otherwise
11 provided in subsection 9, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
12 the protected minor continues to be in need of a temporary guardian, the court may,
13 pursuant to subsection 10, extend the temporary guardianship until a general
14 guardian is appointed.
15 9. The court may not extend a temporary guardianship pursuant to subsection
16 8 beyond the initial period of 10 days unless the petitioner demonstrates that:
17 (a) The provisions of NRS 159A.0475 have been satisfied; or
18 (b) Notice by publication pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure is
19 currently being undertaken.
20 10. The court may extend the temporary guardianship, for good cause shown,
21 for not more than two successive 60-day periods, unless extraordinary
22 circumstances necessitate a longer duration for the temporary guardianship.
23 11. If for any reason a guardian who is appointed for a protected minor cannot
24 perform the duties of a guardian, the court may, upon a petition filed to request
25 temporary guardianship for the minor, appoint a temporary guardian to exercise the
26 powers of a guardian until another guardian is appointed for the minor.
27 Sec. 3. NRS 159A.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 159A.061 1. The parents of a proposed protected minor, or either parent, if
29 qualified and suitable, are preferred over all others for appointment as guardian for
30 the person or estate or person and estate of the proposed protected minor. The
31 appointment of a parent as guardian for the person or estate of a proposed protected
32 minor must not conflict with a valid order for custody of the proposed protected
33 minor.
34 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a parent of a proposed
35 protected minor files a petition seeking appointment as guardian for the proposed
36 protected minor, the parent is presumed to be suitable to serve as guardian for the
37 proposed protected minor.
38 3. In determining whether the parents of a proposed protected minor, or either
39 parent, or any other person who seeks appointment as guardian for the proposed
40 protected minor is qualified and suitable, the court shall consider, if applicable and
41 without limitation:
42 (a) Which parent has physical custody of the proposed protected minor;
43 (b) The ability of the parents, parent or other person to provide for the basic
44 needs of the proposed protected minor, including, without limitation, food, shelter,
45 clothing and medical care, taking into consideration any special needs of the
46 proposed protected minor;
47 (c) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in the habitual use
48 of alcohol or any controlled substance during the previous 6 months, except the use
49 of cannabis in accordance with the provisions of chapter 678C of NRS;
50 (d) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been convicted of a crime
51 of moral turpitude, a crime involving domestic violence or a crime involving the
52 abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of a child, his or her spouse,
53 his or her parent or any other adult;

Assembly Amendment No. 206 to Assembly Bill No. 460 Page 8
1 (e) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been convicted in this State
2 or any other jurisdiction of a felony; and
3 (f) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in one or more acts
4 of domestic violence against the proposed protected minor, a parent of the proposed
5 protected minor or any other person who resides with the proposed protected minor.
6 4. A parent of a proposed protected minor is presumed to be unsuitable to
7 care for the proposed protected minor if:
8 (a) The parent is unable to provide for any or all of the basic needs of the
9 proposed protected minor, including, without limitation:
10 (1) Food;
11 (2) Shelter;
12 (3) Clothing;
13 (4) Medical care; and
14 (5) Education;
15 (b) Because of action or inaction, the parent poses a significant safety risk of
16 either physical or emotional danger to the proposed protected minor; or
17 (c) The proposed protected minor has not been in the care, custody and control
18 of the parent for the 6 months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. The
19 presumption created by this paragraph is a rebuttable presumption.
20 5. Subject to the preference set forth in subsection 1 and except as otherwise
21 provided in subsection 7, the court shall appoint as guardian the qualified person
22 who is most suitable and is willing to serve.
23 6. In determining which qualified person is most suitable, the court shall, in
24 addition to considering any applicable factors set forth in subsections 2, 3 and 4,
25 give consideration, among other factors, to:
26 (a) Any nomination of a guardian for the proposed protected minor contained
27 in a will , a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor that is executed in
28 accordance with section 1 of this act or other written instrument executed by a
29 parent of the proposed protected minor.
30 (b) Any request made by the proposed protected minor, if he or she is 14 years
31 of age or older, for the appointment of a person as guardian for the proposed
32 protected minor.
33 (c) The relationship by blood or adoption of the proposed guardian to the
34 proposed protected minor. In considering preferences of appointment, the court
35 may consider relatives of the half blood equally with those of the whole blood. The
36 court may consider relatives in the following order of preference:
37 (1) Parent.
38 (2) Adult sibling.
39 (3) Grandparent.
40 (4) Uncle or aunt.
41 (d) Any recommendation made by a master of the court or special master
42 pursuant to NRS 159A.0615.
43 (e) Any recommendation made by:
44 (1) An agency which provides child welfare services, an agency which
45 provides child protective services or a similar agency; or
46 (2) A guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate who represents
47 the proposed protected minor.
48 (f) Any request for the appointment of any other interested person that the
49 court deems appropriate.
50 7. The court may award temporary guardianship pursuant to this section,
51 supported by findings of suitability, pending a trial or evidentiary hearing if that
52 appointment is supported by findings.

Assembly Amendment No. 206 to Assembly Bill No. 460 Page 9
1 8. Notwithstanding the presumption set forth in subsection 4, in the event of
2 competing petitions for the appointment of guardianship of a proposed protected
3 minor, any finding of unsuitability of a parent of the proposed protected minor must
4 be found by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing on the merits or an
5 evidentiary hearing.
6 9. In determining whether to appoint a guardian of the person or estate of a
7 proposed protected minor and who should be appointed, the court must always act
8 in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.
9 10. A court shall not refuse to appoint a person as a guardian of the person or
10 estate of a proposed protected minor solely because the person:
11 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or
12 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.
