AN ACT relating to child welfare; establishing a form by which a
parent or guardian may request to nominate a guardian of
a minor; authorizing the filing of such a form in the
Nevada Lockbox; creating a presumption that temporary
guardianship is in the best interest of a minor in certain
circumstances; authorizing certain additional persons to
receive supportive assistance through the program to
provide such assistance to certain relatives who provide
care for and obtain legal guardianship of a child; making
an appropriation to a program to support pupils affected
by trauma; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any person requesting to nominate another person to be
2 appointed as his or her guardian to complete a form requesting to nominate a
3 guardian. (NRS 159.0753) Existing law also authorizes the Secretary of State to
4 establish and maintain the Nevada Lockbox, which is an electronic registry where a
5 person may register a form requesting to nominate a guardian, among other
6 documents. (NRS 225.360) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a parent or guardian of
7 a minor who wishes to request to nominate another person to be appointed as the
8 guardian for the minor to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian of the
9 minor. Section 1 clarifies that a person nominated to be a guardian of a minor is
10 required to obtain appointment from a court before exercising the power of a
11 guardian. Section 3 of this bill requires a court to consider a form requesting to
-
*AB460*

– 2 –
12 nominate a guardian of a minor in determining which person is most suitable to be
13 the guardian for the minor. Section 4 of this bill includes a form requesting to
14 nominate a guardian of a minor in the list of documents that may be submitted for
15 inclusion in the Nevada Lockbox. Section 5 of this bill authorizes the Secretary of
16 State to provide access to the lockbox when required by a court, hospital, law
17 enforcement agency or other entity that needs to determine whether a person has
18 designated a guardian for a minor. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming
19 change to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised
20 Statutes.
21 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a petitioner may request the
22 appointment of a temporary guardian for the person or estate, or both, of a proposed
23 protected minor in circumstances where it is not feasible or would be harmful to
24 notify the persons and entities who are normally entitled to notice of a guardianship
25 hearing. Existing law presumes that temporary guardianship is in the best interest of
26 the minor if no parent has had the care, custody and control of the minor for the
27 immediately preceding 6 months. (NRS 159A.053) Section 2 of this bill creates an
28 additional presumption that a temporary guardianship is in the best interest of the
29 proposed protected minor if no parent has the care, custody and control of the
30 minor due to one or both parents being separated from the minor due to a federal
31 immigration order.
32 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
33 establish and administer a program to provide supportive assistance to qualifying
34 relatives of children who provide care for and obtain the legal guardianship of those
35 children, if the relative meets certain requirements, including, having attained a
36 minimum age set by the Department. (NRS 422A.650) Section 6 of this bill
37 authorizes a relative who has not attained that minimum age to receive supportive
38 assistance through the program if the person is the legal guardian of a child who has
39 been separated from one or both parents due to a federal immigration order.
40 Section 8 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Education
41 for the Nevada Trauma Recovery Grant Project for supporting pupils affected by
42 trauma through the delivery of clinical trauma-specific interventions.

*AB460*

– 5 –
1 5. The person nominated for appointment as the guardian of
2 a minor pursuant to this section must file a petition and obtain an
3 appointment from the court before exercising the powers of a
4 guardian.
5 6. The Secretary of State may adopt any regulations
6 necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.
7 Sec. 2. NRS 159A.053 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 159A.053 1. A petitioner may request that the court appoint a
9 temporary guardian for the person or the estate, or both, of a
10 proposed protected minor by filing a verified petition.
11 2. The petition must state facts which establish good cause for
12 the appointment of a temporary guardian and which show that:
13 (a) The petitioner has tried in good faith to notify the persons
14 entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 by telephone or in
15 writing before the filing of the petition;
16 (b) The proposed protected minor would be exposed to an
17 immediate risk of physical, emotional or financial harm if the
18 petitioner were to provide notice to the persons entitled to notice
19 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 before the court determines whether to
20 appoint a temporary guardian; or
21 (c) Giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to
22 NRS 159A.047 is not feasible under the circumstances.
23 3. A petition which seeks an ex parte appointment of a
24 temporary guardian must be accompanied by an affidavit which
25 explains the emergency that requires a temporary guardian to be
26 appointed before a hearing.
27 4. If no parent of the proposed protected minor has had the
28 care, custody and control of the minor for the 6 months immediately
29 preceding the petition [,] or one or both parents have been
30 separated from the minor due to a federal immigration order
31 leading to no parent having the care, custody and control of the
32 minor, temporary guardianship of the person of the minor is
33 presumed to be in the best interest of the minor.
34 5. The court may, upon that petition or other showing as it may
35 require, appoint a temporary guardian of the person or the estate, or
36 both, of the proposed protected minor.
37 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, after the
38 appointment of a temporary guardian, the petitioner shall attempt in
39 good faith to notify the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS
40 159A.047, including, without limitation, notice of any hearing to
41 extend the temporary guardianship. If the petitioner fails to make
42 such an effort, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
43 7. If, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, the court
44 was satisfied that giving notice to the persons entitled to notice
45 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 was not feasible under the circumstances
-
*AB460*

– 6 –
1 or determined that such notice was not required pursuant to
2 paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection 2, the petitioner shall notify the
3 persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 without undue
4 delay, but not later than 48 hours after the appointment of the
5 temporary guardian or not later than 48 hours after the petitioner
6 discovers the existence, identity and location of the persons entitled
7 to notice pursuant to that section. If the petitioner fails to provide
8 such notice, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
9 8. Not later than 10 days after the date of an ex parte
10 appointment of a temporary guardian pursuant to subsection 5, the
11 court shall hold a hearing to determine the need to extend the
12 temporary guardianship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
13 9, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
14 protected minor continues to be in need of a temporary guardian, the
15 court may, pursuant to subsection 10, extend the temporary
16 guardianship until a general guardian is appointed.
17 9. The court may not extend a temporary guardianship pursuant
18 to subsection 8 beyond the initial period of 10 days unless the
19 petitioner demonstrates that:
20 (a) The provisions of NRS 159A.0475 have been satisfied; or
21 (b) Notice by publication pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil
22 Procedure is currently being undertaken.
23 10. The court may extend the temporary guardianship, for good
24 cause shown, for not more than two successive 60-day periods,
25 unless extraordinary circumstances necessitate a longer duration for
26 the temporary guardianship.
27 11. If for any reason a guardian who is appointed for a
28 protected minor cannot perform the duties of a guardian, the court
29 may, upon a petition filed to request temporary guardianship for the
30 minor, appoint a temporary guardian to exercise the powers of a
31 guardian until another guardian is appointed for the minor.
32 Sec. 3. NRS 159A.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 159A.061 1. The parents of a proposed protected minor, or
34 either parent, if qualified and suitable, are preferred over all others
35 for appointment as guardian for the person or estate or person and
36 estate of the proposed protected minor. The appointment of a parent
37 as guardian for the person or estate of a proposed protected minor
38 must not conflict with a valid order for custody of the proposed
39 protected minor.
40 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a parent of a
41 proposed protected minor files a petition seeking appointment as
42 guardian for the proposed protected minor, the parent is presumed to
43 be suitable to serve as guardian for the proposed protected minor.
44 3. In determining whether the parents of a proposed protected
45 minor, or either parent, or any other person who seeks appointment
-
*AB460*

– 7 –
1 as guardian for the proposed protected minor is qualified and
2 suitable, the court shall consider, if applicable and without
3 limitation:
4 (a) Which parent has physical custody of the proposed protected
5 minor;
6 (b) The ability of the parents, parent or other person to provide
7 for the basic needs of the proposed protected minor, including,
8 without limitation, food, shelter, clothing and medical care, taking
9 into consideration any special needs of the proposed protected
10 minor;
11 (c) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in
12 the habitual use of alcohol or any controlled substance during the
13 previous 6 months, except the use of cannabis in accordance with
14 the provisions of chapter 678C of NRS;
15 (d) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been
16 convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, a crime involving domestic
17 violence or a crime involving the abuse, neglect, exploitation,
18 isolation or abandonment of a child, his or her spouse, his or her
19 parent or any other adult;
20 (e) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been
21 convicted in this State or any other jurisdiction of a felony; and
22 (f) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in
23 one or more acts of domestic violence against the proposed
24 protected minor, a parent of the proposed protected minor or any
25 other person who resides with the proposed protected minor.
26 4. A parent of a proposed protected minor is presumed to be
27 unsuitable to care for the proposed protected minor if:
28 (a) The parent is unable to provide for any or all of the basic
29 needs of the proposed protected minor, including, without
30 limitation:
31 (1) Food;
32 (2) Shelter;
33 (3) Clothing;
34 (4) Medical care; and
35 (5) Education;
36 (b) Because of action or inaction, the parent poses a significant
37 safety risk of either physical or emotional danger to the proposed
38 protected minor; or
39 (c) The proposed protected minor has not been in the care,
40 custody and control of the parent for the 6 months immediately
41 preceding the filing of the petition. The presumption created by this
42 paragraph is a rebuttable presumption.
43 5. Subject to the preference set forth in subsection 1 and except
44 as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the court shall appoint as
-
*AB460*

– 8 –
1 guardian the qualified person who is most suitable and is willing to
2 serve.
3 6. In determining which qualified person is most suitable, the
4 court shall, in addition to considering any applicable factors set forth
5 in subsections 2, 3 and 4, give consideration, among other factors,
6 to:
7 (a) Any nomination of a guardian for the proposed protected
8 minor contained in a will , a form requesting to nominate a
9 guardian of a minor that is executed in accordance with section 1
10 of this act or other written instrument executed by a parent of the
11 proposed protected minor.
12 (b) Any request made by the proposed protected minor, if he or
13 she is 14 years of age or older, for the appointment of a person as
14 guardian for the proposed protected minor.
15 (c) The relationship by blood or adoption of the proposed
16 guardian to the proposed protected minor. In considering
17 preferences of appointment, the court may consider relatives of the
18 half blood equally with those of the whole blood. The court may
19 consider relatives in the following order of preference:
20 (1) Parent.
21 (2) Adult sibling.
22 (3) Grandparent.
23 (4) Uncle or aunt.
24 (d) Any recommendation made by a master of the court or
25 special master pursuant to NRS 159A.0615.
26 (e) Any recommendation made by:
27 (1) An agency which provides child welfare services, an
28 agency which provides child protective services or a similar agency;
29 or
30 (2) A guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate
31 who represents the proposed protected minor.
32 (f) Any request for the appointment of any other interested
33 person that the court deems appropriate.
34 7. The court may award temporary guardianship pursuant to
35 this section, supported by findings of suitability, pending a trial or
36 evidentiary hearing if that appointment is supported by findings.
37 8. Notwithstanding the presumption set forth in subsection 4,
38 in the event of competing petitions for the appointment of
39 guardianship of a proposed protected minor, any finding of
40 unsuitability of a parent of the proposed protected minor must be
41 found by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing on the merits
42 or an evidentiary hearing.
43 9. In determining whether to appoint a guardian of the person
44 or estate of a proposed protected minor and who should be
-
*AB460*

– 9 –
1 appointed, the court must always act in the best interests of the
2 proposed protected minor.
3 10. A court shall not refuse to appoint a person as a guardian of
4 the person or estate of a proposed protected minor solely because
5 the person:
6 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or
7 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.
