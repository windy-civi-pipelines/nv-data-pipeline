Assembly Bill No. 460–Assemblymember González
Joint Sponsor: Senator Doñate
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to child welfare; establishing a form by which a
parent or guardian may request to nominate a guardian of a
minor; authorizing the filing of such a form in the Nevada
Lockbox; removing the authority of the Secretary of State to
charge and collect a fee for filing a form in the Nevada
Lockbox; creating a presumption that temporary guardianship
is in the best interest of a minor in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes any person requesting to nominate another person to be
appointed as his or her guardian to complete a form requesting to nominate a
guardian. (NRS 159.0753) Existing law also authorizes the Secretary of State to
establish and maintain the Nevada Lockbox, which is an electronic registry where a
person may register a form requesting to nominate a guardian, among other
documents. (NRS 225.360) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a parent or guardian of
a minor who wishes to request to nominate another person to be appointed as the
guardian for the minor to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian of the
minor. Section 1 clarifies that a person nominated to be a guardian of a minor is
required to obtain appointment from a court before exercising the power of a
guardian. Section 3 of this bill requires a court to consider a form requesting to
nominate a guardian of a minor in determining which person is most suitable to be
the guardian for the minor. Section 4 of this bill includes a form requesting to
nominate a guardian of a minor in the list of documents that may be submitted for
inclusion in the Nevada Lockbox. Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill remove the
authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for the registration of
a will or other document in the Nevada Lockbox. Section 5 of this bill authorizes
the Secretary of State to provide access to the lockbox when required by a court,
hospital, law enforcement agency or other entity that needs to determine whether a
person has designated a guardian for a minor. Section 7 of this bill makes a
conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada
Revised Statutes.
Existing law establishes a procedure by which a petitioner may request the
appointment of a temporary guardian for the person or estate, or both, of a proposed
protected minor in circumstances where it is not feasible or would be harmful to
notify the persons and entities who are normally entitled to notice of a guardianship
hearing. Existing law presumes that temporary guardianship is in the best interest of
the minor if no parent has had the care, custody and control of the minor for the
immediately preceding 6 months. (NRS 159A.053) Section 2 of this bill creates an
additional presumption that a temporary guardianship is in the best interest of the
proposed protected minor during a period of time in which no parent has the care,
custody and control of the minor due to one or both parents being separated from
the minor due to a federal immigration order.

entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 by telephone or in
writing before the filing of the petition;
(b) The proposed protected minor would be exposed to an

4. [If no parent of the proposed protected minor has had the
care, custody and control of the minor for the 6 months immediately
preceding the petition, temporary] Temporary guardianship of the
person of [the] a proposed protected minor is presumed to be in the
best interest of the minor [.] :
(a) If no parent of the minor has had the care, custody and
control of the minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the
petition; or
(b) During a period of time in which no parent has the care,
custody and control of the minor because one or both parents are
separated from the minor due to a federal immigration order.
5. The court may, upon that petition or other showing as it may
require, appoint a temporary guardian of the person or the estate, or
both, of the proposed protected minor.
6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, after the
appointment of a temporary guardian, the petitioner shall attempt in
good faith to notify the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS
159A.047, including, without limitation, notice of any hearing to

such an effort, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
7. If, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, the court

pursuant to NRS 159A.047 was not feasible under the circumstances
or determined that such notice was not required pursuant to

persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 without undue
delay, but not later than 48 hours after the appointment of the

– 6 –
court may, pursuant to subsection 10, extend the temporary
guardianship until a general guardian is appointed.

(b) Notice by publication pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil
Procedure is currently being undertaken.
10. The court may extend the temporary guardianship, for good
cause shown, for not more than two successive 60-day periods,
unless extraordinary circumstances necessitate a longer duration for
the temporary guardianship.
11. If for any reason a guardian who is appointed for a
protected minor cannot perform the duties of a guardian, the court
may, upon a petition filed to request temporary guardianship for the
minor, appoint a temporary guardian to exercise the powers of a
guardian until another guardian is appointed for the minor.
Sec. 3. NRS 159A.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
159A.061 1. The parents of a proposed protected minor, or
either parent, if qualified and suitable, are preferred over all others
for appointment as guardian for the person or estate or person and
estate of the proposed protected minor. The appointment of a parent
as guardian for the person or estate of a proposed protected minor
must not conflict with a valid order for custody of the proposed
protected minor.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a parent of a
proposed protected minor files a petition seeking appointment as
guardian for the proposed protected minor, the parent is presumed to
be suitable to serve as guardian for the proposed protected minor.
3. In determining whether the parents of a proposed protected
minor, or either parent, or any other person who seeks appointment
as guardian for the proposed protected minor is qualified and
suitable, the court shall consider, if applicable and without
limitation:
(a) Which parent has physical custody of the proposed protected
minor;

for the basic needs of the proposed protected minor, including,
without limitation, food, shelter, clothing and medical care, taking

isolation or abandonment of a child, his or her spouse, his or her
parent or any other adult;
(e) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been
convicted in this State or any other jurisdiction of a felony; and
(f) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in
one or more acts of domestic violence against the proposed
protected minor, a parent of the proposed protected minor or any
other person who resides with the proposed protected minor.
4. A parent of a proposed protected minor is presumed to be

needs of the proposed protected minor, including, without
limitation:
(1) Food;
(2) Shelter;
(3) Clothing;
(4) Medical care; and
(5) Education;
(b) Because of action or inaction, the parent poses a significant
safety risk of either physical or emotional danger to the proposed
protected minor; or

custody and control of the parent for the 6 months immediately

paragraph is a rebuttable presumption.
5. Subject to the preference set forth in subsection 1 and except
as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the court shall appoint as
guardian the qualified person who is most suitable and is willing to
serve.
6. In determining which qualified person is most suitable, the
court shall, in addition to considering any applicable factors set forth
in subsections 2, 3 and 4, give consideration, among other factors,
to:
(a) Any nomination of a guardian for the proposed protected
minor contained in a will , a form requesting to nominate a
guardian of a minor that is executed in accordance with section 1

she is 14 years of age or older, for the appointment of a person as
guardian for the proposed protected minor.
(c) The relationship by blood or adoption of the proposed
guardian to the proposed protected minor. In considering
preferences of appointment, the court may consider relatives of the
half blood equally with those of the whole blood. The court may
consider relatives in the following order of preference:

person that the court deems appropriate.
7. The court may award temporary guardianship pursuant to
this section, supported by findings of suitability, pending a trial or
evidentiary hearing if that appointment is supported by findings.
8. Notwithstanding the presumption set forth in subsection 4,
in the event of competing petitions for the appointment of
guardianship of a proposed protected minor, any finding of
unsuitability of a parent of the proposed protected minor must be
found by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing on the merits

proposed protected minor.
