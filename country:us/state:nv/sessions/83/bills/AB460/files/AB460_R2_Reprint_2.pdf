EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; establishing a form by which a
parent or guardian may request to nominate a guardian of
a minor; authorizing the filing of such a form in the
Nevada Lockbox; removing the authority of the Secretary
of State to charge and collect a fee for filing a form in the
Nevada Lockbox; creating a presumption that temporary
guardianship is in the best interest of a minor in certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any person requesting to nominate another person to be
2 appointed as his or her guardian to complete a form requesting to nominate a
3 guardian. (NRS 159.0753) Existing law also authorizes the Secretary of State to
4 establish and maintain the Nevada Lockbox, which is an electronic registry where a
5 person may register a form requesting to nominate a guardian, among other
6 documents. (NRS 225.360) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a parent or guardian of
7 a minor who wishes to request to nominate another person to be appointed as the
8 guardian for the minor to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian of the
9 minor. Section 1 clarifies that a person nominated to be a guardian of a minor is
10 required to obtain appointment from a court before exercising the power of a
11 guardian. Section 3 of this bill requires a court to consider a form requesting to
12 nominate a guardian of a minor in determining which person is most suitable to be
13 the guardian for the minor. Section 4 of this bill includes a form requesting to
14 nominate a guardian of a minor in the list of documents that may be submitted for
-

– 2 –
15 inclusion in the Nevada Lockbox. Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill remove the
16 authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for the registration of
17 a will or other document in the Nevada Lockbox. Section 5 of this bill authorizes
18 the Secretary of State to provide access to the lockbox when required by a court,
19 hospital, law enforcement agency or other entity that needs to determine whether a
20 person has designated a guardian for a minor. Section 7 of this bill makes a
21 conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada
22 Revised Statutes.
23 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a petitioner may request the
24 appointment of a temporary guardian for the person or estate, or both, of a proposed
25 protected minor in circumstances where it is not feasible or would be harmful to
26 notify the persons and entities who are normally entitled to notice of a guardianship
27 hearing. Existing law presumes that temporary guardianship is in the best interest of
28 the minor if no parent has had the care, custody and control of the minor for the
29 immediately preceding 6 months. (NRS 159A.053) Section 2 of this bill creates an
30 additional presumption that a temporary guardianship is in the best interest of the
31 proposed protected minor during a period of time in which no parent has the care,
32 custody and control of the minor due to one or both parents being separated from
33 the minor due to a federal immigration order.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 159A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:

5 the minor may do so by completing a form requesting to nominate
6 a guardian of a minor in accordance with this section.

8 pursuant to this section must be:
9 (a) Signed by the parent or guardian who is executing the
10 form;
11 (b) Signed by two impartial adult witnesses who have no
12 interest, financial or otherwise, in the estate of the minor or the
13 parent or guardian of the minor and who attest that the parent or
14 guardian has the mental capacity to understand and execute the
15 form; and
16 (c) Notarized.
17 3. A nomination of a guardian of a minor made pursuant to

41 Sec. 2. NRS 159A.053 is hereby amended to read as follows:

43 temporary guardian for the person or the estate, or both, of a
44 proposed protected minor by filing a verified petition.
-
*AB460_R2*

– 5 –
1 2. The petition must state facts which establish good cause for
2 the appointment of a temporary guardian and which show that:
3 (a) The petitioner has tried in good faith to notify the persons
4 entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 by telephone or in
5 writing before the filing of the petition;
6 (b) The proposed protected minor would be exposed to an
7 immediate risk of physical, emotional or financial harm if the
8 petitioner were to provide notice to the persons entitled to notice
9 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 before the court determines whether to
10 appoint a temporary guardian; or
11 (c) Giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to
12 NRS 159A.047 is not feasible under the circumstances.
13 3. A petition which seeks an ex parte appointment of a
14 temporary guardian must be accompanied by an affidavit which
15 explains the emergency that requires a temporary guardian to be
16 appointed before a hearing.
17 4. [If no parent of the proposed protected minor has had the
18 care, custody and control of the minor for the 6 months immediately
19 preceding the petition, temporary] Temporary guardianship of the
20 person of [the] a proposed protected minor is presumed to be in the
21 best interest of the minor [.] :
22 (a) If no parent of the minor has had the care, custody and
23 control of the minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the
24 petition; or
25 (b) During a period of time in which no parent has the care,
26 custody and control of the minor because one or both parents are
27 separated from the minor due to a federal immigration order.
28 5. The court may, upon that petition or other showing as it may
29 require, appoint a temporary guardian of the person or the estate, or
30 both, of the proposed protected minor.
31 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, after the
32 appointment of a temporary guardian, the petitioner shall attempt in
33 good faith to notify the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS
34 159A.047, including, without limitation, notice of any hearing to
35 extend the temporary guardianship. If the petitioner fails to make
36 such an effort, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
37 7. If, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, the court
38 was satisfied that giving notice to the persons entitled to notice
39 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 was not feasible under the circumstances
40 or determined that such notice was not required pursuant to
41 paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection 2, the petitioner shall notify the
42 persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 without undue
43 delay, but not later than 48 hours after the appointment of the

– 6 –
1 to notice pursuant to that section. If the petitioner fails to provide
2 such notice, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.

4 appointment of a temporary guardian pursuant to subsection 5, the
5 court shall hold a hearing to determine the need to extend the
6 temporary guardianship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
7 9, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
8 protected minor continues to be in need of a temporary guardian, the
9 court may, pursuant to subsection 10, extend the temporary
10 guardianship until a general guardian is appointed.
11 9. The court may not extend a temporary guardianship pursuant
12 to subsection 8 beyond the initial period of 10 days unless the
13 petitioner demonstrates that:
14 (a) The provisions of NRS 159A.0475 have been satisfied; or
15 (b) Notice by publication pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil
16 Procedure is currently being undertaken.
17 10. The court may extend the temporary guardianship, for good
18 cause shown, for not more than two successive 60-day periods,
19 unless extraordinary circumstances necessitate a longer duration for
20 the temporary guardianship.
21 11. If for any reason a guardian who is appointed for a
22 protected minor cannot perform the duties of a guardian, the court
23 may, upon a petition filed to request temporary guardianship for the
24 minor, appoint a temporary guardian to exercise the powers of a
25 guardian until another guardian is appointed for the minor.
26 Sec. 3. NRS 159A.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 159A.061 1. The parents of a proposed protected minor, or
28 either parent, if qualified and suitable, are preferred over all others
29 for appointment as guardian for the person or estate or person and
30 estate of the proposed protected minor. The appointment of a parent
31 as guardian for the person or estate of a proposed protected minor
32 must not conflict with a valid order for custody of the proposed
33 protected minor.
34 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a parent of a
35 proposed protected minor files a petition seeking appointment as
36 guardian for the proposed protected minor, the parent is presumed to
37 be suitable to serve as guardian for the proposed protected minor.
38 3. In determining whether the parents of a proposed protected
39 minor, or either parent, or any other person who seeks appointment
40 as guardian for the proposed protected minor is qualified and
41 suitable, the court shall consider, if applicable and without
42 limitation:
43 (a) Which parent has physical custody of the proposed protected
44 minor;
-
*AB460_R2*

– 7 –
1 (b) The ability of the parents, parent or other person to provide
2 for the basic needs of the proposed protected minor, including,

5 minor;
6 (c) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in
7 the habitual use of alcohol or any controlled substance during the
8 previous 6 months, except the use of cannabis in accordance with
9 the provisions of chapter 678C of NRS;
10 (d) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been
11 convicted of a crime of moral turpitude, a crime involving domestic
12 violence or a crime involving the abuse, neglect, exploitation,
13 isolation or abandonment of a child, his or her spouse, his or her
14 parent or any other adult;
15 (e) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been
16 convicted in this State or any other jurisdiction of a felony; and
17 (f) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in
18 one or more acts of domestic violence against the proposed
19 protected minor, a parent of the proposed protected minor or any
20 other person who resides with the proposed protected minor.
21 4. A parent of a proposed protected minor is presumed to be
22 unsuitable to care for the proposed protected minor if:
23 (a) The parent is unable to provide for any or all of the basic
24 needs of the proposed protected minor, including, without
25 limitation:
26 (1) Food;
27 (2) Shelter;
28 (3) Clothing;
29 (4) Medical care; and

32 safety risk of either physical or emotional danger to the proposed
33 protected minor; or
34 (c) The proposed protected minor has not been in the care,
35 custody and control of the parent for the 6 months immediately
36 preceding the filing of the petition. The presumption created by this
37 paragraph is a rebuttable presumption.
38 5. Subject to the preference set forth in subsection 1 and except
39 as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the court shall appoint as
40 guardian the qualified person who is most suitable and is willing to
41 serve.
42 6. In determining which qualified person is most suitable, the
43 court shall, in addition to considering any applicable factors set forth
44 in subsections 2, 3 and 4, give consideration, among other factors,
45 to:
-
*AB460_R2*

2 minor contained in a will , a form requesting to nominate a

5 proposed protected minor.

7 she is 14 years of age or older, for the appointment of a person as
8 guardian for the proposed protected minor.
9 (c) The relationship by blood or adoption of the proposed
10 guardian to the proposed protected minor. In considering

31 8. Notwithstanding the presumption set forth in subsection 4,
32 in the event of competing petitions for the appointment of
33 guardianship of a proposed protected minor, any finding of
34 unsuitability of a parent of the proposed protected minor must be
35 found by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing on the merits
36 or an evidentiary hearing.
37 9. In determining whether to appoint a guardian of the person
38 or estate of a proposed protected minor and who should be
39 appointed, the court must always act in the best interests of the
40 proposed protected minor.
41 10. A court shall not refuse to appoint a person as a guardian of
