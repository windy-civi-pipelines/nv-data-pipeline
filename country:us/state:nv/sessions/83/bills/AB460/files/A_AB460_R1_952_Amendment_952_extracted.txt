EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; establishing a form by which a parent or
guardian may request to nominate a guardian of a minor; authorizing
the filing of such a form in the Nevada Lockbox; removing the
authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for filing
a form in the Nevada Lockbox; creating a presumption that temporary
guardianship is in the best interest of a minor in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any person requesting to nominate another person to be appointed
2 as his or her guardian to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian. (NRS 159.0753)
3 Existing law also authorizes the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the Nevada
4 Lockbox, which is an electronic registry where a person may register a form requesting to
5 nominate a guardian, among other documents. (NRS 225.360) Section 1 of this bill authorizes
6 a parent or guardian of a minor who wishes to request to nominate another person to be
7 appointed as the guardian for the minor to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian
8 of the minor. Section 1 clarifies that a person nominated to be a guardian of a minor is
9 required to obtain appointment from a court before exercising the power of a guardian.
10 Section 3 of this bill requires a court to consider a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a
11 minor in determining which person is most suitable to be the guardian for the minor. Section
12 4 of this bill includes a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in the list of
13 documents that may be submitted for inclusion in the Nevada Lockbox. Sections 4.5 and 5.5
14 of this bill remove the authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for the
15 registration of a will or other document in the Nevada Lockbox. Section 5 of this bill
16 authorizes the Secretary of State to provide access to the lockbox when required by a court,
17 hospital, law enforcement agency or other entity that needs to determine whether a person has
18 designated a guardian for a minor. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
19 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
20 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a petitioner may request the appointment
21 of a temporary guardian for the person or estate, or both, of a proposed protected minor in
22 circumstances where it is not feasible or would be harmful to notify the persons and entities
Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 4
23 who are normally entitled to notice of a guardianship hearing. Existing law presumes that
24 temporary guardianship is in the best interest of the minor if no parent has had the care,
25 custody and control of the minor for the immediately preceding 6 months. (NRS 159A.053)
26 Section 2 of this bill creates an additional presumption that a temporary guardianship is in the
27 best interest of the proposed protected minor [if] during a period of time in which no parent
28 has the care, custody and control of the minor due to one or both parents being separated from
29 the minor due to a federal immigration order.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 159A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:

5 completing a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in accordance

8 section must be:
9 (a) Signed by the parent or guardian who is executing the form;

11 otherwise, in the estate of the minor or the parent or guardian of the minor and
12 who attest that the parent or guardian has the mental capacity to understand and
13 execute the form; and
14 (c) Notarized.
15 3. A nomination of a guardian of a minor made pursuant to this section
16 may be in substantially the following form, and must be witnessed and executed

Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 6
1 6. The Secretary of State may adopt any regulations necessary to carry out
2 the provisions of this section.
3 Sec. 2. NRS 159A.053 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 159A.053 1. A petitioner may request that the court appoint a temporary
5 guardian for the person or the estate, or both, of a proposed protected minor by
6 filing a verified petition.
7 2. The petition must state facts which establish good cause for the
8 appointment of a temporary guardian and which show that:
9 (a) The petitioner has tried in good faith to notify the persons entitled to notice
10 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 by telephone or in writing before the filing of the
11 petition;
12 (b) The proposed protected minor would be exposed to an immediate risk of
13 physical, emotional or financial harm if the petitioner were to provide notice to the
14 persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 before the court determines
15 whether to appoint a temporary guardian; or
16 (c) Giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 is
17 not feasible under the circumstances.
18 3. A petition which seeks an ex parte appointment of a temporary guardian
19 must be accompanied by an affidavit which explains the emergency that requires a
20 temporary guardian to be appointed before a hearing.
21 4. [If no parent of the proposed protected minor has had the care, custody and
22 control of the minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the petition , or one or
23 both parents have been separated from the minor due to a federal immigration
24 order leading to no parent having the care, custody and control of the minor,
25 temporary] Temporary guardianship of the person of [the] a proposed protected
26 minor is presumed to be in the best interest of the minor [.] :
27 (a) If no parent of the minor has had the care, custody and control of the
28 minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the petition; or
29 (b) During a period of time in which no parent has the care, custody and
30 control of the minor because one or both parents are separated from the minor
31 due to a federal immigration order.
32 5. The court may, upon that petition or other showing as it may require,
33 appoint a temporary guardian of the person or the estate, or both, of the proposed
34 protected minor.
35 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, after the appointment of a
36 temporary guardian, the petitioner shall attempt in good faith to notify the persons
37 entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047, including, without limitation, notice
38 of any hearing to extend the temporary guardianship. If the petitioner fails to make
39 such an effort, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
40 7. If, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, the court was satisfied
41 that giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 was
42 not feasible under the circumstances or determined that such notice was not
43 required pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection 2, the petitioner shall notify
44 the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 without undue delay, but
45 not later than 48 hours after the appointment of the temporary guardian or not later
46 than 48 hours after the petitioner discovers the existence, identity and location of
47 the persons entitled to notice pursuant to that section. If the petitioner fails to
48 provide such notice, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
49 8. Not later than 10 days after the date of an ex parte appointment of a
50 temporary guardian pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall hold a hearing to
51 determine the need to extend the temporary guardianship. Except as otherwise
52 provided in subsection 9, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
53 the protected minor continues to be in need of a temporary guardian, the court may,
Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 7
1 pursuant to subsection 10, extend the temporary guardianship until a general
2 guardian is appointed.
3 9. The court may not extend a temporary guardianship pursuant to subsection
4 8 beyond the initial period of 10 days unless the petitioner demonstrates that:
5 (a) The provisions of NRS 159A.0475 have been satisfied; or
6 (b) Notice by publication pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure is
7 currently being undertaken.
8 10. The court may extend the temporary guardianship, for good cause shown,
9 for not more than two successive 60-day periods, unless extraordinary
10 circumstances necessitate a longer duration for the temporary guardianship.
11 11. If for any reason a guardian who is appointed for a protected minor cannot
12 perform the duties of a guardian, the court may, upon a petition filed to request
13 temporary guardianship for the minor, appoint a temporary guardian to exercise the
14 powers of a guardian until another guardian is appointed for the minor.
15 Sec. 3. NRS 159A.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 159A.061 1. The parents of a proposed protected minor, or either parent, if
17 qualified and suitable, are preferred over all others for appointment as guardian for
18 the person or estate or person and estate of the proposed protected minor. The
19 appointment of a parent as guardian for the person or estate of a proposed protected
20 minor must not conflict with a valid order for custody of the proposed protected
21 minor.
22 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a parent of a proposed
23 protected minor files a petition seeking appointment as guardian for the proposed
24 protected minor, the parent is presumed to be suitable to serve as guardian for the
25 proposed protected minor.
26 3. In determining whether the parents of a proposed protected minor, or either
27 parent, or any other person who seeks appointment as guardian for the proposed
28 protected minor is qualified and suitable, the court shall consider, if applicable and
29 without limitation:
30 (a) Which parent has physical custody of the proposed protected minor;
31 (b) The ability of the parents, parent or other person to provide for the basic
32 needs of the proposed protected minor, including, without limitation, food, shelter,
33 clothing and medical care, taking into consideration any special needs of the
34 proposed protected minor;
35 (c) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in the habitual use
36 of alcohol or any controlled substance during the previous 6 months, except the use
37 of cannabis in accordance with the provisions of chapter 678C of NRS;
38 (d) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been convicted of a crime
39 of moral turpitude, a crime involving domestic violence or a crime involving the
40 abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of a child, his or her spouse,
41 his or her parent or any other adult;
42 (e) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been convicted in this State
43 or any other jurisdiction of a felony; and
44 (f) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in one or more acts
45 of domestic violence against the proposed protected minor, a parent of the proposed
46 protected minor or any other person who resides with the proposed protected minor.
47 4. A parent of a proposed protected minor is presumed to be unsuitable to
48 care for the proposed protected minor if:
49 (a) The parent is unable to provide for any or all of the basic needs of the
50 proposed protected minor, including, without limitation:
51 (1) Food;
52 (2) Shelter;
53 (3) Clothing;
Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 8
1 (4) Medical care; and
2 (5) Education;
3 (b) Because of action or inaction, the parent poses a significant safety risk of
4 either physical or emotional danger to the proposed protected minor; or
5 (c) The proposed protected minor has not been in the care, custody and control
6 of the parent for the 6 months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. The
7 presumption created by this paragraph is a rebuttable presumption.
8 5. Subject to the preference set forth in subsection 1 and except as otherwise
9 provided in subsection 7, the court shall appoint as guardian the qualified person
10 who is most suitable and is willing to serve.
11 6. In determining which qualified person is most suitable, the court shall, in
12 addition to considering any applicable factors set forth in subsections 2, 3 and 4,
13 give consideration, among other factors, to:
14 (a) Any nomination of a guardian for the proposed protected minor contained
15 in a will , a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor that is executed in
16 accordance with section 1 of this act or other written instrument executed by a
17 parent of the proposed protected minor.
18 (b) Any request made by the proposed protected minor, if he or she is 14 years
19 of age or older, for the appointment of a person as guardian for the proposed
20 protected minor.
21 (c) The relationship by blood or adoption of the proposed guardian to the
22 proposed protected minor. In considering preferences of appointment, the court
23 may consider relatives of the half blood equally with those of the whole blood. The
24 court may consider relatives in the following order of preference:
25 (1) Parent.
26 (2) Adult sibling.
27 (3) Grandparent.
28 (4) Uncle or aunt.
29 (d) Any recommendation made by a master of the court or special master
30 pursuant to NRS 159A.0615.
31 (e) Any recommendation made by:
32 (1) An agency which provides child welfare services, an agency which
33 provides child protective services or a similar agency; or
34 (2) A guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate who represents
35 the proposed protected minor.
36 (f) Any request for the appointment of any other interested person that the
37 court deems appropriate.
38 7. The court may award temporary guardianship pursuant to this section,
39 supported by findings of suitability, pending a trial or evidentiary hearing if that
40 appointment is supported by findings.
41 8. Notwithstanding the presumption set forth in subsection 4, in the event of
42 competing petitions for the appointment of guardianship of a proposed protected
43 minor, any finding of unsuitability of a parent of the proposed protected minor must
44 be found by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing on the merits or an
45 evidentiary hearing.
46 9. In determining whether to appoint a guardian of the person or estate of a
47 proposed protected minor and who should be appointed, the court must always act
48 in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.
49 10. A court shall not refuse to appoint a person as a guardian of the person or
50 estate of a proposed protected minor solely because the person:
51 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or
52 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to child welfare. (BDR 13-1060)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included in
Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; establishing a form by which a parent or
guardian may request to nominate a guardian of a minor; authorizing
the filing of such a form in the Nevada Lockbox; removing the
authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for filing
a form in the Nevada Lockbox; creating a presumption that temporary
guardianship is in the best interest of a minor in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any person requesting to nominate another person to be appointed
2 as his or her guardian to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian. (NRS 159.0753)
3 Existing law also authorizes the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the Nevada
4 Lockbox, which is an electronic registry where a person may register a form requesting to
5 nominate a guardian, among other documents. (NRS 225.360) Section 1 of this bill authorizes
6 a parent or guardian of a minor who wishes to request to nominate another person to be
7 appointed as the guardian for the minor to complete a form requesting to nominate a guardian
8 of the minor. Section 1 clarifies that a person nominated to be a guardian of a minor is
9 required to obtain appointment from a court before exercising the power of a guardian.
10 Section 3 of this bill requires a court to consider a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a
11 minor in determining which person is most suitable to be the guardian for the minor. Section
12 4 of this bill includes a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in the list of
13 documents that may be submitted for inclusion in the Nevada Lockbox. Sections 4.5 and 5.5
14 of this bill remove the authority of the Secretary of State to charge and collect a fee for the
15 registration of a will or other document in the Nevada Lockbox. Section 5 of this bill
16 authorizes the Secretary of State to provide access to the lockbox when required by a court,
17 hospital, law enforcement agency or other entity that needs to determine whether a person has
18 designated a guardian for a minor. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
19 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
20 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a petitioner may request the appointment
21 of a temporary guardian for the person or estate, or both, of a proposed protected minor in
22 circumstances where it is not feasible or would be harmful to notify the persons and entities

Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 4
23 who are normally entitled to notice of a guardianship hearing. Existing law presumes that
24 temporary guardianship is in the best interest of the minor if no parent has had the care,
25 custody and control of the minor for the immediately preceding 6 months. (NRS 159A.053)
26 Section 2 of this bill creates an additional presumption that a temporary guardianship is in the
27 best interest of the proposed protected minor [if] during a period of time in which no parent
28 has the care, custody and control of the minor due to one or both parents being separated from
29 the minor due to a federal immigration order.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 159A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Any parent or guardian of a minor who wishes to request to nominate
4 another person to be appointed as the guardian for the minor may do so by
5 completing a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor in accordance
6 with this section.
7 2. A form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor pursuant to this
8 section must be:
9 (a) Signed by the parent or guardian who is executing the form;
10 (b) Signed by two impartial adult witnesses who have no interest, financial or
11 otherwise, in the estate of the minor or the parent or guardian of the minor and
12 who attest that the parent or guardian has the mental capacity to understand and
13 execute the form; and
14 (c) Notarized.
15 3. A nomination of a guardian of a minor made pursuant to this section
16 may be in substantially the following form, and must be witnessed and executed
17 in the same manner as the following form:

Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 6
1 6. The Secretary of State may adopt any regulations necessary to carry out
2 the provisions of this section.
3 Sec. 2. NRS 159A.053 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 159A.053 1. A petitioner may request that the court appoint a temporary
5 guardian for the person or the estate, or both, of a proposed protected minor by
6 filing a verified petition.
7 2. The petition must state facts which establish good cause for the
8 appointment of a temporary guardian and which show that:
9 (a) The petitioner has tried in good faith to notify the persons entitled to notice
10 pursuant to NRS 159A.047 by telephone or in writing before the filing of the
11 petition;
12 (b) The proposed protected minor would be exposed to an immediate risk of
13 physical, emotional or financial harm if the petitioner were to provide notice to the
14 persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 before the court determines
15 whether to appoint a temporary guardian; or
16 (c) Giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 is
17 not feasible under the circumstances.
18 3. A petition which seeks an ex parte appointment of a temporary guardian
19 must be accompanied by an affidavit which explains the emergency that requires a
20 temporary guardian to be appointed before a hearing.
21 4. [If no parent of the proposed protected minor has had the care, custody and
22 control of the minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the petition , or one or
23 both parents have been separated from the minor due to a federal immigration
24 order leading to no parent having the care, custody and control of the minor,
25 temporary] Temporary guardianship of the person of [the] a proposed protected
26 minor is presumed to be in the best interest of the minor [.] :
27 (a) If no parent of the minor has had the care, custody and control of the
28 minor for the 6 months immediately preceding the petition; or
29 (b) During a period of time in which no parent has the care, custody and
30 control of the minor because one or both parents are separated from the minor
31 due to a federal immigration order.
32 5. The court may, upon that petition or other showing as it may require,
33 appoint a temporary guardian of the person or the estate, or both, of the proposed
34 protected minor.
35 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, after the appointment of a
36 temporary guardian, the petitioner shall attempt in good faith to notify the persons
37 entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047, including, without limitation, notice
38 of any hearing to extend the temporary guardianship. If the petitioner fails to make
39 such an effort, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
40 7. If, before the appointment of a temporary guardian, the court was satisfied
41 that giving notice to the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 was
42 not feasible under the circumstances or determined that such notice was not
43 required pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection 2, the petitioner shall notify
44 the persons entitled to notice pursuant to NRS 159A.047 without undue delay, but
45 not later than 48 hours after the appointment of the temporary guardian or not later
46 than 48 hours after the petitioner discovers the existence, identity and location of
47 the persons entitled to notice pursuant to that section. If the petitioner fails to
48 provide such notice, the court may terminate the temporary guardianship.
49 8. Not later than 10 days after the date of an ex parte appointment of a
50 temporary guardian pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall hold a hearing to
51 determine the need to extend the temporary guardianship. Except as otherwise
52 provided in subsection 9, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
53 the protected minor continues to be in need of a temporary guardian, the court may,

Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 7
1 pursuant to subsection 10, extend the temporary guardianship until a general
2 guardian is appointed.
3 9. The court may not extend a temporary guardianship pursuant to subsection
4 8 beyond the initial period of 10 days unless the petitioner demonstrates that:
5 (a) The provisions of NRS 159A.0475 have been satisfied; or
6 (b) Notice by publication pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure is
7 currently being undertaken.
8 10. The court may extend the temporary guardianship, for good cause shown,
9 for not more than two successive 60-day periods, unless extraordinary
10 circumstances necessitate a longer duration for the temporary guardianship.
11 11. If for any reason a guardian who is appointed for a protected minor cannot
12 perform the duties of a guardian, the court may, upon a petition filed to request
13 temporary guardianship for the minor, appoint a temporary guardian to exercise the
14 powers of a guardian until another guardian is appointed for the minor.
15 Sec. 3. NRS 159A.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 159A.061 1. The parents of a proposed protected minor, or either parent, if
17 qualified and suitable, are preferred over all others for appointment as guardian for
18 the person or estate or person and estate of the proposed protected minor. The
19 appointment of a parent as guardian for the person or estate of a proposed protected
20 minor must not conflict with a valid order for custody of the proposed protected
21 minor.
22 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a parent of a proposed
23 protected minor files a petition seeking appointment as guardian for the proposed
24 protected minor, the parent is presumed to be suitable to serve as guardian for the
25 proposed protected minor.
26 3. In determining whether the parents of a proposed protected minor, or either
27 parent, or any other person who seeks appointment as guardian for the proposed
28 protected minor is qualified and suitable, the court shall consider, if applicable and
29 without limitation:
30 (a) Which parent has physical custody of the proposed protected minor;
31 (b) The ability of the parents, parent or other person to provide for the basic
32 needs of the proposed protected minor, including, without limitation, food, shelter,
33 clothing and medical care, taking into consideration any special needs of the
34 proposed protected minor;
35 (c) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in the habitual use
36 of alcohol or any controlled substance during the previous 6 months, except the use
37 of cannabis in accordance with the provisions of chapter 678C of NRS;
38 (d) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been convicted of a crime
39 of moral turpitude, a crime involving domestic violence or a crime involving the
40 abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of a child, his or her spouse,
41 his or her parent or any other adult;
42 (e) Whether the parents, parent or other person has been convicted in this State
43 or any other jurisdiction of a felony; and
44 (f) Whether the parents, parent or other person has engaged in one or more acts
45 of domestic violence against the proposed protected minor, a parent of the proposed
46 protected minor or any other person who resides with the proposed protected minor.
47 4. A parent of a proposed protected minor is presumed to be unsuitable to
48 care for the proposed protected minor if:
49 (a) The parent is unable to provide for any or all of the basic needs of the
50 proposed protected minor, including, without limitation:
51 (1) Food;
52 (2) Shelter;
53 (3) Clothing;

Senate Amendment No. 952 to Assembly Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 8
1 (4) Medical care; and
2 (5) Education;
3 (b) Because of action or inaction, the parent poses a significant safety risk of
4 either physical or emotional danger to the proposed protected minor; or
5 (c) The proposed protected minor has not been in the care, custody and control
6 of the parent for the 6 months immediately preceding the filing of the petition. The
7 presumption created by this paragraph is a rebuttable presumption.
8 5. Subject to the preference set forth in subsection 1 and except as otherwise
9 provided in subsection 7, the court shall appoint as guardian the qualified person
10 who is most suitable and is willing to serve.
11 6. In determining which qualified person is most suitable, the court shall, in
12 addition to considering any applicable factors set forth in subsections 2, 3 and 4,
13 give consideration, among other factors, to:
14 (a) Any nomination of a guardian for the proposed protected minor contained
15 in a will , a form requesting to nominate a guardian of a minor that is executed in
16 accordance with section 1 of this act or other written instrument executed by a
17 parent of the proposed protected minor.
18 (b) Any request made by the proposed protected minor, if he or she is 14 years
19 of age or older, for the appointment of a person as guardian for the proposed
20 protected minor.
21 (c) The relationship by blood or adoption of the proposed guardian to the
22 proposed protected minor. In considering preferences of appointment, the court
23 may consider relatives of the half blood equally with those of the whole blood. The
24 court may consider relatives in the following order of preference:
25 (1) Parent.
26 (2) Adult sibling.
27 (3) Grandparent.
28 (4) Uncle or aunt.
29 (d) Any recommendation made by a master of the court or special master
30 pursuant to NRS 159A.0615.
31 (e) Any recommendation made by:
32 (1) An agency which provides child welfare services, an agency which
33 provides child protective services or a similar agency; or
34 (2) A guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate who represents
35 the proposed protected minor.
36 (f) Any request for the appointment of any other interested person that the
37 court deems appropriate.
38 7. The court may award temporary guardianship pursuant to this section,
39 supported by findings of suitability, pending a trial or evidentiary hearing if that
40 appointment is supported by findings.
41 8. Notwithstanding the presumption set forth in subsection 4, in the event of
42 competing petitions for the appointment of guardianship of a proposed protected
43 minor, any finding of unsuitability of a parent of the proposed protected minor must
44 be found by clear and convincing evidence after a hearing on the merits or an
45 evidentiary hearing.
46 9. In determining whether to appoint a guardian of the person or estate of a
47 proposed protected minor and who should be appointed, the court must always act
48 in the best interests of the proposed protected minor.
49 10. A court shall not refuse to appoint a person as a guardian of the person or
50 estate of a proposed protected minor solely because the person:
51 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or
52 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.
53 11. As used in this section:
