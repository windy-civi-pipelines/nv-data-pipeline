SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to enact
veterans to receive an amount equal to the military retirement
pay of the veteran after the veteran’s death.
WHEREAS, Certain veterans who serve in the Armed Forces of
the United States for a period of at least 20 years or who qualify to
retire medically are eligible to receive military retirement pay for
their military service; and
WHEREAS, Military retirement pay, however, terminates upon
the death of the veteran, so many veterans enroll in the Survivor
Benefit Plan, which was enacted by Congress in 1972 and which
provides a monetary benefit in the form of a lifetime annuity to the
surviving spouse or other beneficiary of the veteran upon the
veteran’s death; and
WHEREAS, A portion of the cost of this annuity is paid from
reductions to the veteran’s retirement pay, and the maximum
survivor benefit is 55 percent of the retirement pay of the veteran at
the time of the veteran’s death; and
WHEREAS, The spouses of veterans hold unique and important
roles in upholding the strength of the United States as they provide
crucial support to their veteran spouses during the veteran’s military
service and retirement; and
WHEREAS, Allowing an eligible spouse who opted to receive the
surviving spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan to
receive an amount equal to the retirement pay of the veteran after
the veteran’s death recognizes the many sacrifices that a military
spouse also makes in service of this country, including delaying or
relinquishing personal and professional aspirations; now, therefore,
be it
RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd Session of the
Nevada Legislature hereby urge Congress to enact legislation
allowing an eligible spouse who opted to receive the surviving
spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan to receive an
amount equal to the retirement pay of the veteran after the veteran’s
death; and be it further
