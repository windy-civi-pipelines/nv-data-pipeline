SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to enact legislation allowing
certain eligible surviving spouses of veterans to receive an amount
equal to the military retirement pay of the veteran after the veteran’s
death.
1 WHEREAS, Certain veterans who serve in the Armed Forces of the United
2 States for a period of at least 20 years or who qualify to retire medically are eligible
3 to receive military retirement pay for their military service; and
4 WHEREAS, Military retirement pay, however, terminates upon the death of the
5 veteran, so many veterans enroll in the Survivor Benefit Plan, which was enacted
6 by Congress in 1972 and which provides a monetary benefit in the form of a
7 lifetime annuity to the surviving spouse or other beneficiary of the veteran upon the
8 veteran’s death; and
9 WHEREAS, A portion of the cost of this annuity is paid from reductions to the
10 veteran’s retirement pay, and the maximum survivor benefit is 55 percent of the
11 retirement pay of the veteran at the time of the veteran’s death; and
12 WHEREAS, The spouses of veterans hold unique and important roles in
13 upholding the strength of the United States as they provide crucial support to their
14 veteran spouses during the veteran’s military service and retirement; and
15 WHEREAS, Allowing an eligible spouse who opted to receive the surviving
16 spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan to receive an amount equal to the
17 retirement pay of the veteran after the veteran’s death recognizes the many
18 sacrifices that a military spouse also makes in service of this country, including
19 delaying or relinquishing personal and professional aspirations; now, therefore, be
20 it
