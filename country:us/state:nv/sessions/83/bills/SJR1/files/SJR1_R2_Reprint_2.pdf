SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to enact
legislation allowing certain eligible surviving spouses of
veterans to receive an amount equal to the military
retirement pay of the veteran after the veteran’s death.
1 WHEREAS, Certain veterans who serve in the Armed Forces of
2 the United States for a period of at least 20 years or who qualify to
3 retire medically are eligible to receive military retirement pay for
4 their military service; and
5 WHEREAS, Military retirement pay, however, terminates upon
6 the death of the veteran, so many veterans enroll in the Survivor
7 Benefit Plan, which was enacted by Congress in 1972 and which
8 provides a monetary benefit in the form of a lifetime annuity to the
9 surviving spouse or other beneficiary of the veteran upon the
10 veteran’s death; and
11 WHEREAS, A portion of the cost of this annuity is paid from
12 reductions to the veteran’s retirement pay, and the maximum
13 survivor benefit is 55 percent of the retirement pay of the veteran at
14 the time of the veteran’s death; and

1 WHEREAS, The spouses of veterans hold unique and important
2 roles in upholding the strength of the United States as they provide
3 crucial support to their veteran spouses during the veteran’s military
4 service and retirement; and
5 WHEREAS, Allowing an eligible spouse who opted to receive the
6 surviving spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan to
7 receive an amount equal to the retirement pay of the veteran after
8 the veteran’s death recognizes the many sacrifices that a military
9 spouse also makes in service of this country, including delaying or
10 relinquishing personal and professional aspirations; now, therefore,
11 be it
12 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
13 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd Session of the
14 Nevada Legislature hereby urge Congress to enact legislation
15 allowing an eligible spouse who opted to receive the surviving
16 spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan to receive an
17 amount equal to the retirement pay of the veteran after the veteran’s
18 death; and be it further
19 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and
20 transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of the United
21 States as the presiding officer of the United States Senate, the
22 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each
23 member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
24 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
25 passage.
