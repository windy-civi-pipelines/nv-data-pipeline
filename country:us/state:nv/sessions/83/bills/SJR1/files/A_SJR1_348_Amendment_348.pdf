SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to enact legislation allowing
[the] certain eligible surviving [spouse] spouses of [a veteran]
veterans to receive an amount equal to the military retirement pay of
the veteran after the veteran’s death.
1 WHEREAS, Certain veterans who serve in the Armed Forces of the United
2 States for a period of at least 20 years or who qualify to retire medically are eligible
3 to receive military retirement pay for their military service; and
4 WHEREAS, Military retirement pay, however, terminates upon the death of the
5 veteran [; and
6 WHEREAS, The cessation of military retirement pay may leave the surviving
7 spouse of a veteran in a dire financial situation shortly after the death of the
8 veteran; and] , so many veterans enroll in the Survivor Benefit Plan, which was
9 enacted by Congress in 1972 and which provides a monetary benefit in the
10 form of a lifetime annuity to the surviving spouse or other beneficiary of the
11 veteran upon the veteran’s death; and
12 WHEREAS, A portion of the cost of this annuity is paid from reductions to
13 the veteran’s retirement pay, and the maximum survivor benefit is 55 percent
14 of the retirement pay of the veteran at the time of the veteran’s death; and
15 WHEREAS, The spouses of veterans hold unique and important roles in
16 upholding the strength of the United States as they provide crucial support to their
17 veteran spouses during the veteran’s military service and retirement; and
18 WHEREAS, Allowing [the surviving] an eligible spouse who opted to receive
19 the surviving spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan to receive an
20 amount equal to the retirement pay of [a] the veteran [to receive the veteran’s
21 military retirement pay] after the veteran’s death recognizes the many sacrifices
22 that a military spouse also makes in service of this country, including delaying or
23 relinquishing personal and professional aspirations; now, therefore, be it
24 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
25 That the members of the 83rd Session of the Nevada Legislature hereby urge

Senate Amendment No. 348 to Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 Page 4
1 Congress to enact legislation allowing [the surviving] an eligible spouse who
2 opted to receive the surviving spouse benefit through the Survivor Benefit Plan
3 to receive an amount equal to the retirement pay of [a] the veteran [to receive
4 the military retirement pay of the veteran] after the veteran’s death; and be it further
5 RESOLVED, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and transmit a copy of this
6 resolution to the Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer of the
7 United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives
8 and each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
9 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage.
