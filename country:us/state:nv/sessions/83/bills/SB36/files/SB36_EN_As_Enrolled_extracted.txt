Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire
certain groundwater rights; creating the Nevada Conservation
and Recreation Program; creating the Account for Retiring
Water Rights; establishing the Nevada Voluntary Water
Rights Retirement Program; requiring the Director of the
State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to
purchase certain water rights for the purpose of retiring the
water rights; revising provisions governing a program to
provide grants of money for certain purposes relating to
improvements to water systems and to conserve water; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of
this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the
Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and
requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or
certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10.7 of this bill
establishes the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director and
establishes requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or
certificated groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of decreed or
certificated groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also prohibits the Director from
accepting donations or applications for the purchase and retirement of such
groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes conforming
changes to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or donations after
this date.

Section 2:
Section 8 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
certificated groundwater rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary
Water Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from
retiring any groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation
of the groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.

Section 3:
Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
Program.
Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
22) Section 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10.3 further
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. Section 12 of this bill
provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies
the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of

Section 4:
sections 10.3-10.7.
Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements
to water systems and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients
may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
(NRS 349.981) Section 14 of this bill includes the permanent retirement of
groundwater rights for certain purposes in the types of improvements for which an
eligible recipient could receive a grant.
Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program
to provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water
Projects that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be
based upon the average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS

Section 5:
349.983) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a
recipient to be based upon the median household income of the customers of the
recipient.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 36–Committee on Natural Resources
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire
certain groundwater rights; creating the Nevada Conservation
and Recreation Program; creating the Account for Retiring
Water Rights; establishing the Nevada Voluntary Water
Rights Retirement Program; requiring the Director of the
State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to
purchase certain water rights for the purpose of retiring the
water rights; revising provisions governing a program to
provide grants of money for certain purposes relating to
improvements to water systems and to conserve water; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of
this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the
Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and
requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or
certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10.7 of this bill
establishes the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director and
establishes requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or
certificated groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of decreed or
certificated groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also prohibits the Director from
accepting donations or applications for the purchase and retirement of such
groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes conforming
changes to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or donations after
this date.
Section 8 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
certificated groundwater rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary
Water Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from
retiring any groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation
of the groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
Program.
Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
22) Section 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10.3 further
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. Section 12 of this bill
provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies
the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of
sections 10.3-10.7.
Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements
to water systems and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients
may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
(NRS 349.981) Section 14 of this bill includes the permanent retirement of
groundwater rights for certain purposes in the types of improvements for which an
eligible recipient could receive a grant.
Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program
to provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water
Projects that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be
based upon the average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS
349.983) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a
recipient to be based upon the median household income of the customers of the
recipient.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

. [, the State Engineer shall reject the application and refuse to issue
the requested permit.]
 If a previous application for a similar use of water within the
same basin has been rejected on those grounds, the new application
may be denied without publication.
3. In addition to the criteria set forth in subsections 1 and 2, in
determining whether an application for an interbasin transfer of
groundwater must be rejected pursuant to this section, the State
Engineer shall consider:
(a) Whether the applicant has justified the need to import the
water from another basin;
(b) If the State Engineer determines that a plan for conservation
of water is advisable for the basin into which the water is to be
imported, whether the applicant has demonstrated that such a plan
has been adopted and is being effectively carried out;

relates to the basin from which the water is exported;
(d) Whether the proposed action is an appropriate long-term use
which will not unduly limit the future growth and development in
the basin from which the water is exported; and
(e) Any other factor the State Engineer determines to be
relevant.
4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
subsections 6 and 10 and NRS 533.365, the State Engineer shall

accordance with subsections 4 and 6, the application remains active
until approved or rejected by the State Engineer.
6. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
subsection 10, the State Engineer shall approve or reject, within 6
months after the final date for filing a protest, an application filed to
change the point of diversion of water already appropriated when
the existing and proposed points of diversion are on the same
property for which the water has already been appropriated under
the existing water right or the proposed point of diversion is on real
property that is proven to be owned by the applicant and is
contiguous to the place of use of the existing water right. The State
Engineer may postpone action on the application pursuant to
subsection 4.
7. If the State Engineer has not approved, rejected or held a
hearing on an application within 7 years after the final date for filing
a protest, the State Engineer shall cause notice of the application to
be republished and reposted pursuant to NRS 533.360 immediately
preceding the time at which the State Engineer is ready to approve
or reject the application. The cost of the republication must be paid
by the applicant. After such republication and reposting, a protest
may be filed in accordance with NRS 533.365.
8. If a hearing is held regarding an application, the decision of
the State Engineer must be in writing and include findings of fact,
conclusions of law and a statement of the underlying facts
supporting the findings of fact. The written decision may take the
form of a transcription of an oral ruling. The rejection or approval of
an application must be endorsed on a copy of the original
application, and a record must be made of the endorsement in the
records of the State Engineer. The copy of the application so
endorsed must be returned to the applicant. Except as otherwise
provided in subsection 11, if the application is approved, the
applicant may, on receipt thereof, proceed with the construction of
the necessary works and take all steps required to apply the water to
beneficial use and to perfect the proposed appropriation. If the
application is rejected, the applicant may take no steps toward the

right or an owner of real property upon which a domestic well is
located and if the former owner of the water right or real property on
which a domestic well is located had previously filed a written
protest against the granting of an application, the successor in
interest must be allowed to pursue that protest in the same manner

he or she succeeded. If the successor in interest wishes to pursue the
protest, the successor in interest must notify the State Engineer in a
timely manner on a form provided by the State Engineer.

ascribed to it in NRS 534.350.
Sec. 3. NRS 533.371 is hereby amended to read as follows:
