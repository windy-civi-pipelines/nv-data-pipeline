AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire certain
groundwater rights; creating the Nevada Conservation and Recreation
Program; creating the Account for Retiring Water Rights; establishing
the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program; requiring the
Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources to purchase certain water rights for the purpose of retiring
the water rights; revising provisions governing a program to provide
grants of money for certain purposes relating to improvements to water
systems and to conserve water; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to change the
2 place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already appropriated, must apply to
3 the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325) Existing law further provides that all
4 underground waters within the boundaries of the State are subject to appropriation for
5 beneficial use only under the laws of this State relating to the appropriation and use of water.
6 (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be
7 administered by the Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,
8 and requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or
9 certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10.7 of this bill establishes the
10 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation and
11 Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director and establishes requirements for: (1)
12 the purchase and retirement of [water] decreed or certificated groundwater rights; and (2)
13 the acceptance of donations of decreed or certificated groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also
14 prohibits the Director from accepting donations or applications for the purchase and
15 retirement of such groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes
16 conforming changes to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or donations after
17 this date.
18 Section 8 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or certificated
19 groundwater rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights
20 Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any groundwater rights

Senate Amendment No. 728 to Senate Bill No. 36 First Reprint Page 4
21 from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the groundwater right was approved by
22 the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
23 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights have been
24 retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program.
25 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local governments,
26 water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain nonprofit organizations to
27 protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property and natural and cultural resources of
28 this State and requires the Director to adopt regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of
29 Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing
30 regulations establish the Nevada Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants.
31 (LCB File No. R025-22) Section 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10.3
32 further provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
33 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. Section 12 of this bill provides that the
34 Program is within the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies the definitions in existing
35 law relating to the Department to the provisions of sections 10.3-10.7.
36 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of water and
37 eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements to water systems
38 and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients may receive grants of money
39 to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water. (NRS 349.981) Section 14 of this bill
40 includes the permanent retirement of groundwater rights for certain purposes in the types of
41 improvements for which an eligible recipient could receive a grant.
42 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to provide
43 an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects that will be used
44 for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the average household
45 income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section 15 of this bill instead
46 requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be based upon the median household
47 income of the customers of the recipient.
