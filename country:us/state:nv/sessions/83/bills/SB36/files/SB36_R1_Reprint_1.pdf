AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire
certain groundwater rights; creating the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program; creating the
Account for Retiring Water Rights; establishing the
Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program;
requiring the Director of the State Department of
Conservation and Natural Resources to purchase certain
water rights for the purpose of retiring the water rights;
revising provisions governing a program to provide grants
of money for certain purposes relating to improvements to
water systems and to conserve water; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
2 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
3 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
4 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
5 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
6 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of
7 this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the
8 Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and
9 requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of
10 groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10.7 of this bill establishes the
11 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada Conservation
12 and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director and establishes
13 requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of water rights; and (2) the
-
*SB36_R1*

– 2 –
14 acceptance of donations of groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also prohibits the
15 Director from accepting donations or applications for the purchase and retirement
16 of such groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes
17 conforming changes to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or
18 donations after this date.
19 Section 8 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all groundwater
20 rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
21 Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any groundwater rights
22 from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the groundwater right was
23 approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
24 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
25 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
26 Program.
27 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
28 governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
29 nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
30 and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
31 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
32 Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada
33 Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
34 22) Section 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10.3 further
35 provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
36 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. Section 12 of this bill
37 provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies
38 the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of
39 sections 10.3-10.7.
40 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
41 water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements
42 to water systems and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients
43 may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
44 (NRS 349.981) Section 14 of this bill includes the permanent retirement of
45 groundwater rights for certain purposes in the types of improvements for which an
46 eligible recipient could receive a grant.
47 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program
48 to provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water
49 Projects that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be
50 based upon the average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS
51 349.983) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a
52 recipient to be based upon the median household income of the customers of the
53 recipient.
