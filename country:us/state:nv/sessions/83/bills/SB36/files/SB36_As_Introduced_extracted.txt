AN ACT relating to water; establishing the Nevada Water Buy-
Back Initiative and the Advisory Committee for the
Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative; requiring the Director
of the State Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources to purchase certain water rights for the purpose
of retiring the water rights; creating the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
2 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
3 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
4 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
5 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
6 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 6 of
7 this bill establishes the Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative in the Nevada
8 Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director of the
9 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and establishes
10 requirements for the purchase and retirement of water rights.
11 Section 8 of this bill requires the State Engineer to retire water rights purchased
12 by the Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative.
13 Section 7 of this bill establishes the Advisory Committee for the Nevada Water
14 Buy-Back Initiative within the Department and requires the Advisory Committee to
15 consult with the Director regarding the provisions of sections 6-9 of this bill.
16 Section 9 requires the Director to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the
17 provisions of sections 6-9. Section 13 of this bill requires the Director to adopt
-

– 2 –
18 such regulations by July 1, 2027. Section 5 of this bill defines certain terms relating
19 to the provisions of sections 6-9.
20 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
21 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative.
22 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
23 governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
24 nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
25 and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
26 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
27 Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations create the Nevada
28 Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
29 22) Section 10 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10 further
30 provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
31 Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative. Section 12 of this bill provides that the
32 Program and the Advisory Committee are within the Department. Section 11 of this
33 bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the
34 provisions of section 10.

13 hearing on an application within 7 years after the final date for filing
14 a protest, the State Engineer shall cause notice of the application to

Conservation and Recreation Program; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
2 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
3 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
4 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
5 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
6 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 6 of
7 this bill establishes the Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative in the Nevada
8 Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director of the
9 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and establishes
10 requirements for the purchase and retirement of water rights.
11 Section 8 of this bill requires the State Engineer to retire water rights purchased
12 by the Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative.
13 Section 7 of this bill establishes the Advisory Committee for the Nevada Water
14 Buy-Back Initiative within the Department and requires the Advisory Committee to
15 consult with the Director regarding the provisions of sections 6-9 of this bill.
16 Section 9 requires the Director to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the
17 provisions of sections 6-9. Section 13 of this bill requires the Director to adopt
-
*SB36*

– 2 –
18 such regulations by July 1, 2027. Section 5 of this bill defines certain terms relating
19 to the provisions of sections 6-9.
20 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
21 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative.
22 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
23 governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
24 nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
25 and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
26 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
27 Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations create the Nevada
28 Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
29 22) Section 10 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10 further
30 provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
31 Nevada Water Buy-Back Initiative. Section 12 of this bill provides that the
32 Program and the Advisory Committee are within the Department. Section 11 of this
33 bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the
34 provisions of section 10.

7 Engineer shall consider:
8 (a) Whether the applicant has justified the need to import the

13 hearing on an application within 7 years after the final date for filing
14 a protest, the State Engineer shall cause notice of the application to

16 preceding the time at which the State Engineer is ready to approve
