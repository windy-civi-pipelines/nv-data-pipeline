AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire
certain groundwater rights; creating the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program; creating the
Account for Retiring Water Rights; establishing the
Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program;
requiring the Director of the State Department of
Conservation and Natural Resources to purchase certain
water rights for the purpose of retiring the water rights;
revising provisions governing a program to provide grants
of money for certain purposes relating to improvements to
water systems and to conserve water; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
2 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
3 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
4 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
5 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
6 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of
7 this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the
8 Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and
9 requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or
10 certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10.7 of this bill
11 establishes the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada
12 Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director and
13 establishes requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or
-
*SB36_R2*
– 2 –
14 certificated groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of decreed or
15 certificated groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also prohibits the Director from
16 accepting donations or applications for the purchase and retirement of such
17 groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes conforming
18 changes to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or donations after
19 this date.
20 Section 8 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
21 certificated groundwater rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary
22 Water Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from
23 retiring any groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation
24 of the groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
25 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
26 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
27 Program.
28 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
29 governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
30 nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
31 and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
32 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
33 Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada
34 Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
35 22) Section 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10.3 further
36 provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
37 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. Section 12 of this bill
38 provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies
39 the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of
40 sections 10.3-10.7.
41 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
42 water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements
43 to water systems and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients
44 may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
45 (NRS 349.981) Section 14 of this bill includes the permanent retirement of
46 groundwater rights for certain purposes in the types of improvements for which an
47 eligible recipient could receive a grant.
48 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program
49 to provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water
50 Projects that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be
51 based upon the average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS
52 349.983) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a
53 recipient to be based upon the median household income of the customers of the
54 recipient.

SECOND REPRINT S.B. 36
SENATE BILL NO. 36–COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 15, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Natural Resources
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to water. (BDR 48-384)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire
certain groundwater rights; creating the Nevada
Conservation and Recreation Program; creating the
Account for Retiring Water Rights; establishing the
Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program;
requiring the Director of the State Department of
Conservation and Natural Resources to purchase certain
water rights for the purpose of retiring the water rights;
revising provisions governing a program to provide grants
of money for certain purposes relating to improvements to
water systems and to conserve water; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
2 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
3 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
4 Existing law further provides that all underground waters within the boundaries of
5 the State are subject to appropriation for beneficial use only under the laws of this
6 State relating to the appropriation and use of water. (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of
7 this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to be administered by the
8 Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and
9 requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of decreed or
10 certificated groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section 10.7 of this bill
11 establishes the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada
12 Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director and
13 establishes requirements for: (1) the purchase and retirement of decreed or
-
*SB36_R2*

– 2 –
14 certificated groundwater rights; and (2) the acceptance of donations of decreed or
15 certificated groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also prohibits the Director from
16 accepting donations or applications for the purchase and retirement of such
17 groundwater rights after June 30, 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes conforming
18 changes to reflect that the Director may not accept applications or donations after
19 this date.
20 Section 8 of this bill: (1) requires the State Engineer to retire all decreed or
21 certificated groundwater rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary
22 Water Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from
23 retiring any groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation
24 of the groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
25 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights
26 have been retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement
27 Program.
28 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local
29 governments, water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain
30 nonprofit organizations to protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property
31 and natural and cultural resources of this State and requires the Director to adopt
32 regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480,
33 Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing regulations establish the Nevada
34 Conservation and Recreation Program to make such grants. (LCB File No. R025-
35 22) Section 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute. Section 10.3 further
36 provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such grants and the
37 Nevada Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program. Section 12 of this bill
38 provides that the Program is within the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies
39 the definitions in existing law relating to the Department to the provisions of
40 sections 10.3-10.7.
41 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of
42 water and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements
43 to water systems and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients
44 may receive grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water.
45 (NRS 349.981) Section 14 of this bill includes the permanent retirement of
46 groundwater rights for certain purposes in the types of improvements for which an
47 eligible recipient could receive a grant.
48 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program
49 to provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water
50 Projects that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be
51 based upon the average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS
52 349.983) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a
53 recipient to be based upon the median household income of the customers of the
54 recipient.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 533.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:

35 submitted in proper form which contemplates the application of
36 water to beneficial use if:
37 (a) The application is accompanied by the prescribed fees;
38 (b) The proposed use or change, if within an irrigation district,
39 does not adversely affect the cost of water for other holders of water
40 rights in the district or lessen the efficiency of the district in its
41 delivery or use of water; and
42 (c) The applicant provides proof satisfactory to the State
43 Engineer of the applicant’s:

– 4 –
1 (1) Intention in good faith to construct any work necessary to
2 apply the water to the intended beneficial use with reasonable
3 diligence; and
4 (2) Financial ability and reasonable expectation actually to
5 construct the work and apply the water to the intended beneficial use
6 with reasonable diligence.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 10, [where there]
8 the State Engineer shall reject an application and refuse to issue
9 the requested permit if:
10 (a) There is no unappropriated water in the proposed source of
11 supply [, where the] ;
12 (b) The groundwater that has not been committed for use has
13 been reserved pursuant to NRS 533.0241 ;
14 (c) The application requests a change to or reinstatement of

24 may be denied without publication.
25 3. In addition to the criteria set forth in subsections 1 and 2, in
26 determining whether an application for an interbasin transfer of
27 groundwater must be rejected pursuant to this section, the State
28 Engineer shall consider:
29 (a) Whether the applicant has justified the need to import the
30 water from another basin;
31 (b) If the State Engineer determines that a plan for conservation
32 of water is advisable for the basin into which the water is to be
33 imported, whether the applicant has demonstrated that such a plan
34 has been adopted and is being effectively carried out;
35 (c) Whether the proposed action is environmentally sound as it
36 relates to the basin from which the water is exported;
37 (d) Whether the proposed action is an appropriate long-term use

41 relevant.
42 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and
