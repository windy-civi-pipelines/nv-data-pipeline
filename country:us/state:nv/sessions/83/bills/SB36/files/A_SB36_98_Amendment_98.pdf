AN ACT relating to water; requiring the State Engineer to retire certain
groundwater rights; creating the Nevada Conservation and
Recreation Program; creating the Account for Retiring Water
Rights; establishing the Nevada Voluntary Water [Buy-Back
Initiative and the Advisory Committee for the Nevada Water Buy-Back
Initiative;] Rights Retirement Program; requiring the Director of the
State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to purchase
certain water rights for the purpose of retiring the water rights;
[creating the Nevada Conservation and Recreation Program;] revising
provisions governing a program to provide grants of money for
certain purposes relating to improvements to water systems and to
conserve water; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to change the
2 place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already appropriated, must apply to
3 the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325) Existing law further provides that all
4 underground waters within the boundaries of the State are subject to appropriation for
5 beneficial use only under the laws of this State relating to the appropriation and use of water.
6 (NRS 534.020) Section 10.5 of this bill creates the Account for Retiring Water Rights, to
7 be administered by the Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural
8 Resources, and requires that the money in the Account only be used for the purchase of
9 groundwater rights for certain purposes. Section [6] 10.7 of this bill establishes the
10 Nevada Voluntary Water [Buy-Back Initiative] Rights Retirement Program in the Nevada
11 Conservation and Recreation Program, to be administered by the Director [of the State
12 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources,] and establishes requirements for : (1)
13 the purchase and retirement of water rights [.] ; and (2) the acceptance of donations of
14 groundwater rights. Section 10.7 also prohibits the Director from accepting donations or
15 applications for the purchase and retirement of such groundwater rights after June 30,

Senate Amendment No. 98 to Senate Bill No. 36 Page 4
16 2035. Section 16 of this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that the Director may
17 not accept applications or donations after this date.
18 Section 8 of this bill : (1) requires the State Engineer to retire [water] all groundwater
19 rights purchased by or donated to the Nevada Voluntary Water [Buy-Back Initiative.
20 Section 7 of this bill establishes the Advisory Committee for the Nevada Water Buy-Back
21 Initiative within the Department and requires the Advisory Committee to consult with the
22 Director regarding the provisions of sections 6-9 of this bill.
23 Section 9 requires the Director to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions
24 of sections 6-9. Section 13 of this bill requires the Director to adopt such regulations by July
25 1, 2027. Section 5 of this bill defines certain terms relating to the provisions of sections 6-9.]
26 Rights Retirement Program; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from retiring any
27 groundwater rights from the Program unless the purchase or donation of the
28 groundwater right was approved by the Director on or before June 30, 2035.
29 Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water for which rights have been
30 retired pursuant to the Nevada Voluntary Water [Buy-Back Initiative.] Rights Retirement
31 Program.
32 Existing law requires the Department to make grants to state agencies, local governments,
33 water conservancy districts, conservation districts and certain nonprofit organizations to
34 protect, preserve and obtain the benefits of the property and natural and cultural resources of
35 this State and requires the Director to adopt regulations to make such grants. (Section 2 of
36 Assembly Bill No. 84, chapter 480, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2861) Existing
37 regulations [create] establish the Nevada Conservation and Recreation Program to make such
38 grants. (LCB File No. R025-22) Section [10] 10.3 of this bill creates the Program in statute.
39 Section [10] 10.3 further provides that the Program consists of a grant program to make such
40 grants and the Nevada Voluntary Water [Buy-Back Initiative.] Rights Retirement Program.
41 Section 12 of this bill provides that the Program [and the Advisory Committee are] is within
42 the Department. Section 11 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
43 Department to the provisions of [section 10.] sections 10.3-10.7.
44 Existing law establishes a program to provide grants of money to purveyors of water
45 and eligible recipients to pay for certain costs related to capital improvements to water
46 systems and water conservation. Under this program, eligible recipients may receive
47 grants of money to pay the cost of improvements to conserve water. (NRS 349.981)
48 Section 14 of this bill includes the permanent retirement of groundwater rights for
49 certain purposes in the types of improvements for which an eligible recipient could
50 receive a grant.
51 Existing law requires certain recipients of a grant of money from this program to
52 provide an amount of money determined by the Board for Financing Water Projects
53 that will be used for the same purpose as the grant and which must be based upon the
54 average household income of the customers of the recipient. (NRS 349.983) Section 15 of
55 this bill instead requires the amount of money provided by a recipient to be based upon
56 the median household income of the customers of the recipient.
