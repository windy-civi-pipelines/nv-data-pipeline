EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to install and use a
school bus infraction detection system on school buses to enforce
certain provisions of law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic
enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the location in which such
school buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the school
bus infraction detection system before a civil infraction citation is
issued; establishing requirements relating to the issuance of a civil
infraction citation based on evidence detected by a school bus
infraction detection system; [creating a rebuttable presumption that the
driver of a vehicle at the time of a violation recorded by a school bus
infraction detection system is the registered owner of the vehicle;]
establishes certain requirements for a hearing relating to a civil
infraction citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus
infraction detection system; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using photographic, video
2 or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation or civil infraction
3 citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording device worn or held
4 by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3)
5 privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill
6 create an exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
7 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses
8 owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law prohibiting a driver of any
9 vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which: (1) has stopped to receive or discharge
10 any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing red light signal visible from the front and rear.
11 (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with
Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 4
12 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to
13 review the evidence of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction
14 citation is issued. Section 2 further [creates a rebuttable presumption that the driver of the
15 vehicle at the time of a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is the
16 registered owner of the vehicle and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.] : (1)
17 requires a school district that has not previously installed and used a school bus
18 infraction detection system to conduct a public awareness campaign for not less than 30
19 days after the system is placed into use; (2) establishes certain requirements for a
20 hearing for a citation issued pursuant to section 2; (3) applies an existing fine structure
21 to a citation issued pursuant to section 2; (4) requires a school district to use any fines
22 collected pursuant to section 2 for certain purposes; and (5) requires each school district
23 that installs such a system to prepare and submit an annual report to the Legislature
24 relating to the school bus infraction detection system. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide
25 that a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic
26 violation.
27 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
28 detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment of demerit points;
29 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by a school
30 bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means conviction of a
3 moving traffic violation in any municipal court, justice court or district court in this
4 State or a finding by any municipal court or justice court in this State that a person
5 has committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive.
6 The term includes a finding by a juvenile court that a child has violated a traffic law
7 or ordinance other than one governing standing or parking. The term does not
8 include [a] :
9 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of the speed
10 limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances described in subsection 1
11 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
12 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus infraction
13 detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
14 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
15 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
16 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons
17 deemed to have future driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system
18 must be based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12 months.
19 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the Department shall set
20 up a schedule of demerits for each traffic violation, depending upon the gravity of
21 the violation, on a scale of one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law
22 to eight demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law governing
23 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
24 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
25 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
26 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
27 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or finding is
28 obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated system of demerits within
29 each category of violations according to the extent to which the traffic law was
30 violated.
Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 5
1 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the installation and
4 use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses owned by the
5 school district to enforce the provisions of NRS 484B.353.
6 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes the installation
7 and use of a school bus infraction detection system [shall] :
8 (a) May enter into a contractual agreement with a third party vendor to
9 install and administer such a school bus infraction detection system; and
10 (b) Shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement agency with
11 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with a school bus
12 infraction detection system operates to review the evidence of any alleged
13 infraction of NRS 484B.353 recorded by the school bus infraction detection
14 system.
15 3. If a school district has not previously installed and used a school bus
16 infraction detection system the school district shall, for not less than 30 days after
17 a school bus infraction detection system is placed into use by the school district:
18 (a) Conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the use of school bus
19 infraction detection systems within the school district; and
20 (b) Notify the public of the specific date on which a violation detected by the
21 school bus infraction detection system will become enforceable.
22 4. If, during the period the public awareness campaign described in
23 subsection 3 is conducted, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
24 determines from evidence recorded by a school bus infraction detection system
25 that a person has violated NRS 484B.353, the peace officer may issue only a
26 warning.
27 5. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus infraction
28 detection system, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency determines that
29 a violation of NRS 484B.353 occurred in a location over which the traffic
30 enforcement agency has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil
31 infraction citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation to be
32 sent by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee by first class mail to the
33 address listed with the Department for the registered owner of the vehicle
34 identified by the school bus infraction detection system. A manual or automated
35 record prepared by the law enforcement agency or its designee evidencing that
36 the citation was mailed is prima facie evidence of service and shall be admissible
37 in any hearing as to the facts contained in the civil infraction citation.
38 [4.] 6. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of NRS
39 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a
40 violation described in subsection [3] 5 must include:
41 (a) The date and time of the violation;
42 (b) [An image taken] A photograph or other recorded image produced by the
43 school bus infraction detection system , or the address of the Internet website on
44 which such an image may be viewed, showing [the] :
45 (1) The vehicle involved in the violation ; [or the address of the Internet
46 website on which such an image may be viewed; and]
47 (2) If a stop arm was installed on the school bus, that the stop arm was
48 extended at the time of the violation; and
49 (3) An electronic indicator evidencing that the flashing red light signals
50 of the bus were activated at the time of the violation; and
51 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection [5.
52 5.] 8.
Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 6
1 7. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection system shall
2 not record images of the occupants of a motor vehicle at the time in which the
3 images are recorded by the system. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to
4 this section may not be dismissed because a recorded video or digital image
5 includes images of the occupants of the motor vehicle.
6 8. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the driver of the
7 vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353 which was recorded by a
8 school bus infraction detection system. This presumption may be rebutted if the
9 registered owner of the vehicle submits an affidavit to the traffic enforcement
10 agency or its designee or presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
11 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating [:] under penalty of perjury:
12 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody and control of
13 the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
14 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
15 9. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph (b) of
16 subsection [5] 8 must contain evidence that supports the affidavit, including,
17 without limitation, a police report or an insurance report.
18 [6.] 10. Photographs or other recorded images produced by a school bus
19 infraction detection system shall be deemed prima facie evidence of a violation of
20 NRS 484B.353 and are admissible at any hearing for a citation issued for a
21 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to this
22 section without further authentication. In any hearing for a citation issued for a
23 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system, there is a
24 rebuttable presumption that:
25 (a) At the time in which a violation of NRS 484B.353 was detected by a
26 school bus infraction detection system, the school bus was marked and equipped
27 with signs and signals as required by law; and
28 (b) Where recorded images from a school bus infraction detection system
29 show the activation of a stop arm or flashing red light signals, the school bus was
30 stopped to receive or discharge a pupil and was displaying a flashing red light
31 signal visible from the front and rear of the school bus.
32 [7.] 11. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace officer from
33 issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of this State for which evidence
34 is recorded by a school bus infraction detection system if the peace officer
35 personally witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
36 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil infraction
37 citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus infraction detection system
38 for the same violation for which the peace officer issued the person the traffic
39 citation.
40 [8.] 12. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a hearing on a civil
41 infraction citation issued pursuant to this section shall be conducted in
42 accordance with NRS 484A.7041.
43 13. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction citation is
44 issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection [3:] 5:
45 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
46 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by the local
47 authority, but not less than [$50.
48 9.] the fine imposed pursuant to NRS 484B.353.
49 14. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all administrative fines
50 assessed and collected for a violation of NRS 484B.353 through the use of a
51 school bus infraction detection system must be collected and remitted to the
52 school district in which the violation occurred. The school district shall use the
53 fines collected by this section to:
Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 7
1 (a) Install, maintain or operate the school bus infraction detection systems
2 on school buses;
3 (b) Compensate a third party vendor to install, operate or maintain the
4 school bus infraction detection systems on school buses;
5 (c) Support any other infrastructure or program that increases the safety of
6 transportation services for students; or
7 (d) Pay costs associated with the enforcement of violations detected by a
8 school bus infraction detection system.
9 15. On or before January 31 of each year, each school district which uses a
10 school bus infraction detection system shall prepare and submit a report to the
11 Legislature for the immediately preceding year which includes, without
12 limitation:
13 (a) The number of citations issued through the use of school bus infraction
14 detection systems;
15 (b) The total amount of revenue collected as a result of such citations; and
16 (c) Any data related to the effectiveness of the use of school bus infraction
17 detection systems in reducing the number of violations of NRS 434B.353.
18 16. As used in this section, “school bus infraction detection system” means
19 [a stationary] an electronic or digital system which [creates] produces a
20 photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle which is used as evidence of a
21 violation of NRS 484B.353 by the driver of the vehicle.
22 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of this act, a
24 governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use photographic, video or
25 digital equipment for gathering evidence to be used for the issuance of a traffic
26 citation or civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of
27 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
28 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer, the equipment is
29 otherwise installed temporarily or permanently within a vehicle or facility of a law
30 enforcement agency or the equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental
31 entity.
32 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.700 [,] or
34 section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer makes an arrest or issues a citation
35 to a person for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the
36 police officer shall record the name as given by that person, the number of the
37 person’s driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
38 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for offenses kept at
39 the traffic enforcement agency which employs that officer.
40 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle for any
41 violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and requests information
42 from a traffic enforcement agency concerning that person’s record of prior offenses,
43 the police officer shall compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of
44 his or her driver’s license and physical description with any information obtained
45 from the agency as a result of the request. If the information received from the
46 agency indicates that the driver’s name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior
47 offense, the officer shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the
48 additional information used for comparison also connects the driver with that prior
49 offense.
50 Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.703 is hereby amended to read as follows:
51 484A.703 1. [Every] Except for a citation issued for a violation detected
52 by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act, every
53 traffic enforcement agency in this State shall provide in appropriate form civil
Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 8

8 issued to individual members of the traffic enforcement agency. The chief
9 administrative officer shall require and retain a receipt for every book and
10 electronic device that is issued.
11 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction citation pursuant to

25 citation, the person must respond by requesting in person, by mail or through the
26 Internet or other electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
27 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing, but the date of the
28 hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days after the court provides notice of

SUMMARY—Authorizes the installation and use of school bus infraction detection
systems on school buses. (BDR 43-421)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to install and use a
school bus infraction detection system on school buses to enforce
certain provisions of law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic
enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the location in which such
school buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the school
bus infraction detection system before a civil infraction citation is
issued; establishing requirements relating to the issuance of a civil
infraction citation based on evidence detected by a school bus
infraction detection system; [creating a rebuttable presumption that the
driver of a vehicle at the time of a violation recorded by a school bus
infraction detection system is the registered owner of the vehicle;]
establishes certain requirements for a hearing relating to a civil
infraction citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus
infraction detection system; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using photographic, video
2 or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation or civil infraction
3 citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording device worn or held
4 by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3)
5 privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill
6 create an exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
7 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses
8 owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law prohibiting a driver of any
9 vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which: (1) has stopped to receive or discharge
10 any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing red light signal visible from the front and rear.
11 (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with

Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 4
12 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to
13 review the evidence of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction
14 citation is issued. Section 2 further [creates a rebuttable presumption that the driver of the
15 vehicle at the time of a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is the
16 registered owner of the vehicle and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.] : (1)
17 requires a school district that has not previously installed and used a school bus
18 infraction detection system to conduct a public awareness campaign for not less than 30
19 days after the system is placed into use; (2) establishes certain requirements for a
20 hearing for a citation issued pursuant to section 2; (3) applies an existing fine structure
21 to a citation issued pursuant to section 2; (4) requires a school district to use any fines
22 collected pursuant to section 2 for certain purposes; and (5) requires each school district
23 that installs such a system to prepare and submit an annual report to the Legislature
24 relating to the school bus infraction detection system. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide
25 that a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic
26 violation.
27 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
28 detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment of demerit points;
29 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by a school
30 bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means conviction of a
3 moving traffic violation in any municipal court, justice court or district court in this
4 State or a finding by any municipal court or justice court in this State that a person
5 has committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive.
6 The term includes a finding by a juvenile court that a child has violated a traffic law
7 or ordinance other than one governing standing or parking. The term does not
8 include [a] :
9 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of the speed
10 limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances described in subsection 1
11 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
12 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus infraction
13 detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
14 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
15 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
16 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons
17 deemed to have future driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system
18 must be based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12 months.
19 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the Department shall set
20 up a schedule of demerits for each traffic violation, depending upon the gravity of
21 the violation, on a scale of one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law
22 to eight demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law governing
23 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
24 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
25 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
26 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
27 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or finding is
28 obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated system of demerits within
29 each category of violations according to the extent to which the traffic law was
30 violated.

Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 5
1 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the installation and
4 use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses owned by the
5 school district to enforce the provisions of NRS 484B.353.
6 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes the installation
7 and use of a school bus infraction detection system [shall] :
8 (a) May enter into a contractual agreement with a third party vendor to
9 install and administer such a school bus infraction detection system; and
10 (b) Shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement agency with
11 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with a school bus
12 infraction detection system operates to review the evidence of any alleged
13 infraction of NRS 484B.353 recorded by the school bus infraction detection
14 system.
15 3. If a school district has not previously installed and used a school bus
16 infraction detection system the school district shall, for not less than 30 days after
17 a school bus infraction detection system is placed into use by the school district:
18 (a) Conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the use of school bus
19 infraction detection systems within the school district; and
20 (b) Notify the public of the specific date on which a violation detected by the
21 school bus infraction detection system will become enforceable.
22 4. If, during the period the public awareness campaign described in
23 subsection 3 is conducted, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
24 determines from evidence recorded by a school bus infraction detection system
25 that a person has violated NRS 484B.353, the peace officer may issue only a
26 warning.
27 5. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus infraction
28 detection system, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency determines that
29 a violation of NRS 484B.353 occurred in a location over which the traffic
30 enforcement agency has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil
31 infraction citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation to be
32 sent by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee by first class mail to the
33 address listed with the Department for the registered owner of the vehicle
34 identified by the school bus infraction detection system. A manual or automated
35 record prepared by the law enforcement agency or its designee evidencing that
36 the citation was mailed is prima facie evidence of service and shall be admissible
37 in any hearing as to the facts contained in the civil infraction citation.
38 [4.] 6. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of NRS
39 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a
40 violation described in subsection [3] 5 must include:
41 (a) The date and time of the violation;
42 (b) [An image taken] A photograph or other recorded image produced by the
43 school bus infraction detection system , or the address of the Internet website on
44 which such an image may be viewed, showing [the] :
45 (1) The vehicle involved in the violation ; [or the address of the Internet
46 website on which such an image may be viewed; and]
47 (2) If a stop arm was installed on the school bus, that the stop arm was
48 extended at the time of the violation; and
49 (3) An electronic indicator evidencing that the flashing red light signals
50 of the bus were activated at the time of the violation; and
51 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection [5.
52 5.] 8.

Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 6
1 7. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection system shall
2 not record images of the occupants of a motor vehicle at the time in which the
3 images are recorded by the system. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to
4 this section may not be dismissed because a recorded video or digital image
5 includes images of the occupants of the motor vehicle.
6 8. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the driver of the
7 vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353 which was recorded by a
8 school bus infraction detection system. This presumption may be rebutted if the
9 registered owner of the vehicle submits an affidavit to the traffic enforcement
10 agency or its designee or presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
11 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating [:] under penalty of perjury:
12 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody and control of
13 the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
14 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
15 9. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph (b) of
16 subsection [5] 8 must contain evidence that supports the affidavit, including,
17 without limitation, a police report or an insurance report.
18 [6.] 10. Photographs or other recorded images produced by a school bus
19 infraction detection system shall be deemed prima facie evidence of a violation of
20 NRS 484B.353 and are admissible at any hearing for a citation issued for a
21 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to this
22 section without further authentication. In any hearing for a citation issued for a
23 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system, there is a
24 rebuttable presumption that:
25 (a) At the time in which a violation of NRS 484B.353 was detected by a
26 school bus infraction detection system, the school bus was marked and equipped
27 with signs and signals as required by law; and
28 (b) Where recorded images from a school bus infraction detection system
29 show the activation of a stop arm or flashing red light signals, the school bus was
30 stopped to receive or discharge a pupil and was displaying a flashing red light
31 signal visible from the front and rear of the school bus.
32 [7.] 11. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace officer from
33 issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of this State for which evidence
34 is recorded by a school bus infraction detection system if the peace officer
35 personally witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
36 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil infraction
37 citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus infraction detection system
38 for the same violation for which the peace officer issued the person the traffic
39 citation.
40 [8.] 12. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a hearing on a civil
41 infraction citation issued pursuant to this section shall be conducted in
42 accordance with NRS 484A.7041.
43 13. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction citation is
44 issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection [3:] 5:
45 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
46 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by the local
47 authority, but not less than [$50.
48 9.] the fine imposed pursuant to NRS 484B.353.
49 14. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all administrative fines
50 assessed and collected for a violation of NRS 484B.353 through the use of a
51 school bus infraction detection system must be collected and remitted to the
52 school district in which the violation occurred. The school district shall use the
53 fines collected by this section to:

Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 7
1 (a) Install, maintain or operate the school bus infraction detection systems
2 on school buses;
3 (b) Compensate a third party vendor to install, operate or maintain the
4 school bus infraction detection systems on school buses;
5 (c) Support any other infrastructure or program that increases the safety of
6 transportation services for students; or
7 (d) Pay costs associated with the enforcement of violations detected by a
8 school bus infraction detection system.
9 15. On or before January 31 of each year, each school district which uses a
10 school bus infraction detection system shall prepare and submit a report to the
11 Legislature for the immediately preceding year which includes, without
12 limitation:
13 (a) The number of citations issued through the use of school bus infraction
14 detection systems;
15 (b) The total amount of revenue collected as a result of such citations; and
16 (c) Any data related to the effectiveness of the use of school bus infraction
17 detection systems in reducing the number of violations of NRS 434B.353.
18 16. As used in this section, “school bus infraction detection system” means
19 [a stationary] an electronic or digital system which [creates] produces a
20 photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle which is used as evidence of a
21 violation of NRS 484B.353 by the driver of the vehicle.
22 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of this act, a
24 governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use photographic, video or
25 digital equipment for gathering evidence to be used for the issuance of a traffic
26 citation or civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of
27 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
28 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer, the equipment is
29 otherwise installed temporarily or permanently within a vehicle or facility of a law
30 enforcement agency or the equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental
31 entity.
32 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.700 [,] or
34 section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer makes an arrest or issues a citation
35 to a person for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the
36 police officer shall record the name as given by that person, the number of the
37 person’s driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
38 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for offenses kept at
39 the traffic enforcement agency which employs that officer.
40 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle for any
41 violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and requests information
42 from a traffic enforcement agency concerning that person’s record of prior offenses,
43 the police officer shall compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of
44 his or her driver’s license and physical description with any information obtained
45 from the agency as a result of the request. If the information received from the
46 agency indicates that the driver’s name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior
47 offense, the officer shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the
48 additional information used for comparison also connects the driver with that prior
49 offense.
50 Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.703 is hereby amended to read as follows:
51 484A.703 1. [Every] Except for a citation issued for a violation detected
52 by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act, every
53 traffic enforcement agency in this State shall provide in appropriate form civil

Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 8
1 infraction citations containing notice of the civil infraction which must meet the

7 a record of each book, each electronic device and each civil infraction citation
8 issued to individual members of the traffic enforcement agency. The chief
9 administrative officer shall require and retain a receipt for every book and
10 electronic device that is issued.
11 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction citation pursuant to
13 NRS 484A.7035 or 484A.7049 or section 2 of this act shall respond to the citation
14 as provided in this section not later than 90 calendar days after the date on which
15 the citation is issued.
16 2. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not contest the
17 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
18 citation, the person must respond to the citation by indicating that the person does
19 not contest the determination and submitting full payment of the monetary penalty,
20 the administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in the citation, or
21 its traffic violations bureau, in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
22 electronic means.
23 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to contest the
24 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
25 citation, the person must respond by requesting in person, by mail or through the
26 Internet or other electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
27 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing, but the date of the
28 hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days after the court provides notice of
29 the hearing.
30 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less than 30 days
31 before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil infraction citation, the court

33 the civil infraction citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
34 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after the date on
35 which the civil infraction citation is issued. If the person agreed to receive
36 communications relating to the civil infraction by text message, the court may send
37 such a notice to the telephone number of the person as indicated on the civil
38 infraction citation. If the person does not respond to the civil infraction citation in
39 the manner specified by subsection 2 or 3 within 90 calendar days after the date on

Assembly Amendment No. 322 to Assembly Bill No. 527 Page 9
1 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is found by the
2 court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to subsection 5 shall pay the
3 witness fees, per diem allowances, travel expenses and other reimbursement in
4 accordance with NRS 50.225.
5 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS 484A.615, any person

17 or passing a school bus which is positioned in the other roadway. The driver of a
18 vehicle need not stop upon meeting or passing a school bus where traffic is
19 controlled by a traffic officer.
20 3. [Any] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, any person who
