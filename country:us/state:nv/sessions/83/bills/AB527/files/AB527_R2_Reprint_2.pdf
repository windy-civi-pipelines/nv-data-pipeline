AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to
install and use a school bus infraction detection system on
school buses to enforce certain provisions of law;
requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
having jurisdiction over the location in which such school
buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the
school bus infraction detection system before a civil
infraction citation is issued; establishing requirements
relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by a school bus infraction detection
system; requiring the destruction of any photograph or
recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
detection system after a certain period of time;

a civil infraction citation issued for a violation detected by
a school bus infraction detection system; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
-
*AB527_R2*

– 2 –
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an
7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
8 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
9 school buses owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law
10 prohibiting a driver of any vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which:
11 (1) has stopped to receive or discharge any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing
12 red light signal visible from the front and rear. (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires
13 a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location in
14 which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to review the evidence
15 of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction citation is
16 issued. Section 2 further: (1) requires a school district that has not previously
17 installed and used a school bus infraction detection system to conduct a public
18 awareness campaign for not less than 30 days after the system is placed into use;
19 (2) requires the destruction of any photograph or recorded image produced by a
20 school bus infraction detection system after a certain period of time; (3) establishes
21 certain requirements for a hearing for a citation issued pursuant to section 2; (4)
22 applies an existing fine structure to a citation issued pursuant to section 2; (5)
23 requires a school district to use any fines collected pursuant to section 2 for certain
24 purposes; and (6) requires each school district that installs such a system to prepare
25 and submit an annual report to the Legislature relating to the school bus infraction
26 detection system. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a violation detected by a
27 school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic violation.
28 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
29 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment
30 of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for
31 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means
3 conviction of a moving traffic violation in any municipal court,
4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
13 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus
14 infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
15 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
16 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
17 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
-
*AB527_R2*

– 3 –
1 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
2 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
3 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
4 months.
5 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
6 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
7 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
8 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
9 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
10 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
11 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
12 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
13 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
14 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
15 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
16 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
17 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
18 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
19 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
20 thereto a new section to read as follows:
21 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the
22 installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
23 school buses owned by the school district to enforce the provisions
24 of NRS 484B.353.
25 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes
26 the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection
27 system:
28 (a) May enter into a contractual agreement with a third party
29 vendor to install and administer such a school bus infraction
30 detection system; and
31 (b) Shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement
32 agency with jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus
33 equipped with a school bus infraction detection system operates to
34 review the evidence of any alleged infraction of NRS 484B.353
35 recorded by the school bus infraction detection system.
36 3. If a school district has not previously installed and used a
37 school bus infraction detection system the school district shall, for
38 not less than 30 days after a school bus infraction detection system
39 is placed into use by the school district:
40 (a) Conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the use of
41 school bus infraction detection systems within the school district;
42 and
43 (b) Notify the public of the specific date on which a violation
44 detected by the school bus infraction detection system will become
45 enforceable.
-
*AB527_R2*

– 4 –
1 4. If, during the period the public awareness campaign
2 described in subsection 3 is conducted, a peace officer of a traffic
3 enforcement agency determines from evidence recorded by a
4 school bus infraction detection system that a person has violated
5 NRS 484B.353, the peace officer may issue only a warning.
6 5. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus
7 infraction detection system, a peace officer of a traffic
8 enforcement agency determines that a violation of NRS 484B.353
9 occurred in a location over which the traffic enforcement agency
10 has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil infraction
11 citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation
12 to be sent by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee by first
13 class mail to the address listed with the Department for the
14 registered owner of the vehicle identified by the school bus
15 infraction detection system. A manual or automated record
16 prepared by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee
17 evidencing that the citation was mailed is prima facie evidence of
18 service and shall be admissible in any hearing as to the facts
19 contained in the civil infraction citation.
20 6. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of
21 NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
22 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection 5 must include:
23 (a) The date and time of the violation;
24 (b) A photograph or other recorded image produced by the
25 school bus infraction detection system, or the address of the
26 Internet website on which such an image may be viewed, showing:
27 (1) The vehicle involved in the violation;
28 (2) If a stop arm was installed on the school bus, that the
29 stop arm was extended at the time of the violation; and
30 (3) An electronic indicator evidencing that the flashing red
31 light signals of the bus were activated at the time of the violation;
32 and
33 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 8.
34 7. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection
35 system shall not record images of the occupants of a motor vehicle
36 at the time in which the images are recorded by the system. A civil
37 infraction citation issued pursuant to this section may not be
38 dismissed because a recorded video or digital image includes
39 images of the occupants of the motor vehicle.
40 8. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
41 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353
42 which was recorded by a school bus infraction detection system.
43 This presumption may be rebutted if the registered owner of the
44 vehicle submits an affidavit to the traffic enforcement agency or
45 its designee or presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
-
*AB527_R2*

– 5 –
1 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating under penalty
2 of perjury:
3 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody
4 and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
5 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
6 9. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph
7 (b) of subsection 8 must contain evidence that supports the
8 affidavit, including, without limitation, a police report or an
9 insurance report.
10 10. Photographs or other recorded images produced by a
11 school bus infraction detection system shall be deemed prima facie
12 evidence of a violation of NRS 484B.353 and are admissible at any
13 hearing for a citation issued for a violation detected by a school
14 bus infraction detection system pursuant to this section without
15 further authentication. In any hearing for a citation issued for a
16 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system,
17 there is a rebuttable presumption that:
18 (a) At the time in which a violation of NRS 484B.353 was
19 detected by a school bus infraction detection system, the school
20 bus was marked and equipped with signs and signals as required
21 by law; and
22 (b) Where recorded images from a school bus infraction
23 detection system show the activation of a stop arm or flashing red
24 light signals, the school bus was stopped to receive or discharge a
25 pupil and was displaying a flashing red light signal visible from
26 the front and rear of the school bus.
27 11. Any photograph or recorded image produced by a school
28 bus infraction detection system must be destroyed not later than 90
29 days after:
30 (a) If a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency does not
31 cause to be issued a civil infraction citation pursuant to subsection
32 5 in connection with the photograph or recorded image, the date
33 on which the photograph or recorded image was produced; or
34 (b) If a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency causes to
35 be issued a civil infraction citation pursuant to subsection 5 in
36 connection with the photograph or recorded image, the date on
37 which:
38 (1) The person receiving the civil infraction citation
39 submits, pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 484A.704, full payment
40 of the monetary penalty, the administrative assessment and any
41 fees to the court specified in the citation;
42 (2) The court enters an order dismissing the civil infraction
43 citation in the court’s records; or
44 (3) The court enters an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043
45 finding that the person committed the civil infraction and
-

– 6 –
1 assessing the monetary penalty and administrative assessments
2 prescribed for the civil infraction.
3 12. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace
4 officer from issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of
5 this State for which evidence is recorded by a school bus
6 infraction detection system if the peace officer personally
7 witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
8 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil
9 infraction citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus
10 infraction detection system for the same violation for which the
11 peace officer issued the person the traffic citation.
12 13. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a hearing on
13 a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to this section shall be
14 conducted in accordance with NRS 484A.7041.
15 14. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction
16 citation is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation
17 described in subsection 5:
18 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
19 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by
20 the local authority, but not less than the fine imposed pursuant to
21 NRS 484B.353.
22 15. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all
23 administrative fines assessed and collected for a violation of NRS
24 484B.353 through the use of a school bus infraction detection
25 system must be collected and remitted to the school district in
26 which the violation occurred. The school district shall use the
27 fines collected by this section to:
28 (a) Install, maintain or operate the school bus infraction
29 detection systems on school buses;
30 (b) Compensate a third party vendor to install, operate or
31 maintain the school bus infraction detection systems on school
32 buses;
33 (c) Support any other infrastructure or program that increases
34 the safety of transportation services for students; or
35 (d) Pay costs associated with the enforcement of violations
36 detected by a school bus infraction detection system.
37 16. On or before January 31 of each year, each school
38 district which uses a school bus infraction detection system shall
39 prepare and submit a report to the Legislature for the immediately
40 preceding year which includes, without limitation:
41 (a) The number of citations issued through the use of school
42 bus infraction detection systems;
43 (b) The total amount of revenue collected as a result of such
44 citations; and
-
*AB527_R2*

– 7 –
1 (c) Any data related to the effectiveness of the use of school
2 bus infraction detection systems in reducing the number of
3 violations of NRS 484B.353.
4 17. As used in this section, “school bus infraction detection
5 system” means an electronic or digital system which produces a
6 photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle which is used as
7 evidence of a violation of NRS 484B.353 by the driver of the
8 vehicle.
9 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of

12 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to
13 be used for the issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction
14 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of chapters
15 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
16 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer,
17 the equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently
18 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency or the
19 equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental entity.
20 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS

23 makes an arrest or issues a citation to a person for any violation of
24 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the police officer shall
25 record the name as given by that person, the number of the person’s
26 driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
27 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for
28 offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which employs that
29 officer.
30 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle
31 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and
32 requests information from a traffic enforcement agency concerning
33 that person’s record of prior offenses, the police officer shall
34 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
35 driver’s license and physical description with any information
36 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
37 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
38 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
39 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional
40 information used for comparison also connects the driver with that
41 prior offense.
42 Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.703 is hereby amended to read as
43 follows:
44 484A.703 1. [Every] Except for a citation issued for a
