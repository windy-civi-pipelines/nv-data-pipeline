EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to
install and use a school bus infraction detection system on
school buses to enforce certain provisions of law;
requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
having jurisdiction over the location in which such school
buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the
school bus infraction detection system before a civil
infraction citation is issued; establishing requirements
relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by a school bus infraction detection
system; establishes certain requirements for a hearing
relating to a civil infraction citation issued for a violation

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an
7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
-

– 2 –
8 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
9 school buses owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law
10 prohibiting a driver of any vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which:
11 (1) has stopped to receive or discharge any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing
12 red light signal visible from the front and rear. (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires
13 a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location in
14 which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to review the evidence
15 of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction citation is
16 issued. Section 2 further: (1) requires a school district that has not previously
17 installed and used a school bus infraction detection system to conduct a public
18 awareness campaign for not less than 30 days after the system is placed into use;
19 (2) establishes certain requirements for a hearing for a citation issued pursuant to
20 section 2; (3) applies an existing fine structure to a citation issued pursuant
21 to section 2; (4) requires a school district to use any fines collected pursuant to
22 section 2 for certain purposes; and (5) requires each school district that installs such
23 a system to prepare and submit an annual report to the Legislature relating to the
24 school bus infraction detection system. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a
25 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is not a moving
26 traffic violation.
27 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
28 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment
29 of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for
30 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means
3 conviction of a moving traffic violation in any municipal court,
4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
13 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus
14 infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
15 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
16 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
17 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
18 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
19 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
20 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
21 months.
-
*AB527_R1*

– 3 –
1 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
2 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
3 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
4 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
5 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
6 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
7 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
8 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
9 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
10 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
11 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
12 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
13 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
14 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
15 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
16 thereto a new section to read as follows:
17 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the
18 installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
19 school buses owned by the school district to enforce the provisions
20 of NRS 484B.353.
21 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes
22 the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection
23 system:
24 (a) May enter into a contractual agreement with a third party
25 vendor to install and administer such a school bus infraction
26 detection system; and
27 (b) Shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement
28 agency with jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus
29 equipped with a school bus infraction detection system operates to
30 review the evidence of any alleged infraction of NRS 484B.353
31 recorded by the school bus infraction detection system.
32 3. If a school district has not previously installed and used a
33 school bus infraction detection system the school district shall, for
34 not less than 30 days after a school bus infraction detection system
35 is placed into use by the school district:
36 (a) Conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the use of
37 school bus infraction detection systems within the school district;
38 and
39 (b) Notify the public of the specific date on which a violation
40 detected by the school bus infraction detection system will become
41 enforceable.
42 4. If, during the period the public awareness campaign
43 described in subsection 3 is conducted, a peace officer of a traffic
44 enforcement agency determines from evidence recorded by a
-
*AB527_R1*

– 4 –
1 school bus infraction detection system that a person has violated
2 NRS 484B.353, the peace officer may issue only a warning.
3 5. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus
4 infraction detection system, a peace officer of a traffic
5 enforcement agency determines that a violation of NRS 484B.353
6 occurred in a location over which the traffic enforcement agency
7 has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil infraction
8 citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation
9 to be sent by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee by first
10 class mail to the address listed with the Department for the
11 registered owner of the vehicle identified by the school bus
12 infraction detection system. A manual or automated record
13 prepared by the law enforcement agency or its designee evidencing
14 that the citation was mailed is prima facie evidence of service and
15 shall be admissible in any hearing as to the facts contained in the
16 civil infraction citation.
17 6. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of
18 NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
19 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection 5 must include:
20 (a) The date and time of the violation;
21 (b) A photograph or other recorded image produced by the
22 school bus infraction detection system, or the address of the
23 Internet website on which such an image may be viewed, showing:
24 (1) The vehicle involved in the violation;
25 (2) If a stop arm was installed on the school bus, that the
26 stop arm was extended at the time of the violation; and
27 (3) An electronic indicator evidencing that the flashing red
28 light signals of the bus were activated at the time of the violation;
29 and
30 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 8.
31 7. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection
32 system shall not record images of the occupants of a motor vehicle
33 at the time in which the images are recorded by the system. A civil
34 infraction citation issued pursuant to this section may not be
35 dismissed because a recorded video or digital image includes
36 images of the occupants of the motor vehicle.
37 8. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
38 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353
39 which was recorded by a school bus infraction detection system.
40 This presumption may be rebutted if the registered owner of the
41 vehicle submits an affidavit to the traffic enforcement agency or
42 its designee or presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
43 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating under penalty
44 of perjury:
-
*AB527_R1*

– 5 –
1 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody
2 and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
3 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
4 9. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph
5 (b) of subsection 8 must contain evidence that supports the
6 affidavit, including, without limitation, a police report or an
7 insurance report.
8 10. Photographs or other recorded images produced by a
9 school bus infraction detection system shall be deemed prima facie
10 evidence of a violation of NRS 484B.353 and are admissible at any
11 hearing for a citation issued for a violation detected by a school
12 bus infraction detection system pursuant to this section without
13 further authentication. In any hearing for a citation issued for a
14 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system,
15 there is a rebuttable presumption that:
16 (a) At the time in which a violation of NRS 484B.353 was
17 detected by a school bus infraction detection system, the school
18 bus was marked and equipped with signs and signals as required
19 by law; and
20 (b) Where recorded images from a school bus infraction
21 detection system show the activation of a stop arm or flashing red
22 light signals, the school bus was stopped to receive or discharge a
23 pupil and was displaying a flashing red light signal visible from
24 the front and rear of the school bus.
25 11. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace
26 officer from issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of
27 this State for which evidence is recorded by a school bus
28 infraction detection system if the peace officer personally
29 witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
30 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil
31 infraction citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus
32 infraction detection system for the same violation for which the
33 peace officer issued the person the traffic citation.
34 12. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a hearing on
35 a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to this section shall be
36 conducted in accordance with NRS 484A.7041.
37 13. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction
38 citation is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation
39 described in subsection 5:
40 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
41 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by
42 the local authority, but not less than the fine imposed pursuant to
43 NRS 484B.353.
44 14. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all
45 administrative fines assessed and collected for a violation of
-
*AB527_R1*

– 6 –
1 NRS 484B.353 through the use of a school bus infraction
2 detection system must be collected and remitted to the school
3 district in which the violation occurred. The school district shall
4 use the fines collected by this section to:
5 (a) Install, maintain or operate the school bus infraction
6 detection systems on school buses;
7 (b) Compensate a third party vendor to install, operate or
8 maintain the school bus infraction detection systems on school
9 buses;
10 (c) Support any other infrastructure or program that increases
11 the safety of transportation services for students; or
12 (d) Pay costs associated with the enforcement of violations
13 detected by a school bus infraction detection system.
14 15. On or before January 31 of each year, each school
15 district which uses a school bus infraction detection system shall
16 prepare and submit a report to the Legislature for the immediately
17 preceding year which includes, without limitation:
18 (a) The number of citations issued through the use of school
19 bus infraction detection systems;
20 (b) The total amount of revenue collected as a result of such
21 citations; and
22 (c) Any data related to the effectiveness of the use of school
23 bus infraction detection systems in reducing the number of
24 violations of NRS 434B.353.
25 16. As used in this section, “school bus infraction detection
26 system” means an electronic or digital system which produces a
27 photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle which is used as
28 evidence of a violation of NRS 484B.353 by the driver of the
29 vehicle.
30 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of
32 this act, a governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use
33 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to
34 be used for the issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction
35 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of chapters
36 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
37 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer,
38 the equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently
39 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency or the
40 equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental entity.
41 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS
43 484A.700 [,] or section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer
44 makes an arrest or issues a citation to a person for any violation of
45 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the police officer shall
-
*AB527_R1*

– 7 –
1 record the name as given by that person, the number of the person’s
2 driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
3 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for
4 offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which employs that
5 officer.
6 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle
7 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and
8 requests information from a traffic enforcement agency concerning
9 that person’s record of prior offenses, the police officer shall
10 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
11 driver’s license and physical description with any information
12 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
13 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
14 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
15 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional
16 information used for comparison also connects the driver with that
17 prior offense.
18 Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.703 is hereby amended to read as
19 follows:
20 484A.703 1. [Every] Except for a citation issued for a
21 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system
22 pursuant to section 2 of this act, every traffic enforcement agency
23 in this State shall provide in appropriate form civil infraction
24 citations containing notice of the civil infraction which must meet
25 the requirements of NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive, and be:
26 (a) Issued in books; or
27 (b) Available through an electronic device used to prepare such
28 citations.
29 2. The chief administrative officer of each traffic enforcement
30 agency is responsible for the issuance of such books and electronic
31 devices and shall maintain a record of each book, each electronic
32 device and each civil infraction citation issued to individual
33 members of the traffic enforcement agency. The chief administrative
34 officer shall require and retain a receipt for every book and
35 electronic device that is issued.
36 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction
38 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 or 484A.7049 or section 2 of
39 this act shall respond to the citation as provided in this section not
40 later than 90 calendar days after the date on which the citation is
41 issued.
42 2. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not
43 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
44 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond to the
45 citation by indicating that the person does not contest the
-

2 the administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in
3 the citation, or its traffic violations bureau, in person, by mail or
4 through the Internet or other electronic means.
5 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to
6 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
7 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond by
8 requesting in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
9 electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
10 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing,
11 but the date of the hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days
12 after the court provides notice of the hearing.
13 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less
14 than 30 days before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil
15 infraction citation, the court must send to the address or electronic
16 mail address of the person, as indicated on the civil infraction
17 citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
18 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after
19 the date on which the civil infraction citation is issued. If the person
20 agreed to receive communications relating to the civil infraction by
21 text message, the court may send such a notice to the telephone
22 number of the person as indicated on the civil infraction citation. If
23 the person does not respond to the civil infraction citation in the
24 manner specified by subsection 2 or 3 within 90 calendar days after
25 the date on which the civil infraction citation is issued, the court
26 must enter an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the
27 person committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary
28 penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil
29 infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation
30 and who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required
31 by this section may not appeal an order entered pursuant to this
32 section.
33 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear
34 at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter
35 an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person
36 committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty
37 and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction. A
38 person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails
39 to appear at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not
40 appeal an order entered pursuant to this subsection.
41 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is
42 found by the court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to

11 shall bring the vehicle to an immediate stop and shall not attempt to
12 overtake or proceed past the school bus until the flashing red signal
13 ceases operation.
14 2. The driver of a vehicle upon a divided highway need not
15 stop upon meeting or passing a school bus which is positioned in the
16 other roadway. The driver of a vehicle need not stop upon meeting
