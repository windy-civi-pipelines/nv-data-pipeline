EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to install and use a
school bus infraction detection system on school buses to enforce
certain provisions of law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic
enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the location in which such
school buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the school
bus infraction detection system before a civil infraction citation is
issued; establishing requirements relating to the issuance of a civil
infraction citation based on evidence detected by a school bus
infraction detection system; requiring the destruction of any
photograph or recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
detection system after a certain period of time; establishing certain
requirements for a hearing relating to a civil infraction citation issued
for a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using photographic, video
2 or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation or civil infraction
3 citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording device worn or held
4 by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3)
5 privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill
6 create an exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
7 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses
8 owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law prohibiting a driver of any
9 vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which: (1) has stopped to receive or discharge
10 any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing red light signal visible from the front and rear.
11 (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with
12 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to
Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 4
13 review the evidence of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction
14 citation is issued. Section 2 further: (1) requires a school district that has not previously
15 installed and used a school bus infraction detection system to conduct a public awareness
16 campaign for not less than 30 days after the system is placed into use; (2) requires the
17 destruction of any photograph or recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
18 detection system after a certain period of time; (3) establishes certain requirements for a
19 hearing for a citation issued pursuant to section 2; [(3)] (4) applies an existing fine structure to
20 a citation issued pursuant to section 2; [(4)] (5) requires a school district to use any fines
21 collected pursuant to section 2 for certain purposes; and [(5)] (6) requires each school district
22 that installs such a system to prepare and submit an annual report to the Legislature relating to
23 the school bus infraction detection system. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a
24 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic violation.
25 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
26 detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment of demerit points;
27 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by a school
28 bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means conviction of a
3 moving traffic violation in any municipal court, justice court or district court in this
4 State or a finding by any municipal court or justice court in this State that a person
5 has committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive.
6 The term includes a finding by a juvenile court that a child has violated a traffic law
7 or ordinance other than one governing standing or parking. The term does not
8 include [a] :
9 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of the speed
10 limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances described in subsection 1
11 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
12 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus infraction
13 detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
14 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
15 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
16 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons
17 deemed to have future driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system
18 must be based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12 months.
19 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the Department shall set
20 up a schedule of demerits for each traffic violation, depending upon the gravity of
21 the violation, on a scale of one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law
22 to eight demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law governing
23 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
24 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
25 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
26 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
27 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or finding is
28 obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated system of demerits within
29 each category of violations according to the extent to which the traffic law was
30 violated.
Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 5
1 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the installation and
4 use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses owned by the
5 school district to enforce the provisions of NRS 484B.353.
6 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes the installation
7 and use of a school bus infraction detection system:
8 (a) May enter into a contractual agreement with a third party vendor to
9 install and administer such a school bus infraction detection system; and
10 (b) Shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement agency with
11 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with a school bus
12 infraction detection system operates to review the evidence of any alleged
13 infraction of NRS 484B.353 recorded by the school bus infraction detection
14 system.
15 3. If a school district has not previously installed and used a school bus
16 infraction detection system the school district shall, for not less than 30 days after
17 a school bus infraction detection system is placed into use by the school district:
18 (a) Conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the use of school bus
19 infraction detection systems within the school district; and
20 (b) Notify the public of the specific date on which a violation detected by the
21 school bus infraction detection system will become enforceable.
22 4. If, during the period the public awareness campaign described in
23 subsection 3 is conducted, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
24 determines from evidence recorded by a school bus infraction detection system
25 that a person has violated NRS 484B.353, the peace officer may issue only a
26 warning.
27 5. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus infraction
28 detection system, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency determines that
29 a violation of NRS 484B.353 occurred in a location over which the traffic
30 enforcement agency has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil
31 infraction citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation to be
32 sent by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee by first class mail to the
33 address listed with the Department for the registered owner of the vehicle
34 identified by the school bus infraction detection system. A manual or automated
35 record prepared by the [law] traffic enforcement agency or its designee
36 evidencing that the citation was mailed is prima facie evidence of service and
37 shall be admissible in any hearing as to the facts contained in the civil infraction
38 citation.
39 6. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of NRS
40 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a
41 violation described in subsection 5 must include:
42 (a) The date and time of the violation;
43 (b) A photograph or other recorded image produced by the school bus
44 infraction detection system, or the address of the Internet website on which such
45 an image may be viewed, showing:
46 (1) The vehicle involved in the violation;
47 (2) If a stop arm was installed on the school bus, that the stop arm was
48 extended at the time of the violation; and
49 (3) An electronic indicator evidencing that the flashing red light signals
50 of the bus were activated at the time of the violation; and
51 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 8.
52 7. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection system shall
53 not record images of the occupants of a motor vehicle at the time in which the
Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 6
1 images are recorded by the system. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to
2 this section may not be dismissed because a recorded video or digital image
3 includes images of the occupants of the motor vehicle.
4 8. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the driver of the
5 vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353 which was recorded by a
6 school bus infraction detection system. This presumption may be rebutted if the
7 registered owner of the vehicle submits an affidavit to the traffic enforcement
8 agency or its designee or presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
9 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating under penalty of perjury:
10 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody and control of
11 the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
12 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
13 9. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph (b) of
14 subsection 8 must contain evidence that supports the affidavit, including, without
15 limitation, a police report or an insurance report.
16 10. Photographs or other recorded images produced by a school bus
17 infraction detection system shall be deemed prima facie evidence of a violation of
18 NRS 484B.353 and are admissible at any hearing for a citation issued for a
19 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to this
20 section without further authentication. In any hearing for a citation issued for a
21 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system, there is a
22 rebuttable presumption that:
23 (a) At the time in which a violation of NRS 484B.353 was detected by a
24 school bus infraction detection system, the school bus was marked and equipped
25 with signs and signals as required by law; and
26 (b) Where recorded images from a school bus infraction detection system
27 show the activation of a stop arm or flashing red light signals, the school bus was
28 stopped to receive or discharge a pupil and was displaying a flashing red light
29 signal visible from the front and rear of the school bus.
30 11. Any photograph or recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
31 detection system must be destroyed not later than 90 days after:
32 (a) If a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency does not cause to be
33 issued a civil infraction citation pursuant to subsection 5 in connection with the
34 photograph or recorded image, the date on which the photograph or recorded
35 image was produced; or
36 (b) If a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency causes to be issued a
37 civil infraction citation pursuant to subsection 5 in connection with the
38 photograph or recorded image, the date on which:
39 (1) The person receiving the civil infraction citation submits, pursuant to
40 subsection 2 of NRS 484A.704, full payment of the monetary penalty, the
41 administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in the citation;
42 (2) The court enters an order dismissing the civil infraction citation in
43 the court’s records; or
44 (3) The court enters an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that
45 the person committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty and
46 administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction.
47 12. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace officer from
48 issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of this State for which evidence
49 is recorded by a school bus infraction detection system if the peace officer
50 personally witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
51 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil infraction
52 citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus infraction detection system
Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 7
1 for the same violation for which the peace officer issued the person the traffic
2 citation.
3 [12.] 13. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a hearing on a civil
4 infraction citation issued pursuant to this section shall be conducted in
5 accordance with NRS 484A.7041.
6 [13.] 14. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction citation
7 is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection 5:
8 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
9 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by the local
10 authority, but not less than the fine imposed pursuant to NRS 484B.353.
11 [14.] 15. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all administrative
12 fines assessed and collected for a violation of NRS 484B.353 through the use of a
13 school bus infraction detection system must be collected and remitted to the
14 school district in which the violation occurred. The school district shall use the
15 fines collected by this section to:
16 (a) Install, maintain or operate the school bus infraction detection systems
17 on school buses;
18 (b) Compensate a third party vendor to install, operate or maintain the
19 school bus infraction detection systems on school buses;
20 (c) Support any other infrastructure or program that increases the safety of
21 transportation services for students; or
22 (d) Pay costs associated with the enforcement of violations detected by a
23 school bus infraction detection system.
24 [15.] 16. On or before January 31 of each year, each school district which
25 uses a school bus infraction detection system shall prepare and submit a report to
26 the Legislature for the immediately preceding year which includes, without
27 limitation:
28 (a) The number of citations issued through the use of school bus infraction
29 detection systems;
30 (b) The total amount of revenue collected as a result of such citations; and
31 (c) Any data related to the effectiveness of the use of school bus infraction
32 detection systems in reducing the number of violations of NRS [434B.353.]
33 484B.353.
34 16. 17. As used in this section, “school bus infraction detection system”
35 means an electronic or digital system which produces a photograph or other
36 recorded image of a vehicle which is used as evidence of a violation of NRS
37 484B.353 by the driver of the vehicle.
38 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
39 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of this act, a
40 governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use photographic, video or
41 digital equipment for gathering evidence to be used for the issuance of a traffic
42 citation or civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of
43 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
44 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer, the equipment is
45 otherwise installed temporarily or permanently within a vehicle or facility of a law
46 enforcement agency or the equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental
47 entity.
48 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
49 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.700 [,] or
50 section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer makes an arrest or issues a citation
51 to a person for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the
52 police officer shall record the name as given by that person, the number of the
53 person’s driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical

4 violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and requests information
5 from a traffic enforcement agency concerning that person’s record of prior offenses,
6 the police officer shall compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of
7 his or her driver’s license and physical description with any information obtained
8 from the agency as a result of the request. If the information received from the
9 agency indicates that the driver’s name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior
10 offense, the officer shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the
11 additional information used for comparison also connects the driver with that prior
12 offense.
13 Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.703 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 484A.703 1. [Every] Except for a citation issued for a violation detected

25 administrative officer shall require and retain a receipt for every book and
26 electronic device that is issued.
27 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:

40 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
41 citation, the person must respond by requesting in person, by mail or through the
42 Internet or other electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
43 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing, but the date of the
44 hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days after the court provides notice of
45 the hearing.
46 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less than 30 days

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to install and use a
school bus infraction detection system on school buses to enforce
certain provisions of law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic
enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the location in which such
school buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the school
bus infraction detection system before a civil infraction citation is
issued; establishing requirements relating to the issuance of a civil
infraction citation based on evidence detected by a school bus
infraction detection system; requiring the destruction of any
photograph or recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
detection system after a certain period of time; establishing certain
requirements for a hearing relating to a civil infraction citation issued
for a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using photographic, video
2 or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation or civil infraction
3 citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording device worn or held
4 by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3)
5 privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill
6 create an exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
7 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses
8 owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law prohibiting a driver of any
9 vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which: (1) has stopped to receive or discharge
10 any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing red light signal visible from the front and rear.
11 (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with
12 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to

Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 4
13 review the evidence of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction
14 citation is issued. Section 2 further: (1) requires a school district that has not previously
15 installed and used a school bus infraction detection system to conduct a public awareness
16 campaign for not less than 30 days after the system is placed into use; (2) requires the
17 destruction of any photograph or recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
18 detection system after a certain period of time; (3) establishes certain requirements for a
19 hearing for a citation issued pursuant to section 2; [(3)] (4) applies an existing fine structure to
20 a citation issued pursuant to section 2; [(4)] (5) requires a school district to use any fines
21 collected pursuant to section 2 for certain purposes; and [(5)] (6) requires each school district
22 that installs such a system to prepare and submit an annual report to the Legislature relating to
23 the school bus infraction detection system. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a
24 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic violation.
25 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
26 detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment of demerit points;
27 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by a school
28 bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means conviction of a
3 moving traffic violation in any municipal court, justice court or district court in this
4 State or a finding by any municipal court or justice court in this State that a person
5 has committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive.
6 The term includes a finding by a juvenile court that a child has violated a traffic law
7 or ordinance other than one governing standing or parking. The term does not
8 include [a] :
9 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of the speed
10 limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances described in subsection 1
11 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
12 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus infraction
13 detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
14 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
15 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
16 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons
17 deemed to have future driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system
18 must be based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12 months.
19 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the Department shall set
20 up a schedule of demerits for each traffic violation, depending upon the gravity of
21 the violation, on a scale of one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law
22 to eight demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law governing
23 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
24 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
25 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
26 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
27 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or finding is
28 obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated system of demerits within
29 each category of violations according to the extent to which the traffic law was
30 violated.

Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 5
1 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the installation and
4 use of a school bus infraction detection system in school buses owned by the
5 school district to enforce the provisions of NRS 484B.353.
6 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes the installation
7 and use of a school bus infraction detection system:
8 (a) May enter into a contractual agreement with a third party vendor to
9 install and administer such a school bus infraction detection system; and
10 (b) Shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement agency with
11 jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus equipped with a school bus
12 infraction detection system operates to review the evidence of any alleged
13 infraction of NRS 484B.353 recorded by the school bus infraction detection
14 system.
15 3. If a school district has not previously installed and used a school bus
16 infraction detection system the school district shall, for not less than 30 days after
17 a school bus infraction detection system is placed into use by the school district:
18 (a) Conduct a public awareness campaign regarding the use of school bus
19 infraction detection systems within the school district; and
20 (b) Notify the public of the specific date on which a violation detected by the
21 school bus infraction detection system will become enforceable.
22 4. If, during the period the public awareness campaign described in
23 subsection 3 is conducted, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
24 determines from evidence recorded by a school bus infraction detection system
25 that a person has violated NRS 484B.353, the peace officer may issue only a
26 warning.
27 5. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus infraction
28 detection system, a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency determines that
29 a violation of NRS 484B.353 occurred in a location over which the traffic
30 enforcement agency has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil
31 infraction citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation to be
32 sent by the traffic enforcement agency or its designee by first class mail to the
33 address listed with the Department for the registered owner of the vehicle
34 identified by the school bus infraction detection system. A manual or automated
35 record prepared by the [law] traffic enforcement agency or its designee
36 evidencing that the citation was mailed is prima facie evidence of service and
37 shall be admissible in any hearing as to the facts contained in the civil infraction
38 citation.
39 6. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of NRS
40 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a
41 violation described in subsection 5 must include:
42 (a) The date and time of the violation;
43 (b) A photograph or other recorded image produced by the school bus
44 infraction detection system, or the address of the Internet website on which such
45 an image may be viewed, showing:
46 (1) The vehicle involved in the violation;
47 (2) If a stop arm was installed on the school bus, that the stop arm was
48 extended at the time of the violation; and
49 (3) An electronic indicator evidencing that the flashing red light signals
50 of the bus were activated at the time of the violation; and
51 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 8.
52 7. To the extent practicable, a school bus infraction detection system shall
53 not record images of the occupants of a motor vehicle at the time in which the

Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 6
1 images are recorded by the system. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to
2 this section may not be dismissed because a recorded video or digital image
3 includes images of the occupants of the motor vehicle.
4 8. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the driver of the
5 vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353 which was recorded by a
6 school bus infraction detection system. This presumption may be rebutted if the
7 registered owner of the vehicle submits an affidavit to the traffic enforcement
8 agency or its designee or presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
9 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating under penalty of perjury:
10 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody and control of
11 the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
12 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
13 9. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph (b) of
14 subsection 8 must contain evidence that supports the affidavit, including, without
15 limitation, a police report or an insurance report.
16 10. Photographs or other recorded images produced by a school bus
17 infraction detection system shall be deemed prima facie evidence of a violation of
18 NRS 484B.353 and are admissible at any hearing for a citation issued for a
19 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to this
20 section without further authentication. In any hearing for a citation issued for a
21 violation detected by a school bus infraction detection system, there is a
22 rebuttable presumption that:
23 (a) At the time in which a violation of NRS 484B.353 was detected by a
24 school bus infraction detection system, the school bus was marked and equipped
25 with signs and signals as required by law; and
26 (b) Where recorded images from a school bus infraction detection system
27 show the activation of a stop arm or flashing red light signals, the school bus was
28 stopped to receive or discharge a pupil and was displaying a flashing red light
29 signal visible from the front and rear of the school bus.
30 11. Any photograph or recorded image produced by a school bus infraction
31 detection system must be destroyed not later than 90 days after:
32 (a) If a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency does not cause to be
33 issued a civil infraction citation pursuant to subsection 5 in connection with the
34 photograph or recorded image, the date on which the photograph or recorded
35 image was produced; or
36 (b) If a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency causes to be issued a
37 civil infraction citation pursuant to subsection 5 in connection with the
38 photograph or recorded image, the date on which:
39 (1) The person receiving the civil infraction citation submits, pursuant to
40 subsection 2 of NRS 484A.704, full payment of the monetary penalty, the
41 administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in the citation;
42 (2) The court enters an order dismissing the civil infraction citation in
43 the court’s records; or
44 (3) The court enters an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that
45 the person committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty and
46 administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction.
47 12. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace officer from
48 issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of this State for which evidence
49 is recorded by a school bus infraction detection system if the peace officer
50 personally witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
51 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil infraction
52 citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus infraction detection system

Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 7
1 for the same violation for which the peace officer issued the person the traffic
2 citation.
3 [12.] 13. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a hearing on a civil
4 infraction citation issued pursuant to this section shall be conducted in
5 accordance with NRS 484A.7041.
6 [13.] 14. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction citation
7 is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection 5:
8 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
9 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by the local
10 authority, but not less than the fine imposed pursuant to NRS 484B.353.
11 [14.] 15. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all administrative
12 fines assessed and collected for a violation of NRS 484B.353 through the use of a
13 school bus infraction detection system must be collected and remitted to the
14 school district in which the violation occurred. The school district shall use the
15 fines collected by this section to:
16 (a) Install, maintain or operate the school bus infraction detection systems
17 on school buses;
18 (b) Compensate a third party vendor to install, operate or maintain the
19 school bus infraction detection systems on school buses;
20 (c) Support any other infrastructure or program that increases the safety of
21 transportation services for students; or
22 (d) Pay costs associated with the enforcement of violations detected by a
23 school bus infraction detection system.
24 [15.] 16. On or before January 31 of each year, each school district which
25 uses a school bus infraction detection system shall prepare and submit a report to
26 the Legislature for the immediately preceding year which includes, without
27 limitation:
28 (a) The number of citations issued through the use of school bus infraction
29 detection systems;
30 (b) The total amount of revenue collected as a result of such citations; and
31 (c) Any data related to the effectiveness of the use of school bus infraction
32 detection systems in reducing the number of violations of NRS [434B.353.]
33 484B.353.
34 16. 17. As used in this section, “school bus infraction detection system”
35 means an electronic or digital system which produces a photograph or other
36 recorded image of a vehicle which is used as evidence of a violation of NRS
37 484B.353 by the driver of the vehicle.
38 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
39 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of this act, a
40 governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use photographic, video or
41 digital equipment for gathering evidence to be used for the issuance of a traffic
42 citation or civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of
43 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
44 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer, the equipment is
45 otherwise installed temporarily or permanently within a vehicle or facility of a law
46 enforcement agency or the equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental
47 entity.
48 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
49 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.700 [,] or
50 section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer makes an arrest or issues a citation
51 to a person for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the
52 police officer shall record the name as given by that person, the number of the
53 person’s driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical

Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 8
1 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for offenses kept at
2 the traffic enforcement agency which employs that officer.
3 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle for any
4 violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and requests information
5 from a traffic enforcement agency concerning that person’s record of prior offenses,
6 the police officer shall compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of
7 his or her driver’s license and physical description with any information obtained
8 from the agency as a result of the request. If the information received from the
9 agency indicates that the driver’s name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior
10 offense, the officer shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the
11 additional information used for comparison also connects the driver with that prior
12 offense.
13 Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.703 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 484A.703 1. [Every] Except for a citation issued for a violation detected
15 by a school bus infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act, every
16 traffic enforcement agency in this State shall provide in appropriate form civil
17 infraction citations containing notice of the civil infraction which must meet the
18 requirements of NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive, and be:
19 (a) Issued in books; or
20 (b) Available through an electronic device used to prepare such citations.
21 2. The chief administrative officer of each traffic enforcement agency is
22 responsible for the issuance of such books and electronic devices and shall maintain
23 a record of each book, each electronic device and each civil infraction citation
24 issued to individual members of the traffic enforcement agency. The chief
25 administrative officer shall require and retain a receipt for every book and
26 electronic device that is issued.
27 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction citation pursuant to
29 NRS 484A.7035 or 484A.7049 or section 2 of this act shall respond to the citation
30 as provided in this section not later than 90 calendar days after the date on which
31 the citation is issued.
32 2. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not contest the
33 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
34 citation, the person must respond to the citation by indicating that the person does
35 not contest the determination and submitting full payment of the monetary penalty,
36 the administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in the citation, or
37 its traffic violations bureau, in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
38 electronic means.
39 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to contest the
40 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
41 citation, the person must respond by requesting in person, by mail or through the
42 Internet or other electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
43 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing, but the date of the
44 hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days after the court provides notice of
45 the hearing.
46 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less than 30 days
47 before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil infraction citation, the court
48 must send to the address or electronic mail address of the person, as indicated on
49 the civil infraction citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
50 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after the date on
51 which the civil infraction citation is issued. If the person agreed to receive
52 communications relating to the civil infraction by text message, the court may send
53 such a notice to the telephone number of the person as indicated on the civil

Senate Amendment No. 600 to Assembly Bill No. 527 First Reprint Page 9
1 infraction citation. If the person does not respond to the civil infraction citation in
2 the manner specified by subsection 2 or 3 within 90 calendar days after the date on
3 which the civil infraction citation is issued, the court must enter an order pursuant
4 to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person committed the civil infraction and
5 assessing the monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the
6 civil infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who
7 fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required by this section may not
8 appeal an order entered pursuant to this section.
9 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear at a hearing
10 requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter an order pursuant to NRS
11 484A.7043 finding that the person committed the civil infraction and assessing the
12 monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction.
13 A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails to appear at a
14 hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not appeal an order entered
15 pursuant to this subsection.
16 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is found by the
17 court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to subsection 5 shall pay the
18 witness fees, per diem allowances, travel expenses and other reimbursement in
19 accordance with NRS 50.225.
20 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS 484A.615, any person
21 issued a civil infraction citation may, if authorized by the court, use the system to
22 perform any applicable actions pursuant to this section.
23 Sec. 6. NRS 484B.353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 484B.353 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the driver of any

26 equipped with signs and signals required by law, which has stopped to receive or
27 discharge any pupil and is displaying a flashing red light signal visible from the
28 front and rear, shall bring the vehicle to an immediate stop and shall not attempt to
29 overtake or proceed past the school bus until the flashing red signal ceases
30 operation.
31 2. The driver of a vehicle upon a divided highway need not stop upon meeting
32 or passing a school bus which is positioned in the other roadway. The driver of a
33 vehicle need not stop upon meeting or passing a school bus where traffic is
34 controlled by a traffic officer.
35 3. [Any] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, any person who
