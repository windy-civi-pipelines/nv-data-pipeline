(BDR 43-421)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to
install and use a school bus infraction detection system on
school buses to enforce certain provisions of law;
requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
having jurisdiction over the location in which such school
buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the
school bus infraction detection system before a civil
infraction citation is issued; establishing requirements
relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by a school bus infraction detection
system; creating a rebuttable presumption that the driver
of a vehicle at the time of a violation recorded by a school
bus infraction detection system is the registered owner of
the vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an
-
*AB527*
– 2 –
7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
8 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
9 school buses owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law
10 prohibiting a driver of any vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which:
11 (1) has stopped to receive or discharge any pupil; and (2) is displaying a flashing
12 red light signal visible from the front and rear. (NRS 484B.353) Section 2 requires
13 a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location in
14 which any school bus equipped with such a system operates to review the evidence
15 of such a violation recorded by the system before a civil infraction citation is
16 issued. Section 2 further creates a rebuttable presumption that the driver of the
17 vehicle at the time of a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection
18 system is the registered owner of the vehicle and provides a method for rebutting
19 this presumption. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a violation detected by a
20 school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic violation.
21 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
22 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment
23 of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for
24 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means
3 conviction of a moving traffic violation in any municipal court,
4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
13 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus
14 infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
15 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
16 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
17 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
18 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
19 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
20 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
21 months.
22 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
23 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
24 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
25 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
-
*AB527*
– 3 –
1 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
2 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
3 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
4 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
5 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
6 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
7 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
8 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
9 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
10 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
11 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
12 thereto a new section to read as follows:
13 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the
14 installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
15 school buses owned by the school district to enforce the provisions
16 of NRS 484B.353.
17 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes
18 the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system
19 shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement agency
20 with jurisdiction over the location in which any school bus
21 equipped with a school bus infraction detection system operates to
22 review the evidence of any alleged infraction of NRS 484B.353
23 recorded by the school bus infraction detection system.
24 3. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus
25 infraction detection system, a peace officer of a traffic
26 enforcement agency determines that a violation of NRS 484B.353
27 occurred in a location over which the traffic enforcement agency
28 has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil infraction
29 citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation
30 to be sent by the traffic enforcement agency by first class mail to
31 the address listed with the Department for the registered owner of
32 the vehicle identified by the school bus infraction detection system.
33 4. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of
34 NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
35 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection 3 must include:
36 (a) The date and time of the violation;
37 (b) An image taken by the school bus infraction detection
38 system showing the vehicle involved in the violation or the address
39 of the Internet website on which such an image may be viewed;
40 and
41 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 5.
42 5. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
43 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353
44 which was recorded by a school bus infraction detection system.
45 This presumption may be rebutted if the registered owner of the
-
*AB527*
– 4 –
1 vehicle presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
2 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating:
3 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody
4 and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
5 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
6 6. An affidavit presented as evidence pursuant to paragraph
7 (b) of subsection 5 must contain evidence that supports the
8 affidavit, including, without limitation, a police report or an
9 insurance report.
10 7. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace
11 officer from issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of
12 this State for which evidence is recorded by a school bus
13 infraction detection system if the peace officer personally
14 witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a traffic citation by a
15 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil
16 infraction citation based on evidence recorded by the school bus
17 infraction detection system for the same violation for which the
18 peace officer issued the person the traffic citation.
19 8. A violation of NRS 484B.353 for which a civil infraction
20 citation is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for a violation
21 described in subsection 3:
22 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
23 (b) Is punishable by an administrative fine in an amount set by
24 the local authority, but not less than $50.

26 system” means a stationary electronic or digital system which
27 creates a photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle which is
28 used as evidence of a violation of NRS 484B.353 by the driver of
29 the vehicle.
30 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of
32 this act, a governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use
33 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to
34 be used for the issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction
35 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of chapters
36 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
37 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer,
38 the equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently
39 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency or the
40 equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental entity.
41 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS
43 484A.700 [,] or section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer
44 makes an arrest or issues a citation to a person for any violation of

-
*AB527*
– 5 –
1 record the name as given by that person, the number of the person’s
2 driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
3 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for
4 offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which employs that
5 officer.
6 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle
7 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and
8 requests information from a traffic enforcement agency concerning
9 that person’s record of prior offenses, the police officer shall
10 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
11 driver’s license and physical description with any information
12 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
13 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
14 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
15 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional
16 information used for comparison also connects the driver with that
17 prior offense.
18 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction

36 electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify

41 than 30 days before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil
42 infraction citation, the court must send to the address or electronic
43 mail address of the person, as indicated on the civil infraction
44 citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
45 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after
-

13 by this section may not appeal an order entered pursuant to this
14 section.
15 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear
16 at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter
17 an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person
18 committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty
19 and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction. A
20 person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails
21 to appear at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not

(BDR 43-421)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to traffic laws; authorizing a school district to
install and use a school bus infraction detection system on
school buses to enforce certain provisions of law;
requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
having jurisdiction over the location in which such school
buses operate to review certain evidence detected by the
school bus infraction detection system before a civil

relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by a school bus infraction detection
system; creating a rebuttable presumption that the driver
of a vehicle at the time of a violation recorded by a school
bus infraction detection system is the registered owner of
the vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or its agents from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an

7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing the board of trustees of a school district to
8 allow for the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system in
9 school buses owned by the school district to enforce existing provisions of law
10 prohibiting a driver of any vehicle from overtaking or passing a school bus which:

17 vehicle at the time of a violation detected by a school bus infraction detection
18 system is the registered owner of the vehicle and provides a method for rebutting
19 this presumption. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that a violation detected by a
20 school bus infraction detection system is not a moving traffic violation.
21 Sections 1 and 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
22 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system from the assessment
23 of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for
24 violations detected by a school bus infraction detection system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
13 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by a school bus
14 infraction detection system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
15 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
16 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
17 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
18 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
19 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
20 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
21 months.
22 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
23 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
24 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
25 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
-
*AB527*

– 3 –
1 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
2 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
3 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
4 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
5 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
6 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
7 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
8 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated

10 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
11 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
12 thereto a new section to read as follows:
13 1. A board of trustees of a school district may authorize the

16 of NRS 484B.353.
17 2. The board of trustees of a school district that authorizes
18 the installation and use of a school bus infraction detection system
19 shall enter into an agreement with a traffic enforcement agency

21 equipped with a school bus infraction detection system operates to
22 review the evidence of any alleged infraction of NRS 484B.353
23 recorded by the school bus infraction detection system.
24 3. If, after reviewing the evidence recorded by a school bus
25 infraction detection system, a peace officer of a traffic
26 enforcement agency determines that a violation of NRS 484B.353
27 occurred in a location over which the traffic enforcement agency
28 has jurisdiction, the peace officer shall cause a civil infraction
29 citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7033 for the violation
30 to be sent by the traffic enforcement agency by first class mail to
31 the address listed with the Department for the registered owner of
32 the vehicle identified by the school bus infraction detection system.
33 4. In addition to the information required by subsection 1 of
34 NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
35 484A.7033 for a violation described in subsection 3 must include:

37 (b) An image taken by the school bus infraction detection
38 system showing the vehicle involved in the violation or the address
39 of the Internet website on which such an image may be viewed;

43 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation of NRS 484B.353
44 which was recorded by a school bus infraction detection system.
45 This presumption may be rebutted if the registered owner of the
-
*AB527*

– 4 –
1 vehicle presents an affidavit as evidence at a hearing held
2 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704 stating:

11 officer from issuing a traffic citation for a violation of any law of

17 infraction detection system for the same violation for which the
18 peace officer issued the person the traffic citation.

28 used as evidence of a violation of NRS 484B.353 by the driver of
29 the vehicle.
30 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of
32 this act, a governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use
33 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to
34 be used for the issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction
35 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of chapters
36 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
37 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer,
38 the equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently
39 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency or the
40 equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental entity.
41 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS
43 484A.700 [,] or section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer

8 requests information from a traffic enforcement agency concerning
9 that person’s record of prior offenses, the police officer shall
10 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
11 driver’s license and physical description with any information
12 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
13 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
14 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
15 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional
16 information used for comparison also connects the driver with that
17 prior offense.
18 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction

31 through the Internet or other electronic means.
32 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to
33 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
34 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond by
35 requesting in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
36 electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
37 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing,
38 but the date of the hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days
39 after the court provides notice of the hearing.
40 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less
41 than 30 days before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil
42 infraction citation, the court must send to the address or electronic
43 mail address of the person, as indicated on the civil infraction
44 citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
45 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after

3 text message, the court may send such a notice to the telephone
4 number of the person as indicated on the civil infraction citation. If

8 must enter an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the
9 person committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary
10 penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil
11 infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation
12 and who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required
13 by this section may not appeal an order entered pursuant to this
14 section.
15 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear
16 at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter
17 an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person
18 committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty
19 and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction. A
20 person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails
21 to appear at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not
22 appeal an order entered pursuant to this subsection.
23 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is
24 found by the court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to
25 subsection 5 shall pay the witness fees, per diem allowances, travel
26 expenses and other reimbursement in accordance with NRS 50.225.
27 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS
28 484A.615, any person issued a civil infraction citation may, if
29 authorized by the court, use the system to perform any applicable
30 actions pursuant to this section.
31 Sec. 6. NRS 484B.353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 484B.353 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
33 the driver of any vehicle, when meeting or overtaking, from either
34 direction, any school bus, equipped with signs and signals required
35 by law, which has stopped to receive or discharge any pupil and is
36 displaying a flashing red light signal visible from the front and rear,
37 shall bring the vehicle to an immediate stop and shall not attempt to
38 overtake or proceed past the school bus until the flashing red signal
