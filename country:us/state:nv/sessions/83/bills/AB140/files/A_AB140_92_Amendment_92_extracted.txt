EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to driver authorization cards; revising provisions governing the
renewal of driver authorization cards; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who is not eligible for a driver’s license in this State to
2 apply instead for a driver authorization card. Existing law provides that a driver authorization
3 card expires on the fourth anniversary of the holder’s birthday, measured from the birthday
4 nearest the date of issuance or renewal. (NRS 483.291) Existing law provides that a driver’s
5 license expires as prescribed by regulations adopted by the Department of Motor Vehicles.
6 (NRS 483.380) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill change the expiration date of a driver
7 authorization card so that, instead of every four years, a driver authorization card expires as
8 prescribed by regulations adopted by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 2 requires
9 the Department to adopt such regulations. Section 2 also requires that, to the extent consistent
10 with federal law, the regulations adopted by the Department must ensure that the period
11 between the issuance and expiration of a driver authorization card is equal to the period
12 between the issuance and expiration of a driver’s license.
