Assembly Bill No. 140– Assemblymembers
González; and Hunt
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to driver authorization cards; revising provisions
governing the renewal of driver authorization cards; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a person who is not eligible for a driver’s license in this
State to apply instead for a driver authorization card. Existing law provides that a
driver authorization card expires on the fourth anniversary of the holder’s birthday,
measured from the birthday nearest the date of issuance or renewal. (NRS 483.291)
Existing law provides that a driver’s license expires as prescribed by regulations
adopted by the Department of Motor Vehicles. (NRS 483.380) Sections 1 and 2 of
this bill change the expiration date of a driver authorization card so that, instead of
every four years, a driver authorization card expires as prescribed by regulations
adopted by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 2 requires the Department
to adopt such regulations. Section 2 also requires that, to the extent consistent with
federal law, the regulations adopted by the Department must ensure that the period
between the issuance and expiration of a driver authorization card is equal to the
period between the issuance and expiration of a driver’s license.
