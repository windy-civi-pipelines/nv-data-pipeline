cards. (BDR 43-200)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to driver authorization cards; revising provisions
governing the renewal of driver authorization cards; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who is not eligible for a driver’s license in this
2 State to apply instead for a driver authorization card. Existing law provides that a
3 driver authorization card expires on the fourth anniversary of the holder’s birthday,
4 measured from the birthday nearest the date of issuance or renewal. (NRS 483.291)
5 Existing law provides that a driver’s license expires as prescribed by regulations
6 adopted by the Department of Motor Vehicles. (NRS 483.380) Sections 1 and 2 of
7 this bill change the expiration date of a driver authorization card so that, instead of
8 every four years, a driver authorization card expires as prescribed by regulations
9 adopted by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 2 requires the Department
10 to adopt such regulations. Section 2 also requires that, to the extent consistent with
11 federal law, the regulations adopted by the Department must ensure that the period
12 between the issuance and expiration of a driver authorization card is equal to the
13 period between the issuance and expiration of a driver’s license.
