Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board
2 of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Existing law: (1)
3 requires the State Board to prepare a plan to improve the academic achievement of pupils; and
4 (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan. (NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also
5 requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing bodies of certain
6 charter schools to prepare an annual report of accountability that contains certain information,
7 including, without limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational
8 personnel and paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)
9 Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) requires each public elementary school to prepare a plan to
10 improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary schools; (2) sets
11 forth the required contents of the plan, including, without limitation, certain goals for public
12 elementary schools; and (3) establishes requirements governing the consequences for the
13 principal of a public elementary school that does not meet such goals. Sections 4 [,] and 5
14 [and 58] of this bill make changes regarding the entity required to prepare such a plan
15 pursuant to existing law. (NRS 385.111)
16 Section 1.7 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of schools of
17 a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized to modify, suspend
18 or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district to report information or data
19 that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide information or data that is used by the
20 Department, the State Board or any other person or entity to support educational outcomes.
21 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education for
22 the purpose of developing a statewide vision and implementation plan to improve public
23 education in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 5.5 of this bill revises the duties of the
24 Commission.
25 Section 6.1 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
26 information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to existing law
27 and section 1.3. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain requirements governing
28 the annual report of accountability to the reporting requirements set forth in section 6.1.
29 Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by which teacher vacancies are measured for
30 inclusion in the annual report of accountability.
31 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools that
32 includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school based on the
33 performance of the school and on whether each public school meets the school achievement
34 targets and performance targets established pursuant to the statewide system of accountability.
35 (NRS 385A.600) Sections [6.2, 6.3, 6.4] 6.2-6.4 and 8.5 of this bill establish a similar system
36 of accountability for school districts and charter schools in this State. Section 6.5 of this bill
37 establishes criteria and procedures for the Superintendent to designate a school district or
38 sponsor of a charter school as low-performing or underperforming. Section 9.3 of this bill
39 requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter school
40 designated as underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings;
41 and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit to the Department a school district or
42 sponsor of a charter school performance improvement plan and a school board or sponsor of a
43 charter school improvement plan. Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes the Superintendent to take
44 certain actions if the board of trustees of a school district or sponsor of a charter school does
45 not make adequate progress toward meeting the goals and benchmarks necessary to improve
46 the performance of the school district or charter school. Section 9.7 of this bill requires: (1)
47 the Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter school designated as

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 5
48 underperforming on probation if the designation was based on certain findings relating to the
49 performance of pupils; and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit certain plans to the
50 Superintendent. Section 9.7 also establishes the actions that the Superintendent is authorized
51 to take if the school district or sponsor of a charter school does not make adequate progress
52 toward improving the performance of pupils.
53 Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as low-
54 performing, and sections [14.25-14.65] 14.25-14.4 of this bill prescribe the actions that may
55 be taken with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or persistently
56 underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a process for state
57 intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school that is designated as
58 persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes provisions governing the corrective
59 measure of replacing the principal and key members of the staff of a school. Section 14.4
60 establishes provisions governing the corrective measure of the direct management of a school
61 by the Department. Section 56.5 of this bill: (1) creates the Education Service Center; (2)
62 provides for the appointment of a governing body for the Center; and (3) requires the Center
63 to provide certain assistance and guidance to public schools and school districts that are
64 experiencing low performance.
65 Section 9.3 requires the Superintendent to place certain underperforming school districts
66 or sponsors of charter schools on probation.
67 Section 84.5 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to, in preparing the Nevada
68 Revised Statutes, substitute the term: (1) “focus” for the term “low-performing” as
69 previously used in reference to a low-performing school district, sponsor of a charter
70 school or school; and (2) “priority” for the term “underperforming” as previously used
71 in reference to an underperforming school district or sponsor of a charter school or
72 persistently underperforming school. (NRS 220.120)
73 Existing law provides that, on or before December 31 of each year, the board of trustees
74 of each school district and the State Public Charter School Authority is required to prepare for
75 the immediately preceding school year a report of accountability concerning the educational
76 goals and objectives of the school district or charter school. (NRS 385A.070) Sections 7.4
77 and 7.5 of this bill revise certain provisions governing the report.
78 Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such school
79 districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9.1 of this bill
80 provides for the impaneling of a Public Education Oversight Board under certain
81 circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the authority granted to the board of
82 trustees of a school district to take actions necessary to remedy the cause of recommendations
83 submitted by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Section 9.1 additionally sets forth: (1)
84 the membership of the Board; and (2) requirements for meetings of the Board.
85 Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each county school
86 district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only the Clark County School
87 District); (2) provides that four members of such a board of trustees are appointed, nonvoting
88 members; and (3) sets forth requirements for electing officers of any board of trustees of a
89 school district. (NRS 386.120, 386.165, 386.310) Section 10 of this bill: (1) provides that
90 such appointed, nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the
91 prohibition on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
92 bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to serve as
93 officers.
94 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the duties of the
95 Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill requires the Commission to:
96 (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the method of calculating the percentage of
97 at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a third party to verify such methods and to submit a
98 report containing the findings and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62
99 of this bill authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
100 measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions governing the
101 drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure pursuant to section 62.
102 Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an interim study concerning certain
103 subjects relating to school funding.
104 Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and authorizes
105 the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit
106 organizations to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 6
107 387.1277) Existing law additionally requires the Department, to the extent money is available,
108 to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit organizations to
109 support prekindergarten programs. (NRS 387.652) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends
110 eligibility to receive grants to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs to
111 institutions within the Nevada System of Higher Education ; [and private, for-profit
112 organizations;] and (2) expands the categories of children served by such a program. Section
113 13.5 of this bill creates similar provisions for grants to support prekindergarten programs.
114 Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes not
115 exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a variance to a school district
116 that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) [Section 14 of this
117 bill sets forth requirements for the ratio of teachers per administrator in each elementary
118 school within a school district in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
119 only Clark County)]. Section 16 of this bill requires requests for, and reports concerning,
120 variances of requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher to be submitted annually
121 rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
122 change to the timelines for such submissions. (NRS 388.723, 388.725)
123 [Existing law provides certain exceptions to the requirement that a pupil attend a public
124 school in his or her zone of attendance. (NRS 388.040) Section 14.7 of this bill provides for
125 additional exceptions to this requirement. Section 14.65 requires the Department to create a
126 grant program to assist certain eligible pupils in obtaining transportation to a school he or she
127 attends outside of his or her zone of attendance.]
128 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and intensive
129 instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the pupil does not obtain a
130 score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-referenced examination in reading that
131 meets the score prescribed by the State Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) [Section 14.2 of this
132 bill requires: (1) a service provider to register with the school district to be eligible to provide
133 literacy intervention, tutoring and related services to pupils; and (2) such services to be
134 scientifically based and to meet certain criteria.] Section 8.3 of this bill requires the statewide
135 system of accountability for public schools to include, for elementary schools, targets for the
136 proportion of pupils demonstrating adequate proficiency in the subject area of reading and
137 adequate progress to achieving such proficiency.
138 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body
139 of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in an
140 elementary school that includes procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil in reading
141 by using assessments that have been approved by the State Board. (NRS 388.157)
142 Section 15.6 of this bill removes the requirement that such assessments be approved by
143 the State Board thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school district or the
144 governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the plan any valid and
145 reliable standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in reading. This bill also
146 authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing how the
147 results of any assessment used by a school district or charter school to assess proficiency
148 in reading are collected and reported; and (2) prescribe the assessments which must be
149 used in a school district or charter school if no assessment is included in the plan.
150 Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of days in a
151 school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school year to contain at
152 least 4 days of professional development for elementary school staff and prescribes the focus
153 of such professional development.
154 Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to employ a
155 school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive program for school
156 counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each public school located in a
157 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to
158 provide for the availability of a school counselor or an equivalent service.
159 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes the
160 membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law additionally sets forth
161 the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter school and amending a charter
162 contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276, 388A.279) Existing law further requires the
163 sponsor of a charter school to submit a report containing certain information to the
164 Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section 20 of this bill changes the membership of the
165 Authority. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 7
166 object to the placement of a proposed charter school. Sections [21-23] 21 and 23 of this bill
167 revise certain requirements relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter
168 school; (2) the review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration of
169 such an application. Section 25 of this bill requires the Authority to take certain actions
170 regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it sponsors. Section
171 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a charter school to include a
172 description of the expenditures and sources of all revenues for the charter school.
173 Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the charter
174 contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school
175 receives certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 years out
176 of any 5 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) Section 25.3 of this bill: (1) instead provides
177 that the sponsor of a charter school is required to terminate the charter contract or
178 restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school receives
179 certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 consecutive
180 years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on using the rating of a charter school issued
181 for any school year before the 2015-2016 school year for making such a determination.
182 Sections 25.3 and 25.5 of this bill also provide that, until October 1, 2027, the sponsor of
183 such a charter school is not required to terminate the charter contract or restart the
184 charter school under a new charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of
185 accountability for public schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases
186 a rating from the immediately preceding school year by a certain percentage.
187 Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction at a
188 charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS 388A.518)
189 Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any teacher who provides
190 instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or endorsement. Section 27 of this bill
191 provides that the governing body of a charter school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of
192 pupils if the rules are not more restrictive than those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional
193 public schools, thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing body of a
194 charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS 392.130-
195 392.220)
196 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this State which
197 has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
198 School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS 388G.530, 388G.600) Under
199 existing law, a local school precinct is required to operate using site-based decision-making in
200 which certain responsibilities are transferred from the large school district to the local school
201 precinct. (NRS 388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections [33.2-33.7]
202 33.2-33.54 and 33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect this change. Sections
203 33.57-33.59 of this bill revise provisions governing certain duties of the superintendent of
204 schools of a large school district.
205 Existing law: (1) authorizes a local school precinct to carry forward its year-end
206 balance to the next school year for use by the local school precinct; and (2) requires a
207 local school precinct that carries forward a balance that exceeds 5 percent of its actual
208 expenditures to use the money for certain purposes. (NRS 388G.650) Section 33.56 of
209 this bill authorizes a large school district to intervene to require a local school precinct to
210 spend any money carried forward for certain purposes.
211 Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an organizational team
212 for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the position of principal for a local
213 school precinct (NRS 388G.740) Section 33.8 of this bill revises these provisions.
214 Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program; (2)
215 establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of a
216 pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a scholarship
217 organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing certain information.
218 (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes certain reporting requirements
219 for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of this bill requires such schools to administer
220 certain examinations and assessments to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each
221 school that receives such a grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section
222 32 of this bill applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections
223 30-31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 8
224 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
225 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections 31.2-31.7
226 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 31.2
227 requires a scholarship organization to register with the Department by submitting certain
228 information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a registered scholarship organization to provide to the
229 Department certain information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant;
230 and (2) the Department to compile certain information submitted by each scholarship
231 organization and review the information to determine whether to recommend a change to the
232 Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5 requires a registered scholarship
233 organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each donation received and prohibits a
234 scholarship organization from carrying forward a donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6
235 requires the Department of Education to: (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship
236 organization registered with the Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations
237 registered with the Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a
238 summary of certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
239 Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a scholarship
240 organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which a scholarship
241 organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a scholarship organization
242 to establish written procedures for determining whether a pupil is qualified to receive a grant
243 and awarding grants on behalf of pupils. Section 31.8 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to
244 the provisions that may be cited as the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
245 Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain limitations
246 on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or assessment; and (2) the
247 number of examinations or assessments administered in a school year. (NRS 390.805) Section
248 35 of this bill establishes additional requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill
249 sets forth certain reporting requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare
250 for and conduct examinations and assessments.
251 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and Retention
252 within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the Commission; and (3)
253 require the Commission to study issues relating to the recruitment and retention of educators
254 in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher
255 and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby
256 dissolving the Task Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
257 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
258 the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the State Board, for licensing
259 teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this
260 bill requires the Commission to establish requirements for a person to obtain a provisional
261 license with an endorsement as a registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization
262 for the State Board to disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections [39,
263 40, 41 and 42] 39-42 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority
264 granted to the State Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of
265 certain reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill requires
266 the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each provider approved by
267 the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training. (NRS 391.039) Section 48 of
268 this bill eliminates the requirement that certain reports concerning a shortage of teachers be
269 submitted to the State Board. (NRS 391.125)
270 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city or
271 county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from sponsoring a new
272 charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an additional campus of an existing
273 charter school sponsored by the city or county if the total number of pupils enrolled in the
274 charter schools sponsored by the city or county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils
275 enrolled in public schools in the city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by
276 the city or county. (NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this bill creates an exception to this
277 prohibition by authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
278 enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city
279 or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the charter schools
280 sponsored by the city or county, if certain conditions are met.
281 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English language arts, as
282 core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools; and (2) requires the Council

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 9
283 to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to adopt standards of content and
284 performance for certain courses of study, including courses in the core academic subjects.
285 (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of this bill makes certain requirements governing the
286 standards and instruction for English language arts. Section 33.93 of this bill requires the
287 Department, to the extent that money is available for such a purpose, to establish a pilot
288 program under which schools or groups of schools may apply to the Department for grants to
289 integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics into instruction in literacy.
290 Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State Board to use the results of the pilot program to
291 determine whether model curriculum for English language arts should include phonics-based
292 instruction and the integration of science, technology, engineering and mathematics into
293 English language arts in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3.
294 Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil and
295 criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical altercations, fights or
296 other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of pupils or other school employees if:
297 (1) the school employee is acting within the course and scope of his or her employment and
298 within the course and scope of his or her role in maintaining order, discipline or the safety of
299 pupils; (2) the actions of the school employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws
300 and the policies of the school district or school at which the school employee is employed; and
301 (3) any harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful, grossly
302 negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to the rights or
303 safety of the person harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this immunity from civil and
304 criminal liability to employees of private schools.
305 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
306 regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational
307 personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a license to teach elementary
308 education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in elementary grades. (NAC 391.090)
309 Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require the Commission to adopt regulations requiring
310 that, to be eligible to teach pupils in kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a
311 teacher is required to obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a
312 course of instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
313 meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the
314 University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the Nevada System of Higher
315 Education to collaborate with the Department and the Commission to establish such courses.
316 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
317 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to serve an
318 additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a period of probation
319 is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no right to employment after any
320 of the three probationary contract years; and (2) during the contract year, the probationary
321 employee may be dismissed after receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS
322 391.820-391.826) Section 52.5 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is
323 serving an additional probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary
324 employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that additional
325 probationary period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may notify the employee
326 that the employee [will] may not be reemployed for the next contract year; or (2) the
327 superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of dismissing the employee
328 during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a school district does not reemploy or dismisses
329 such an employee, the Department is required to provide: (1) the school district with certain
330 assistance in recruiting and hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created;
331 and (2) school leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in
332 managing transitions and improving teaching practices.
333 Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a period of
334 probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a postprobationary teacher is
335 placed on such a period of probation, a performance improvement plan must be established
336 for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to section 38.7 of this bill. Under section 38.8, at
337 the conclusion of the period of probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher
338 must be evaluated. If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate progress
339 toward meeting improvement goals, section 38.8 authorizes the teacher to not be reemployed
340 or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary employee.

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 10
341 Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to sections
342 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track certain data relating
343 to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for school administrators, assess the
344 effectiveness of such programs and make recommendations for the improvement of such
345 programs.
346 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
347 of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the school district or charter school
348 have access to certain professional development training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 56.2 of
349 this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body of each
350 charter school to ensure that teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3,
351 administrators of schools in which such pupils are enrolled, certain other administrators and
352 paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils complete a course of professional
353 development training in the science of reading that is approved by the Department.
354 Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a teacher or
355 other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction a
356 complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission authorizing the Superintendent
357 to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History
358 for its report on the criminal history of the applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau
359 of Investigation (hereinafter “FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant.
360 (NRS 179A.075, 391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an
361 applicant for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
362 the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a report on the
363 criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill authorizes the Central
364 Repository and the Department of Education to participate in the in the Rap Back Program
365 administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the purpose of enabling the
366 Department to obtain ongoing status notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed
367 by the Superintendent. Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for
368 the issuance of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
369 systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the Rap Back
370 Program; and (2) the Central Repository must establish certain methods of handling such
371 fingerprints. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of such criminal history
372 information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in the system when a person is no
373 longer licensed. Section 60 additionally requires the Department to obtain consent from a
374 person before submitting his or her fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under
375 section 83, persons who are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program
376 becomes effective are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the
377 time of the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would not submit
378 fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a conforming change
379 related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that fingerprints for a background
380 check would no longer be submitted with a renewal application when the Rap Back Program
381 becomes effective. (NRS 391.040) Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to
382 remove a requirement for a person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned
383 to employment after certain leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background
384 check because the Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through the
385 Rap Back Program. (NRS 391.104)
386 The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a superintendent of
387 schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school
388 district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
389 Counties) to comply with certain requirements when hiring a superintendent of schools.
390 Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance evaluation
391 system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation of probationary
392 teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how pupil growth is calculated for
393 the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this bill revises the observation cycles for
394 probationary teachers.
395 Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational growth, rather
396 than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480) Section 51 of this bill makes
397 a conforming change to reflect the change made in section 50.
398 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a program
399 of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and retention of licensed

Assembly Amendment No. 976 to Senate Bill No. 460 First Reprint Page 11
400 teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of this bill requires each large
401 school district to establish through negotiations with an employee organization a differential
402 pay scale for certain licensed educational personnel assigned to certain Title I schools. Section
403 56 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each
404 fiscal year an amount of money sufficient to provide such a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill
405 defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of this bill
406 requires the differential pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory collective bargaining.
407 Section 79 of this bill clarifies the manner in which the provisions of section 55 applies to any
408 existing contracts.
409 Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional development of
410 teachers and administrators to provide certain training for educational personnel. (NRS
411 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for such training.
412 Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
413 establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose duties are
414 prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59 of this bill requires the Board of
415 Regents, in consultation with the Department, to develop a method for sharing with the
416 Department certain numbers used for the identification of students.
417 [Section 80 of this bill directs the Commission on School Funding to perform certain
418 tasks concerning the examination of resource levels and funding levels that represent the best
419 practices for adequately meeting the needs of pupils.]
420 Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System of Higher
421 Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for assessing the
422 competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative assessment methods; and
423 (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
424 Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a summary of
425 a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS 354.6015) Section 67 of
426 this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of trustees of school districts.
427 Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by the Labor
428 Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with the advice and guidance of
429 the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110, 610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill
430 create the Nevada Registered Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada
431 Registered Teacher Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the
432 State Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
433 Sections 71-78.8 of this bill make certain appropriations for various purposes related to
434 education.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

23 school improvement.
24 (b) Assess the performance of the principal of the public school and his or
25 her responsibility for the failure of the school to meet the goals set forth pursuant
26 to paragraph (b) of subsection 1. The superintendent of schools of the school
27 district or the executive director of the charter school may, to assess the
28 performance of the principal pursuant to this paragraph, consider the rate of
29 chronic absenteeism, as defined by the Department pursuant to subsection 3 of
30 NRS 392.150, at the public school. If the superintendent or executive director of
31 the charter school determines that the principal is ineffective and responsible for
32 the failure, the [superintendent or executive director, as applicable:

19 Sec. 1.7. 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
20 (a) Enhance the efficiency of education reporting requirements by
21 eliminating the reporting of redundant information and data, reducing
22 administrative burdens and ensuring that all reports serve a meaningful purpose
23 in supporting educational outcomes.
24 (b) Ensure that teachers and school administrators, who are directly
25 impacted by reporting requirements, have agency in recommending modifications
26 to reporting requirements.
27 (c) Preserve transparency, the accountability of public schools and school
28 districts for the quality of schools and the educational achievement of pupils, and
29 the accessibility of information and data concerning the educational achievement
30 of pupils.
31 2. A teacher or school administrator employed at a public school, a charter
32 management organization that operates a charter school or an educational
33 management organization that provides support or operations to a charter school
34 may submit a petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public
35 school or school district to report information or data to another person or entity.
36 Such a petition must be submitted to the superintendent of schools of the school
37 district in which the public school is located or, if the public school is a charter

7 is duplicative or redundant or does not provide data that is used by the school
8 district to support educational outcomes, approve the petition and issue a decision
9 modifying, eliminating or suspending the requirement. If the superintendent of
10 schools of the school district issues such a decision, the superintendent shall
11 provide notice of the approval of the petition to the petitioner, each public school
12 within the school district and any other person or entity affected by the
13 modification, suspension or elimination of the reporting requirement. If the

32 governing body of the charter school, as applicable, or resubmit the petition with
33 additional information.
34 4. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall evaluate each petition
35 forwarded to the Department pursuant to subsection 3 and, as part of such an
36 evaluation, consider:
37 (a) Any information provided by the petitioner, including, without limitation,
38 any statements of support from school leadership, governing bodies, teachers or
39 other educational personnel;
40 (b) The necessity of the reporting requirement for compliance with federal or
41 state law;
42 (c) Whether the information or data that is reported is available through
43 other means or reporting mechanisms;
44 (d) The administrative burden imposed by the reporting requirement, with a
45 focus on enabling teachers and administrators to allocate their time efficiently to
46 activities that support pupil learning; and
47 (e) The potential impact of the modification, suspension or elimination of the
48 reporting requirement on transparency, the accountability of public schools and
49 school districts for the quality of schools and the educational achievement of
50 pupils, and the accessibility of information and data concerning the educational
51 achievement of pupils.
52 5. Not later than 180 days after receiving a petition for evaluation pursuant
53 to subsection 4, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall approve the

1 petition, deny the petition or request additional information or revisions to the
2 petition. If the Superintendent requests additional information or revisions to the
3 petition, the Superintendent shall, not later than 90 days after receiving such
4 additional information or revisions, approve or deny the petition.
5 6. If, after conducting an evaluation of a petition pursuant to subsection 4,
6 the Superintendent of Public Instruction finds that the requirement to report data
7 or information proposed for modification, suspension or elimination is
8 duplicative or redundant or does not provide data or information that is used by
9 the Department, the State Board or any other person or entity to support
10 educational outcomes, the Superintendent may issue an order modifying,
11 suspending or eliminating the requirement. If the Superintendent of Public
12 Instruction denies the petition, the Superintendent shall provide notice of the
13 denial and a written explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner
14 and the superintendent of schools of the school district or governing body of the
15 charter school, as applicable, that forwarded the petition to the Department
16 pursuant to subsection 3. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction issues an
17 order modifying, suspending or eliminating a reporting requirement pursuant to
18 this subsection, the Superintendent shall:
19 (a) Provide notice of the order to the petitioner, the superintendent of schools
20 of the school district or the governing body of the charter school that forwarded
21 the petition to the Department pursuant to subsection 3 and any other person or
22 entity affected by the modification, suspension or elimination of the reporting
23 requirement.
24 (b) Submit a report to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
25 transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education or, if the
26 Legislature is in session at the time notice is provided pursuant to paragraph (a),
27 to the Senate and Assembly Standing Committees on Education, which describes
28 the reporting requirement modified, suspended or eliminated and any
29 recommendations for legislation to continue the modification, suspension or
30 elimination of the reporting requirement after the expiration of the order.
31 7. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if, pursuant to this section,
32 the superintendent of schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public
33 Instruction issues a decision or order modifying, suspending or eliminating a
34 requirement to report data or information, each person or entity to whom the
35 requirement applies shall comply with the decision of the superintendent of
36 schools of the school district or the order of the Superintendent of Public
37 Instruction, as applicable, until the expiration of the decision or order. Any
38 decision or order issued pursuant to this section expires on July 1 of the next
39 odd-numbered year following its issuance.
40 8. The superintendent of schools of each school district and the governing
41 body of each charter school shall report to the Department in a standardized
42 format prescribed by the Department any information required by the
43 Department to complete the reporting of information required by subsection 9
44 concerning petitions submitted by teachers and school administrators pursuant to

18 section.
19 Sec. 2. NRS 385.111 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 385.111 1. The [State Board] Department shall prepare a plan to improve
21 the achievement of pupils enrolled in the public schools in this State. The plan:
22 (a) Must be prepared in consultation with:
23 (1) Employees of the Department [;] and members of the State Board;
24 (2) At least one employee of a school district in a county whose population
25 is 100,000 or more, appointed by the Nevada Association of School Boards;
26 (3) At least one employee of a school district in a county whose population
