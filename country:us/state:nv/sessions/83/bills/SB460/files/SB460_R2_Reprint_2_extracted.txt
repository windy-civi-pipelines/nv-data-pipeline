Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Department of Education, which consists of the
2 State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS
3 385.010) Existing law: (1) requires the State Board to prepare a plan to improve the
4 academic achievement of pupils; and (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan.
5 (NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also requires the board of trustees of each
6 school district and the governing bodies of certain charter schools to prepare an
7 annual report of accountability that contains certain information, including, without
8 limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational personnel and
9 paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)
10 Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) requires each public elementary school to prepare a
11 plan to improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary
12 schools; (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan, including, without
13 limitation, certain goals for public elementary schools; and (3) establishes
14 requirements governing the consequences for the principal of a public elementary
15 school that does not meet such goals. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill make changes
16 regarding the entity required to prepare such a plan pursuant to existing law.
17 (NRS 385.111)
18 Section 1.7 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
19 schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
20 to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
21 to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
22 information or data that is used by the Department, the State Board or any other
23 person or entity to support educational outcomes.
24 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
25 Education for the purpose of developing a statewide vision and implementation
26 plan to improve public education in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 5.5 of this
27 bill revises the duties of the Commission.
28 Section 6.1 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
29 information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to
30 existing law and section 1.3. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain
31 requirements governing the annual report of accountability to the reporting
-
*SB460_R2*
– 3 –
32 requirements set forth in section 6.1. Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by
33 which teacher vacancies are measured for inclusion in the annual report of
34 accountability.
35 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
36 that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
37 based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
38 the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
39 statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 6.2-6.4 and 8.5 of
40 this bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts and charter
41 schools in this State. Section 6.5 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for
42 the Superintendent to designate a school district or sponsor of a charter school as
43 low-performing or underperforming. Section 9.3 of this bill requires: (1) the
44 Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter school designated
45 as underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings; and
46 (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit to the Department a school district or
47 sponsor of a charter school performance improvement plan and a school board or
48 sponsor of a charter school improvement plan. Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes the
49 Superintendent to take certain actions if the board of trustees of a school district or
50 sponsor of a charter school does not make adequate progress toward meeting the
51 goals and benchmarks necessary to improve the performance of the school district
52 or charter school. Section 9.7 of this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a
53 school district or sponsor of a charter school designated as underperforming on
54 probation if the designation was based on certain findings relating to the
55 performance of pupils; and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit certain
56 plans to the Superintendent. Section 9.7 also establishes the actions that the
57 Superintendent is authorized to take if the school district or sponsor of a charter
58 school does not make adequate progress toward improving the performance of
59 pupils.
60 Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as
61 low-performing, and sections 14.25-14.4 of this bill prescribe the actions that may
62 be taken with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or
63 persistently underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a
64 process for state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school
65 that is designated as persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes
66 provisions governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key
67 members of the staff of a school. Section 14.4 establishes provisions governing the
68 corrective measure of the direct management of a school by the Department.
69 Section 56.5 of this bill: (1) creates the Education Service Center; (2) provides for
70 the appointment of a governing body for the Center; and (3) requires the Center to
71 provide certain assistance and guidance to public schools and school districts that
72 are experiencing low performance.
73 Section 9.3 requires the Superintendent to place certain underperforming
74 school districts or sponsors of charter schools on probation.
75 Section 84.5 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to, in preparing the
76 Nevada Revised Statutes, substitute the term: (1) “focus” for the term “low-
77 performing” as previously used in reference to a low-performing school district,
78 sponsor of a charter school or school; and (2) “priority” for the term
79 “underperforming” as previously used in reference to an underperforming school
80 district or sponsor of a charter school or persistently underperforming school.
81 (NRS 220.120)
82 Existing law provides that, on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
83 trustees of each school district and the State Public Charter School Authority is
84 required to prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of
85 accountability concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district

86 or charter school. (NRS 385A.070) Sections 7.4 and 7.5 of this bill revise certain
87 provisions governing the report.
88 Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such
89 school districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9.1
90 of this bill provides for the impaneling of a Public Education Oversight Board
91 under certain circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the
92 authority granted to the board of trustees of a school district to take actions
93 necessary to remedy the cause of recommendations submitted by the
94 Superintendent of Public Instruction. Section 9.1 additionally sets forth: (1) the
95 membership of the Board; and (2) requirements for meetings of the Board.
96 Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each
97 county school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only
98 the Clark County School District); (2) provides that four members of such a board
99 of trustees are appointed, nonvoting members; and (3) sets forth requirements for
100 electing officers of any board of trustees of a school district. (NRS 386.120,
101 386.165, 386.310) Section 10 of this bill: (1) provides that such appointed,
102 nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the prohibition
103 on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
104 bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to
105 serve as officers.
106 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
107 duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill
108 requires the Commission to: (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the
109 method of calculating the percentage of at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a
110 third party to verify such methods and to submit a report containing the findings
111 and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62 of this bill
112 authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
113 measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions
114 governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
115 pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an
116 interim study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
117 Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and
118 authorizes the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter
119 schools and nonprofit organizations to support early childhood literacy and
120 readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-387.1277) Existing law additionally requires
121 the Department, to the extent money is available, to award grants to school districts,
122 sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit organizations to support prekindergarten
123 programs. (NRS 387.652) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends eligibility to receive
124 grants to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs to institutions
125 within the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (2) expands the categories of
126 children served by such a program. Section 13.5 of this bill creates similar
127 provisions for grants to support prekindergarten programs.
128 Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain
129 classes not exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a
130 variance to a school district that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school
131 year. (NRS 388.700). Section 16 of this bill requires requests for, and reports
132 concerning, variances of requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher to
133 be submitted annually rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make
134 conforming changes to reflect the change to the timelines for such submissions.
135 (NRS 388.723, 388.725)
136 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
137 intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
138 pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
139 referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
140 Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Section 8.3 of this bill requires the statewide
-
*SB460_R2*
– 5 –
141 system of accountability for public schools to include, for elementary schools,
142 targets for the proportion of pupils demonstrating adequate proficiency in the
143 subject area of reading and adequate progress to achieving such proficiency.
144 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
145 body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
146 in an elementary school that includes procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil
147 in reading by using assessments that have been approved by the State Board. (NRS
148 388.157) Section 15.6 of this bill removes the requirement that such assessments be
149 approved by the State Board thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school
150 district or the governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the
151 plan any valid and reliable standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in
152 reading. This bill also authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt
153 regulations prescribing how the results of any assessment used by a school district
154 or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2)
155 prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school district or charter school
156 if no assessment is included in the plan.
157 Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of
158 days in a school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school
159 year to contain at least 4 days of professional development for elementary school
160 staff and prescribes the focus of such professional development.
161 Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to
162 employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive
163 program for school counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each
164 public school located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
165 Clark and Washoe Counties) to provide for the availability of a school counselor or
166 an equivalent service.
167 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes
168 the membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law
169 additionally sets forth the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter
170 school and amending a charter contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276,
171 388A.279) Existing law further requires the sponsor of a charter school to submit a
172 report containing certain information to the Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section
173 20 of this bill changes the membership of the Authority. Section 19 of this bill
174 authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to object to the placement
175 of a proposed charter school. Sections 21 and 23 of this bill revise certain
176 requirements relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter school;
177 (2) the review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration
178 of such an application. Section 25 of this bill requires the Authority to take certain
179 actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it
180 sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a
181 charter school to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all
182 revenues for the charter school.
183 Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the
184 charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the
185 charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter
186 school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) Section 25.3 of
187 this bill: (1) instead provides that the sponsor of a charter school is required to
188 terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter
189 contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance
190 of the charter school in 3 consecutive years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on
191 using the rating of a charter school issued for any school year before the 2015-2016
192 school year for making such a determination. Sections 25.3 and 25.5 of this bill
193 also provide that, until October 1, 2027, the sponsor of such a charter school is not
194 required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
195 charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public
-
*SB460_R2*
– 6 –
196 schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from the
197 immediately preceding school year by a certain percentage.
198 Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction
199 at a charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS
200 388A.518) Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any
201 teacher who provides instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or
202 endorsement. Section 27 of this bill provides that the governing body of a charter
203 school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of pupils if the rules are not more
204 restrictive than those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional public schools,
205 thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing body of a
206 charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS
207 392.130-392.220)
208 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this
209 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
210 the Clark County School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS
211 388G.530, 388G.600) Under existing law, a local school precinct is required to
212 operate using site-based decision-making in which certain responsibilities are
213 transferred from the large school district to the local school precinct. (NRS
214 388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 33.2-33.54 and
215 33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect this change. Sections 33.57-
216 33.59 of this bill revise provisions governing certain duties of the superintendent of
217 schools of a large school district.
218 Existing law: (1) authorizes a local school precinct to carry forward its year-end
219 balance to the next school year for use by the local school precinct; and (2) requires
220 a local school precinct that carries forward a balance that exceeds 5 percent of its
221 actual expenditures to use the money for certain purposes. (NRS 388G.650)
222 Section 33.56 of this bill authorizes a large school district to intervene to require a
223 local school precinct to spend any money carried forward for certain purposes.
224 Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an
225 organizational team for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the
226 position of principal for a local school precinct (NRS 388G.740) Section 33.8 of
227 this bill revises these provisions.
228 Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
229 (2) establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on
230 behalf of a pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a
231 scholarship organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing
232 certain information. (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes
233 certain reporting requirements for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of
234 this bill requires such schools to administer certain examinations and assessments
235 to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each school that receives such a
236 grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section 32 of this bill
237 applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections 30-
238 31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)
239 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
240 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections
241 31.2-31.7 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
242 Statutes. Section 31.2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
243 Department by submitting certain information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a
244 registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department certain
245 information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and (2) the
246 Department to compile certain information submitted by each scholarship
247 organization and review the information to determine whether to recommend a
248 change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5 requires
249 a registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
250 donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
-
*SB460_R2*
– 7 –
251 donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6 requires the Department of Education
252 to: (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
253 Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
254 Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a summary
255 of certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
256 Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
257 scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
258 a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a
259 scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
260 pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.
261 Section 31.8 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to the provisions that may be cited
262 as the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
263 Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain
264 limitations on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or
265 assessment; and (2) the number of examinations or assessments administered in a
266 school year. (NRS 390.805) Section 35 of this bill establishes additional
267 requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain reporting
268 requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare for and conduct
269 examinations and assessments.
270 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and
271 Retention within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the
272 Commission; and (3) require the Commission to study issues relating to the
273 recruitment and retention of educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals
274 provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher and Education Support Professional
275 Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby dissolving the Task
276 Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
277 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
278 and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the
279 State Board, for licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011,
280 391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this bill requires the Commission to establish
281 requirements for a person to obtain a provisional license with an endorsement as a
282 registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization for the State Board to
283 disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections 39-42 of this bill
284 make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority granted to the State
285 Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of certain
286 reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill
287 requires the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each
288 provider approved by the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training.
289 (NRS 391.039) Section 48 of this bill eliminates the requirement that certain
290 reports concerning a shortage of teachers be submitted to the State Board.
291 (NRS 391.125)
292 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
293 or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
294 sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
295 additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
296 the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
297 county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
298 city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
299 (NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
300 authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
301 enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
302 by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
303 charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if certain conditions are met.
304 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
305 language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
-
*SB460_R2*
– 8 –
306 and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
307 adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
308 courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of
309 this bill makes certain requirements governing the standards and instruction for
310 English language arts. Section 33.93 of this bill requires the Department, to the
311 extent that money is available for such a purpose, to establish a pilot program under
312 which schools or groups of schools may apply to the Department for grants to
313 integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics into instruction in
314 literacy. Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State Board to use the results of the
315 pilot program to determine whether model curriculum for English language arts
316 should include phonics-based instruction and the integration of science, technology,
317 engineering and mathematics into English language arts in kindergarten and grades
318 1, 2 and 3.
319 Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
320 and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
321 altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
322 pupils or other school employees if: (1) the school employee is acting within the
323 course and scope of his or her employment and within the course and scope of his
324 or her role in maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of
325 the school employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the
326 policies of the school district or school at which the school employee is employed;
327 and (3) any harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful,
328 grossly negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to
329 the rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this
330 immunity from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
331 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
332 to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
333 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a
334 license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in
335 elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require
336 the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
337 kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
338 obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
339 instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
340 meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
341 the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the Nevada System
342 of Higher Education to collaborate with the Department and the Commission to
343 establish such courses.
344 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
345 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
346 serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
347 period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
348 right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
349 during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
350 receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section
351 52.5 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an
352 additional probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary
353 employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that
354 additional probationary period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may
355 notify the employee that the employee may not be reemployed for the next contract
356 year; or (2) the superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of
357 dismissing the employee during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a school
358 district does not reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is
359 required to provide: (1) the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and
360 hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school

361 leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in
362 managing transitions and improving teaching practices.
363 Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
364 period of probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a
365 postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a performance
366 improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to
367 section 38.7 of this bill. Under section 38.8, at the conclusion of the period of
368 probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must be evaluated.
369 If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate progress toward
370 meeting improvement goals, section 38.8 authorizes the teacher to not be
371 reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary employee.
372 Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
373 sections 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track
374 certain data relating to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for
375 school administrators, assess the effectiveness of such programs and make
376 recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
377 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
378 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
379 school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
380 training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 56.2 of this bill requires the board of trustees of
381 each school district and the governing body of each charter school to ensure that
382 teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of
383 schools in which such pupils are enrolled, certain other administrators and
384 paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils complete a course of professional
385 development training in the science of reading that is approved by the Department.
386 Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a
387 teacher or other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of
388 Public Instruction a complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission
389 authorizing the Superintendent to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository
390 for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal history of the
391 applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
392 “FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 179A.075,
393 391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an applicant
394 for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
395 the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a
396 report on the criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill
397 authorizes the Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in
398 the in the Rap Back Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
399 (FBI) for the purpose of enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status
400 notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed by the Superintendent.
401 Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for the issuance of
402 a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
403 systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the
404 Rap Back Program; and (2) the Central Repository must establish certain methods
405 of handling such fingerprints. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of
406 such criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in
407 the system when a person is no longer licensed. Section 60 additionally requires the
408 Department to obtain consent from a person before submitting his or her
409 fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under section 83, persons who
410 are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes
411 effective are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the
412 time of the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would
413 not submit fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a
414 conforming change related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that
415 fingerprints for a background check would no longer be submitted with a renewal
-
*SB460_R2*
– 10 –
416 application when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS 391.040)
417 Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a
418 person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment
419 after certain leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check
420 because the Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through
421 the Rap Back Program. (NRS 391.104)
422 The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a
423 superintendent of schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board
424 of trustees of a school district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
425 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to comply with certain requirements
426 when hiring a superintendent of schools.
427 Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance
428 evaluation system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation
429 of probationary teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how
430 pupil growth is calculated for the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this
431 bill revises the observation cycles for probationary teachers.
432 Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational
433 growth, rather than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480)
434 Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the change made in
435 section 50.
436 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
437 program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
438 retention of licensed teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of
439 this bill requires each large school district to establish through negotiations with an
440 employee organization a differential pay scale for certain licensed educational
441 personnel assigned to certain Title I schools. Section 56 of this bill requires the
442 board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each fiscal year an
443 amount of money sufficient to provide such a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill
444 defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of
445 this bill requires the differential pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory
446 collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill clarifies the manner in which the
447 provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
448 Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional
449 development of teachers and administrators to provide certain training for
450 educational personnel. (NRS 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain
451 requirements for such training.
452 Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to
453 provide for the establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of
454 Regents whose duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59
455 of this bill requires the Board of Regents, in consultation with the Department, to
456 develop a method for sharing with the Department certain numbers used for the
457 identification of students.
458 Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System
459 of Higher Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for
460 assessing the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative
461 assessment methods; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
462 Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a
463 summary of a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS
464 354.6015) Section 67 of this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of
465 trustees of school districts.
466 Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by
467 the Labor Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with
468 the advice and guidance of the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110,
469 610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill create the Nevada Registered
470 Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada Registered Teacher
-
*SB460_R2*
– 11 –
471 Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the State
472 Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
473 Sections 71-78.8 of this bill make certain appropriations for various purposes
474 related to education.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 385 of NRS is hereby amended by adding

7 which the public elementary school is located or, if the public
8 elementary school is a charter school, the sponsor of the charter
9 school. The plan must comply with the requirements of the Every
10 Student Succeeds Act of 2015, 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq., and

13 meet the goals set forth pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1.
14 The superintendent of schools of the school district or the
15 executive director of the charter school may, to assess the
16 performance of the principal pursuant to this paragraph, consider
17 the rate of chronic absenteeism, as defined by the Department
18 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 392.150, at the public school. If
19 the superintendent or executive director of the charter school
20 determines that the principal is ineffective and responsible for the
21 failure, the board of trustees must, except as otherwise provided in

27 position pursuant to paragraph (b), the principal must reapply to
28 the board of trustees of the school district for his or her current
29 position.
30 4. A principal who is the subject of a performance assessment

20 Sec. 1.7. 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
21 (a) Enhance the efficiency of education reporting
22 requirements by eliminating the reporting of redundant
23 information and data, reducing administrative burdens and
24 ensuring that all reports serve a meaningful purpose in supporting
25 educational outcomes.
26 (b) Ensure that teachers and school administrators, who are
27 directly impacted by reporting requirements, have agency in
28 recommending modifications to reporting requirements.
29 (c) Preserve transparency, the accountability of public schools
30 and school districts for the quality of schools and the educational
31 achievement of pupils, and the accessibility of information and
32 data concerning the educational achievement of pupils.
33 2. A teacher or school administrator employed at a public
34 school, a charter management organization that operates a
35 charter school or an educational management organization that
36 provides support or operations to a charter school may submit a
37 petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public
38 school or school district to report information or data to another
39 person or entity. Such a petition must be submitted to the
40 superintendent of schools of the school district in which the public
41 school is located or, if the public school is a charter school, the
42 governing body of the charter school. The petition must:
43 (a) Clearly identify the requirement to report information or
44 data that the petitioner is seeking to modify, suspend or eliminate;

6 (c) Propose an alternative report of information or data, if any,
7 that would ensure that information and data to support

10 2, the superintendent of schools of the school district or governing
11 body of the charter school, as applicable, shall:
12 (a) Review the petition to determine whether the requirement
13 to report data or information that is proposed for modification,

17 outcomes.
18 (b) If the petition requests to modify, suspend or eliminate a

23 or redundant or does not provide data that is used by the school
24 district to support educational outcomes, approve the petition and
25 issue a decision modifying, eliminating or suspending the
26 requirement. If the superintendent of schools of the school district
27 issues such a decision, the superintendent shall provide notice of
28 the approval of the petition to the petitioner, each public school
29 within the school district and any other person or entity affected
30 by the modification, suspension or elimination of the reporting
31 requirement. If the superintendent of public schools of the school
32 district denies a petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a
33 requirement for a public school to report data or information to
34 the school district, the superintendent shall provide a written
35 explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner. A
36 petitioner whose petition is denied pursuant to this paragraph may

9 school, as applicable, or resubmit the petition with additional
10 information.
11 4. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall evaluate
12 each petition forwarded to the Department pursuant to subsection
13 3 and, as part of such an evaluation, consider:
14 (a) Any information provided by the petitioner, including,
15 without limitation, any statements of support from school
16 leadership, governing bodies, teachers or other educational
17 personnel;
18 (b) The necessity of the reporting requirement for compliance
19 with federal or state law;
20 (c) Whether the information or data that is reported is
21 available through other means or reporting mechanisms;
22 (d) The administrative burden imposed by the reporting
23 requirement, with a focus on enabling teachers and administrators
24 to allocate their time efficiently to activities that support pupil
25 learning; and
26 (e) The potential impact of the modification, suspension or
27 elimination of the reporting requirement on transparency, the
28 accountability of public schools and school districts for the quality
29 of schools and the educational achievement of pupils, and the
30 accessibility of information and data concerning the educational
31 achievement of pupils.
32 5. Not later than 180 days after receiving a petition for
33 evaluation pursuant to subsection 4, the Superintendent of Public
34 Instruction shall approve the petition, deny the petition or request
35 additional information or revisions to the petition. If the
36 Superintendent requests additional information or revisions to the
37 petition, the Superintendent shall, not later than 90 days after
38 receiving such additional information or revisions, approve or
39 deny the petition.
40 6. If, after conducting an evaluation of a petition pursuant to
41 subsection 4, the Superintendent of Public Instruction finds that
42 the requirement to report data or information proposed for
43 modification, suspension or elimination is duplicative or
44 redundant or does not provide data or information that is used by

5 explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner and the
6 superintendent of schools of the school district or governing body
7 of the charter school, as applicable, that forwarded the petition to
8 the Department pursuant to subsection 3. If the Superintendent of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Department of Education, which consists of the
2 State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS
3 385.010) Existing law: (1) requires the State Board to prepare a plan to improve the
4 academic achievement of pupils; and (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan.
5 (NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also requires the board of trustees of each
6 school district and the governing bodies of certain charter schools to prepare an
7 annual report of accountability that contains certain information, including, without
8 limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational personnel and
9 paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)
10 Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) requires each public elementary school to prepare a
11 plan to improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary
12 schools; (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan, including, without
13 limitation, certain goals for public elementary schools; and (3) establishes
14 requirements governing the consequences for the principal of a public elementary
15 school that does not meet such goals. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill make changes
16 regarding the entity required to prepare such a plan pursuant to existing law.
17 (NRS 385.111)
18 Section 1.7 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
19 schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
20 to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
21 to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
22 information or data that is used by the Department, the State Board or any other
23 person or entity to support educational outcomes.
24 Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
25 Education for the purpose of developing a statewide vision and implementation
26 plan to improve public education in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 5.5 of this
27 bill revises the duties of the Commission.
28 Section 6.1 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
29 information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to
30 existing law and section 1.3. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain
31 requirements governing the annual report of accountability to the reporting
-
*SB460_R2*

– 3 –
32 requirements set forth in section 6.1. Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by
33 which teacher vacancies are measured for inclusion in the annual report of
34 accountability.
35 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
36 that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
37 based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
38 the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
39 statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 6.2-6.4 and 8.5 of
40 this bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts and charter
41 schools in this State. Section 6.5 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for
42 the Superintendent to designate a school district or sponsor of a charter school as
43 low-performing or underperforming. Section 9.3 of this bill requires: (1) the
44 Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter school designated
45 as underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings; and
46 (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit to the Department a school district or
47 sponsor of a charter school performance improvement plan and a school board or
48 sponsor of a charter school improvement plan. Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes the
49 Superintendent to take certain actions if the board of trustees of a school district or
50 sponsor of a charter school does not make adequate progress toward meeting the
51 goals and benchmarks necessary to improve the performance of the school district
52 or charter school. Section 9.7 of this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a
53 school district or sponsor of a charter school designated as underperforming on
54 probation if the designation was based on certain findings relating to the
55 performance of pupils; and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit certain
56 plans to the Superintendent. Section 9.7 also establishes the actions that the
57 Superintendent is authorized to take if the school district or sponsor of a charter
58 school does not make adequate progress toward improving the performance of
59 pupils.
60 Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as
61 low-performing, and sections 14.25-14.4 of this bill prescribe the actions that may
62 be taken with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or
63 persistently underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a
64 process for state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school
65 that is designated as persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes
66 provisions governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key
67 members of the staff of a school. Section 14.4 establishes provisions governing the
68 corrective measure of the direct management of a school by the Department.
69 Section 56.5 of this bill: (1) creates the Education Service Center; (2) provides for
70 the appointment of a governing body for the Center; and (3) requires the Center to
71 provide certain assistance and guidance to public schools and school districts that
72 are experiencing low performance.
73 Section 9.3 requires the Superintendent to place certain underperforming
74 school districts or sponsors of charter schools on probation.
75 Section 84.5 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to, in preparing the
76 Nevada Revised Statutes, substitute the term: (1) “focus” for the term “low-
77 performing” as previously used in reference to a low-performing school district,
78 sponsor of a charter school or school; and (2) “priority” for the term
79 “underperforming” as previously used in reference to an underperforming school
80 district or sponsor of a charter school or persistently underperforming school.
81 (NRS 220.120)
82 Existing law provides that, on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
83 trustees of each school district and the State Public Charter School Authority is
84 required to prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of
85 accountability concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district
-
*SB460_R2*

– 4 –
86 or charter school. (NRS 385A.070) Sections 7.4 and 7.5 of this bill revise certain
87 provisions governing the report.
88 Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such
89 school districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9.1
90 of this bill provides for the impaneling of a Public Education Oversight Board
91 under certain circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the
92 authority granted to the board of trustees of a school district to take actions
93 necessary to remedy the cause of recommendations submitted by the
94 Superintendent of Public Instruction. Section 9.1 additionally sets forth: (1) the
95 membership of the Board; and (2) requirements for meetings of the Board.
96 Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each
97 county school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only
98 the Clark County School District); (2) provides that four members of such a board
99 of trustees are appointed, nonvoting members; and (3) sets forth requirements for
100 electing officers of any board of trustees of a school district. (NRS 386.120,
101 386.165, 386.310) Section 10 of this bill: (1) provides that such appointed,
102 nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the prohibition
103 on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
104 bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to
105 serve as officers.
106 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
107 duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill
108 requires the Commission to: (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the
109 method of calculating the percentage of at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a
110 third party to verify such methods and to submit a report containing the findings
111 and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62 of this bill
112 authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
113 measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions
114 governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
115 pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an
116 interim study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
117 Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and
118 authorizes the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter
119 schools and nonprofit organizations to support early childhood literacy and
120 readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-387.1277) Existing law additionally requires
121 the Department, to the extent money is available, to award grants to school districts,
122 sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit organizations to support prekindergarten
123 programs. (NRS 387.652) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends eligibility to receive
124 grants to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs to institutions
125 within the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (2) expands the categories of
126 children served by such a program. Section 13.5 of this bill creates similar
127 provisions for grants to support prekindergarten programs.
128 Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain
129 classes not exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a
130 variance to a school district that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school
131 year. (NRS 388.700). Section 16 of this bill requires requests for, and reports
132 concerning, variances of requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher to
133 be submitted annually rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make
134 conforming changes to reflect the change to the timelines for such submissions.
135 (NRS 388.723, 388.725)
136 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
137 intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
138 pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
139 referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
140 Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Section 8.3 of this bill requires the statewide
-
*SB460_R2*

– 5 –
141 system of accountability for public schools to include, for elementary schools,
142 targets for the proportion of pupils demonstrating adequate proficiency in the
143 subject area of reading and adequate progress to achieving such proficiency.
144 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
145 body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
146 in an elementary school that includes procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil
147 in reading by using assessments that have been approved by the State Board. (NRS
148 388.157) Section 15.6 of this bill removes the requirement that such assessments be
149 approved by the State Board thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school
150 district or the governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the
151 plan any valid and reliable standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in
152 reading. This bill also authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt
153 regulations prescribing how the results of any assessment used by a school district
154 or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2)
155 prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school district or charter school
156 if no assessment is included in the plan.
157 Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of
158 days in a school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school
159 year to contain at least 4 days of professional development for elementary school
160 staff and prescribes the focus of such professional development.
161 Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to
162 employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive
163 program for school counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each
164 public school located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
165 Clark and Washoe Counties) to provide for the availability of a school counselor or
166 an equivalent service.
167 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes
168 the membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law
169 additionally sets forth the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter
170 school and amending a charter contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276,
171 388A.279) Existing law further requires the sponsor of a charter school to submit a
172 report containing certain information to the Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section
173 20 of this bill changes the membership of the Authority. Section 19 of this bill
174 authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to object to the placement
175 of a proposed charter school. Sections 21 and 23 of this bill revise certain
176 requirements relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter school;
177 (2) the review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration
178 of such an application. Section 25 of this bill requires the Authority to take certain
179 actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it
180 sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a
181 charter school to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all
182 revenues for the charter school.
183 Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the
184 charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the
185 charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter
186 school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) Section 25.3 of
187 this bill: (1) instead provides that the sponsor of a charter school is required to
188 terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter
189 contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance
190 of the charter school in 3 consecutive years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on
191 using the rating of a charter school issued for any school year before the 2015-2016
192 school year for making such a determination. Sections 25.3 and 25.5 of this bill
193 also provide that, until October 1, 2027, the sponsor of such a charter school is not
194 required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
195 charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public
-
*SB460_R2*

– 6 –
196 schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from the
197 immediately preceding school year by a certain percentage.
198 Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction
199 at a charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS
200 388A.518) Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any
201 teacher who provides instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or
202 endorsement. Section 27 of this bill provides that the governing body of a charter
203 school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of pupils if the rules are not more
204 restrictive than those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional public schools,
205 thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing body of a
206 charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS
207 392.130-392.220)
208 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this
209 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
210 the Clark County School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS
211 388G.530, 388G.600) Under existing law, a local school precinct is required to
212 operate using site-based decision-making in which certain responsibilities are
213 transferred from the large school district to the local school precinct. (NRS
214 388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 33.2-33.54 and
215 33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect this change. Sections 33.57-
216 33.59 of this bill revise provisions governing certain duties of the superintendent of
217 schools of a large school district.
218 Existing law: (1) authorizes a local school precinct to carry forward its year-end
219 balance to the next school year for use by the local school precinct; and (2) requires
220 a local school precinct that carries forward a balance that exceeds 5 percent of its
221 actual expenditures to use the money for certain purposes. (NRS 388G.650)
222 Section 33.56 of this bill authorizes a large school district to intervene to require a
223 local school precinct to spend any money carried forward for certain purposes.
224 Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an
225 organizational team for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the
226 position of principal for a local school precinct (NRS 388G.740) Section 33.8 of
227 this bill revises these provisions.
228 Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
229 (2) establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on
230 behalf of a pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a
231 scholarship organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing
232 certain information. (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes
233 certain reporting requirements for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of
234 this bill requires such schools to administer certain examinations and assessments
235 to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each school that receives such a
236 grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section 32 of this bill
237 applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections 30-
238 31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)
239 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
240 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections
241 31.2-31.7 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
242 Statutes. Section 31.2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
243 Department by submitting certain information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a
244 registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department certain
245 information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and (2) the
246 Department to compile certain information submitted by each scholarship
247 organization and review the information to determine whether to recommend a
248 change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5 requires
249 a registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
250 donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
-
*SB460_R2*

– 7 –
251 donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6 requires the Department of Education
252 to: (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
253 Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
254 Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a summary
255 of certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
256 Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
257 scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
258 a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a
259 scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
260 pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.
261 Section 31.8 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to the provisions that may be cited
262 as the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
263 Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain
264 limitations on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or
265 assessment; and (2) the number of examinations or assessments administered in a
266 school year. (NRS 390.805) Section 35 of this bill establishes additional
267 requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain reporting
268 requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare for and conduct
269 examinations and assessments.
270 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and
271 Retention within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the
272 Commission; and (3) require the Commission to study issues relating to the
273 recruitment and retention of educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals
274 provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher and Education Support Professional
275 Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby dissolving the Task
276 Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
277 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
278 and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the
279 State Board, for licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011,
280 391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this bill requires the Commission to establish
281 requirements for a person to obtain a provisional license with an endorsement as a
282 registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization for the State Board to
283 disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections 39-42 of this bill
284 make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority granted to the State
285 Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of certain
286 reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill
287 requires the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each
288 provider approved by the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training.
289 (NRS 391.039) Section 48 of this bill eliminates the requirement that certain
290 reports concerning a shortage of teachers be submitted to the State Board.
291 (NRS 391.125)
292 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
293 or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
294 sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
295 additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
296 the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
297 county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
298 city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
299 (NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
300 authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
301 enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
302 by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
303 charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if certain conditions are met.
304 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
305 language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
-
*SB460_R2*

– 8 –
306 and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
307 adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
308 courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of
309 this bill makes certain requirements governing the standards and instruction for
310 English language arts. Section 33.93 of this bill requires the Department, to the
311 extent that money is available for such a purpose, to establish a pilot program under
312 which schools or groups of schools may apply to the Department for grants to
313 integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics into instruction in
314 literacy. Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State Board to use the results of the
315 pilot program to determine whether model curriculum for English language arts
316 should include phonics-based instruction and the integration of science, technology,
317 engineering and mathematics into English language arts in kindergarten and grades
318 1, 2 and 3.
319 Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
320 and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
321 altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
322 pupils or other school employees if: (1) the school employee is acting within the
323 course and scope of his or her employment and within the course and scope of his
324 or her role in maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of
325 the school employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the
326 policies of the school district or school at which the school employee is employed;
327 and (3) any harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful,
328 grossly negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to
329 the rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this
330 immunity from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
331 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
332 to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
333 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a
334 license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in
335 elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require
336 the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
337 kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
338 obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
339 instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
340 meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
341 the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the Nevada System
342 of Higher Education to collaborate with the Department and the Commission to
343 establish such courses.
344 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
345 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
346 serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
347 period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
348 right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
349 during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
350 receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section
351 52.5 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an
352 additional probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary
353 employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that
354 additional probationary period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may
355 notify the employee that the employee may not be reemployed for the next contract
356 year; or (2) the superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of
357 dismissing the employee during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a school
358 district does not reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is
359 required to provide: (1) the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and
360 hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school

361 leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in
362 managing transitions and improving teaching practices.
363 Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
364 period of probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a
365 postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a performance
366 improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to
367 section 38.7 of this bill. Under section 38.8, at the conclusion of the period of
368 probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must be evaluated.
369 If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate progress toward
370 meeting improvement goals, section 38.8 authorizes the teacher to not be
371 reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary employee.
372 Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
373 sections 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track
374 certain data relating to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for
375 school administrators, assess the effectiveness of such programs and make
376 recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
377 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
378 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
379 school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
380 training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 56.2 of this bill requires the board of trustees of
381 each school district and the governing body of each charter school to ensure that
382 teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of
383 schools in which such pupils are enrolled, certain other administrators and
384 paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils complete a course of professional
385 development training in the science of reading that is approved by the Department.
386 Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a
387 teacher or other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of
388 Public Instruction a complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission
389 authorizing the Superintendent to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository
390 for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal history of the
391 applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
392 “FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 179A.075,
393 391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an applicant
394 for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
395 the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a
396 report on the criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill
397 authorizes the Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in
398 the in the Rap Back Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
399 (FBI) for the purpose of enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status
400 notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed by the Superintendent.
401 Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for the issuance of
402 a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
403 systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the
404 Rap Back Program; and (2) the Central Repository must establish certain methods
405 of handling such fingerprints. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of
406 such criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in
407 the system when a person is no longer licensed. Section 60 additionally requires the
408 Department to obtain consent from a person before submitting his or her
409 fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under section 83, persons who
410 are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes
411 effective are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the
412 time of the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would
413 not submit fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a
414 conforming change related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that
415 fingerprints for a background check would no longer be submitted with a renewal
-

416 application when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS 391.040)
417 Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a
418 person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment
419 after certain leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check
420 because the Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through
421 the Rap Back Program. (NRS 391.104)
422 The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a
423 superintendent of schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board
424 of trustees of a school district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
425 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to comply with certain requirements
426 when hiring a superintendent of schools.
427 Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance
428 evaluation system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation
429 of probationary teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how
430 pupil growth is calculated for the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this
431 bill revises the observation cycles for probationary teachers.
432 Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational
433 growth, rather than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480)
434 Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the change made in
435 section 50.
436 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
437 program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
438 retention of licensed teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of
439 this bill requires each large school district to establish through negotiations with an
440 employee organization a differential pay scale for certain licensed educational
441 personnel assigned to certain Title I schools. Section 56 of this bill requires the
442 board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each fiscal year an
443 amount of money sufficient to provide such a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill
444 defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of
445 this bill requires the differential pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory
446 collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill clarifies the manner in which the
447 provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
448 Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional
449 development of teachers and administrators to provide certain training for
450 educational personnel. (NRS 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain
451 requirements for such training.
452 Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to
453 provide for the establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of
454 Regents whose duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59
455 of this bill requires the Board of Regents, in consultation with the Department, to
456 develop a method for sharing with the Department certain numbers used for the
457 identification of students.
458 Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System
459 of Higher Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for
460 assessing the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative
461 assessment methods; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
462 Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a
463 summary of a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS
464 354.6015) Section 67 of this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of
465 trustees of school districts.
466 Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by
467 the Labor Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with
468 the advice and guidance of the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110,
469 610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill create the Nevada Registered
470 Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada Registered Teacher
-
*SB460_R2*

– 11 –
471 Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the State
472 Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
473 Sections 71-78.8 of this bill make certain appropriations for various purposes
474 related to education.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 385 of NRS is hereby amended by adding

7 which the public elementary school is located or, if the public
8 elementary school is a charter school, the sponsor of the charter
9 school. The plan must comply with the requirements of the Every
10 Student Succeeds Act of 2015, 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq., and

10 improvement.
11 (b) Assess the performance of the principal of the public
12 school and his or her responsibility for the failure of the school to
13 meet the goals set forth pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1.
14 The superintendent of schools of the school district or the
15 executive director of the charter school may, to assess the
16 performance of the principal pursuant to this paragraph, consider
17 the rate of chronic absenteeism, as defined by the Department
18 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 392.150, at the public school. If
19 the superintendent or executive director of the charter school
20 determines that the principal is ineffective and responsible for the
21 failure, the board of trustees must, except as otherwise provided in

25 district or charter school, as applicable.
26 (c) If the principal of the school is not removed from his or her
27 position pursuant to paragraph (b), the principal must reapply to
28 the board of trustees of the school district for his or her current
29 position.
30 4. A principal who is the subject of a performance assessment

20 Sec. 1.7. 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
21 (a) Enhance the efficiency of education reporting
22 requirements by eliminating the reporting of redundant
23 information and data, reducing administrative burdens and
24 ensuring that all reports serve a meaningful purpose in supporting
25 educational outcomes.
26 (b) Ensure that teachers and school administrators, who are
27 directly impacted by reporting requirements, have agency in
28 recommending modifications to reporting requirements.
29 (c) Preserve transparency, the accountability of public schools
30 and school districts for the quality of schools and the educational
31 achievement of pupils, and the accessibility of information and
32 data concerning the educational achievement of pupils.
33 2. A teacher or school administrator employed at a public
34 school, a charter management organization that operates a
35 charter school or an educational management organization that
36 provides support or operations to a charter school may submit a
37 petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public
38 school or school district to report information or data to another
39 person or entity. Such a petition must be submitted to the
40 superintendent of schools of the school district in which the public
41 school is located or, if the public school is a charter school, the
42 governing body of the charter school. The petition must:
43 (a) Clearly identify the requirement to report information or

11 body of the charter school, as applicable, shall:
12 (a) Review the petition to determine whether the requirement
13 to report data or information that is proposed for modification,

17 outcomes.
18 (b) If the petition requests to modify, suspend or eliminate a
19 requirement for a public school to report data or information to

23 or redundant or does not provide data that is used by the school
24 district to support educational outcomes, approve the petition and
25 issue a decision modifying, eliminating or suspending the
26 requirement. If the superintendent of schools of the school district
27 issues such a decision, the superintendent shall provide notice of
28 the approval of the petition to the petitioner, each public school
29 within the school district and any other person or entity affected
30 by the modification, suspension or elimination of the reporting
31 requirement. If the superintendent of public schools of the school
32 district denies a petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a
33 requirement for a public school to report data or information to
34 the school district, the superintendent shall provide a written
35 explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner. A
36 petitioner whose petition is denied pursuant to this paragraph may

7 paragraph may submit a request for reconsideration of the denial
8 to the superintendent of schools or governing body of the charter
9 school, as applicable, or resubmit the petition with additional
10 information.
11 4. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall evaluate
12 each petition forwarded to the Department pursuant to subsection
13 3 and, as part of such an evaluation, consider:
14 (a) Any information provided by the petitioner, including,
15 without limitation, any statements of support from school
16 leadership, governing bodies, teachers or other educational
17 personnel;
18 (b) The necessity of the reporting requirement for compliance
19 with federal or state law;
20 (c) Whether the information or data that is reported is

25 learning; and
26 (e) The potential impact of the modification, suspension or
27 elimination of the reporting requirement on transparency, the
28 accountability of public schools and school districts for the quality
29 of schools and the educational achievement of pupils, and the
30 accessibility of information and data concerning the educational
31 achievement of pupils.
32 5. Not later than 180 days after receiving a petition for
33 evaluation pursuant to subsection 4, the Superintendent of Public
34 Instruction shall approve the petition, deny the petition or request
35 additional information or revisions to the petition. If the
36 Superintendent requests additional information or revisions to the

38 receiving such additional information or revisions, approve or
39 deny the petition.
40 6. If, after conducting an evaluation of a petition pursuant to
41 subsection 4, the Superintendent of Public Instruction finds that
42 the requirement to report data or information proposed for
43 modification, suspension or elimination is duplicative or

5 explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner and the
6 superintendent of schools of the school district or governing body
7 of the charter school, as applicable, that forwarded the petition to
8 the Department pursuant to subsection 3. If the Superintendent of
9 Public Instruction issues an order modifying, suspending or
