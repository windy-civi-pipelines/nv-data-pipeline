Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Department of Education, which consists of the
2 State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS
3 385.010) Existing law: (1) requires the State Board to prepare a plan to improve the
4 academic achievement of pupils; and (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan.
5 (NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also requires the board of trustees of each
6 school district and the governing bodies of certain charter schools to prepare an
7 annual report of accountability that contains certain information, including, without
8 limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational personnel and
9 paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)
10 Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) requires each public elementary school to prepare a
11 plan to improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary
12 schools; (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan, including, without
13 limitation, certain goals for public elementary schools; and (3) establishes
14 requirements governing the consequences for the principal of a public elementary
15 school that does not meet such goals. Sections 4, 5 and 58 of this bill make
16 changes regarding the entity required to prepare such a plan pursuant to existing
17 law. (NRS 385.111)
18 Section 1.7 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
19 schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
20 to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
21 to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
22 information or data that is used by the Department, the State Board or any other
23 person or entity to support educational outcomes.
24 Section 6.1 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
25 information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to
26 existing law and section 1.3. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain
27 requirements governing the annual report of accountability to the reporting
28 requirements set forth in section 6.1. Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by
29 which teacher vacancies are measured for inclusion in the annual report of
30 accountability.
31 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
32 that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
-
*SB460_R1*

– 3 –
33 based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
34 the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
35 statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 8.5
36 of this bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts and
37 charter schools in this State. Section 6.5 of this bill establishes criteria and
38 procedures for the Superintendent to designate a school district or sponsor of a
39 charter school as low-performing or underperforming. Section 9.3 of this bill
40 requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter
41 school designated as underperforming on probation if the designation is based on
42 certain findings; and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit to the
43 Department a school district or sponsor of a charter school performance
44 improvement plan and a school board or sponsor of a charter school improvement
45 plan. Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes the Superintendent to take certain actions if
46 the board of trustees of a school district or sponsor of a charter school does not
47 make adequate progress toward meeting the goals and benchmarks necessary to
48 improve the performance of the school district or charter school. Section 9.7 of this
49 bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter
50 school designated as underperforming on probation if the designation was based on
51 certain findings relating to the performance of pupils; and (2) such a school district
52 or sponsor to submit certain plans to the Superintendent. Section 9.7 also
53 establishes the actions that the Superintendent is authorized to take if the school
54 district or sponsor of a charter school does not make adequate progress toward
55 improving the performance of pupils.
56 Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as
57 low-performing, and sections 14.25-14.65 of this bill prescribe the actions that may
58 be taken with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or
59 persistently underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a
60 process for state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school
61 that is designated as persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes
62 provisions governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key
63 members of the staff of a school. Section 14.4 establishes provisions governing the
64 corrective measure of the direct management of a school by the Department.
65 Section 56.5 of this bill: (1) creates the Education Service Center; (2) provides for
66 the appointment of a governing body for the Center; and (3) requires the Center to
67 provide certain assistance and guidance to public schools and school districts that
68 are experiencing low performance.
69 Section 9.3 requires the Superintendent to place certain underperforming
70 school districts or sponsors of charter schools on probation.
71 Existing law provides that, on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
72 trustees of each school district and the State Public Charter School Authority is
73 required to prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of
74 accountability concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district
75 or charter school. (NRS 385A.070) Sections 7.4 and 7.5 of this bill revise certain
76 provisions governing the report.
77 Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such
78 school districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9.1
79 of this bill provides for the impaneling of a Public Education Oversight Board
80 under certain circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the
81 authority granted to the board of trustees of a school district to take actions
82 necessary to remedy the cause of recommendations submitted by the
83 Superintendent of Public Instruction. Section 9.1 additionally sets forth: (1) the
84 membership of the Board; and (2) requirements for meetings of the Board.
85 Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each
86 county school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only
87 the Clark County School District); (2) provides that four members of such a board
-
*SB460_R1*

– 4 –
88 of trustees are appointed, nonvoting members; and (3) sets forth requirements for
89 electing officers of any board of trustees of a school district. (NRS 386.120,
90 386.165, 386.310) Section 10 of this bill: (1) provides that such appointed,
91 nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the prohibition
92 on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
93 bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to
94 serve as officers.
95 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
96 duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill
97 requires the Commission to: (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the
98 method of calculating the percentage of at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a
99 third party to verify such methods and to submit a report containing the findings
100 and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62 of this bill
101 authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
102 measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions
103 governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
104 pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an
105 interim study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
106 Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and
107 authorizes the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter
108 schools and nonprofit organizations to support early childhood literacy and
109 readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-387.1277) Existing law additionally requires
110 the Department, to the extent money is available, to award grants to school districts,
111 sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit organizations to support prekindergarten
112 programs. (NRS 387.652) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends eligibility to receive
113 grants to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs to institutions
114 within the Nevada System of Higher Education and private, for-profit
115 organizations; and (2) expands the categories of children served by such a program.
116 Section 13.5 of this bill creates similar provisions for grants to support
117 prekindergarten programs.
118 Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain
119 classes not exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a
120 variance to a school district that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school
121 year. (NRS 388.700) Section 14 of this bill sets forth requirements for the ratio of
122 teachers per administrator in each elementary school within a school district in a
123 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County).
124 Section 16 of this bill requires requests for, and reports concerning, variances of
125 requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher to be submitted annually
126 rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make conforming changes to
127 reflect the change to the timelines for such submissions. (NRS 388.723, 388.725)
128 Existing law provides certain exceptions to the requirement that a pupil attend a
129 public school in his or her zone of attendance. (NRS 388.040) Section 14.7 of this
130 bill provides for additional exceptions to this requirement. Section 14.65 requires
131 the Department to create a grant program to assist certain eligible pupils in
132 obtaining transportation to a school he or she attends outside of his or her zone of
133 attendance.
134 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
135 intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
136 pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
137 referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
138 Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Section 14.2 of this bill requires: (1) a service
139 provider to register with the school district to be eligible to provide literacy
140 intervention, tutoring and related services to pupils; and (2) such services to be
141 scientifically based and to meet certain criteria. Section 8.3 of this bill requires the
142 statewide system of accountability for public schools to include, for elementary
-
*SB460_R1*

– 5 –
143 schools, targets for the proportion of pupils demonstrating adequate proficiency in
144 the subject area of reading and adequate progress to achieving such proficiency.
145 Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of
146 days in a school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school
147 year to contain at least 4 days of professional development for elementary school
148 staff and prescribes the focus of such professional development.
149 Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to
150 employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive
151 program for school counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each
152 public school located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
153 Clark and Washoe Counties) to provide for the availability of a school counselor or
154 an equivalent service.
155 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes
156 the membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law
157 additionally sets forth the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter
158 school and amending a charter contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276,
159 388A.279) Existing law further requires the sponsor of a charter school to submit a
160 report containing certain information to the Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section
161 20 of this bill changes the membership of the Authority. Section 19 of this bill
162 authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to object to the placement
163 of a proposed charter school. Sections 21-23 of this bill revise certain requirements
164 relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter school; (2) the
165 review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration of
166 such an application. Section 25 of this bill requires the Authority to take certain
167 actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it
168 sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a
169 charter school to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all
170 revenues for the charter school.
171 Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction
172 at a charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS
173 388A.518) Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any
174 teacher who provides instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or
175 endorsement. Section 27 of this bill provides that the governing body of a charter
176 school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of pupils if the rules are not more
177 restrictive than those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional public schools,
178 thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing body of a
179 charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS
180 392.130-392.220)
181 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this
182 State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
183 the Clark County School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS
184 388G.530, 388G.600) Under existing law, a local school precinct is required to
185 operate using site-based decision-making in which certain responsibilities are
186 transferred from the large school district to the local school precinct. (NRS
187 388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 33.2-33.7 and
188 33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect this change.
189 Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an
190 organizational team for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the
191 position of principal for a local school precinct (NRS 388G.740) Section 33.8 of
192 this bill revises these provisions.
193 Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
194 (2) establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on
195 behalf of a pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a
196 scholarship organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing
197 certain information. (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes
-
*SB460_R1*

– 6 –
198 certain reporting requirements for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of
199 this bill requires such schools to administer certain examinations and assessments
200 to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each school that receives such a
201 grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section 32 of this bill
202 applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections 30-
203 31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)
204 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
205 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections
206 31.2-31.7 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
207 Statutes. Section 31.2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
208 Department by submitting certain information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a
209 registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department certain
210 information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and (2) the
211 Department to compile certain information submitted by each scholarship
212 organization and review the information to determine whether to recommend a
213 change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5 requires
214 a registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
215 donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
216 donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6 requires the Department of Education
217 to: (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
218 Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
219 Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a summary
220 of certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
221 Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
222 scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
223 a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a
224 scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
225 pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.
226 Section 31.8 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to the provisions that may be cited
227 as the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
228 Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain
229 limitations on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or
230 assessment; and (2) the number of examinations or assessments administered in a
231 school year. (NRS 390.805) Section 35 of this bill establishes additional
232 requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain reporting
233 requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare for and conduct
234 examinations and assessments.
235 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and
236 Retention within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the
237 Commission; and (3) require the Commission to study issues relating to the
238 recruitment and retention of educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals
239 provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher and Education Support Professional
240 Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby dissolving the Task
241 Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
242 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
243 and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the
244 State Board, for licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011,
245 391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this bill requires the Commission to establish
246 requirements for a person to obtain a provisional license with an endorsement as a
247 registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization for the State Board to
248 disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections 39, 40, 41 and 42
249 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority granted to the
250 State Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of
251 certain reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill
252 requires the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each
-
*SB460_R1*

– 7 –
253 provider approved by the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training.
254 (NRS 391.039) Section 48 of this bill eliminates the requirement that certain
255 reports concerning a shortage of teachers be submitted to the State Board.
256 (NRS 391.125)
257 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
258 or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
259 sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
260 additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
261 the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
262 county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
263 city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
264 (NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
265 authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
266 enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
267 by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
268 charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if certain conditions are met.
269 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
270 language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
271 and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
272 adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
273 courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of
274 this bill makes certain requirements governing the standards and instruction for
275 English language arts. Section 33.93 of this bill requires the Department, to the
276 extent that money is available for such a purpose, to establish a pilot program under
277 which schools or groups of schools may apply to the Department for grants to
278 integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics into instruction in
279 literacy. Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State Board to use the results of the
280 pilot program to determine whether model curriculum for English language arts
281 should include phonics-based instruction and the integration of science, technology,
282 engineering and mathematics into English language arts in kindergarten and grades
283 1, 2 and 3.
284 Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
285 and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
286 altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
287 pupils or other school employees if: (1) the school employee is acting within the
288 course and scope of his or her employment and within the course and scope of his
289 or her role in maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of
290 the school employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the
291 policies of the school district or school at which the school employee is employed;
292 and (3) any harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful,
293 grossly negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to
294 the rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this
295 immunity from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
296 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
297 to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
298 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a
299 license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in
300 elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require
301 the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
302 kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
303 obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
304 instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
305 meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
306 the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the Nevada System
-
*SB460_R1*

– 8 –
307 of Higher Education to collaborate with the Department and the Commission to
308 establish such courses.
309 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
310 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
311 serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
312 period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
313 right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
314 during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
315 receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section
316 52.5 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an
317 additional probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary
318 employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that
319 additional probationary period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may
320 notify the employee that the employee will not be reemployed for the next contract
321 year; or (2) the superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of
322 dismissing the employee during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a school
323 district does not reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is
324 required to provide: (1) the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and
325 hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school
326 leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in
327 managing transitions and improving teaching practices.
328 Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
329 period of probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a
330 postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a performance
331 improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to
332 section 38.7 of this bill. Under section 38.8, at the conclusion of the period of
333 probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must be evaluated.
334 If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate progress toward
335 meeting improvement goals, section 38.8 authorizes the teacher to not be
336 reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary employee.
337 Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
338 sections 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track
339 certain data relating to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for
340 school administrators, assess the effectiveness of such programs and make
341 recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
342 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
343 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
344 school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
345 training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 56.2 of this bill requires the board of trustees of
346 each school district and the governing body of each charter school to ensure that
347 teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of
348 schools in which such pupils are enrolled, certain other administrators and
349 paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils complete a course of professional
350 development training in the science of reading that is approved by the Department.
351 Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a
352 teacher or other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of
353 Public Instruction a complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission
354 authorizing the Superintendent to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository
355 for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal history of the
356 applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
357 “FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 179A.075,
358 391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an applicant
359 for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
360 the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a
361 report on the criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill
-
*SB460_R1*

– 9 –
362 authorizes the Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in
363 the in the Rap Back Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
364 (FBI) for the purpose of enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status
365 notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed by the Superintendent.
366 Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for the issuance of
367 a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
368 systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the
369 Rap Back Program; and (2) the Central Repository must establish certain methods
370 of handling such fingerprints. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of
371 such criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in
372 the system when a person is no longer licensed. Section 60 additionally requires the
373 Department to obtain consent from a person before submitting his or her
374 fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under section 83, persons who
375 are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes
376 effective are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the
377 time of the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would
378 not submit fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a
379 conforming change related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that
380 fingerprints for a background check would no longer be submitted with a renewal
381 application when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS 391.040)
382 Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a
383 person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment
384 after certain leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check
385 because the Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through
386 the Rap Back Program. (NRS 391.104)
387 The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a
388 superintendent of schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board
389 of trustees of a school district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
390 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to comply with certain requirements
391 when hiring a superintendent of schools.
392 Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance
393 evaluation system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation
394 of probationary teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how
395 pupil growth is calculated for the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this
396 bill revises the observation cycles for probationary teachers.
397 Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational
398 growth, rather than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480)
399 Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the change made in
400 section 50.
401 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
402 program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
403 retention of licensed teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of
404 this bill requires each large school district to establish through negotiations with an
405 employee organization a differential pay scale for certain licensed educational
406 personnel assigned to certain Title I schools. Section 56 of this bill requires the
407 board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each fiscal year an
408 amount of money sufficient to provide such a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill
409 defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of
410 this bill requires the differential pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory
411 collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill clarifies the manner in which the
412 provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
413 Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional
414 development of teachers and administrators to provide certain training for
415 educational personnel. (NRS 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain
416 requirements for such training.

417 Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to
418 provide for the establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of
419 Regents whose duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59
420 of this bill requires the Board of Regents, in consultation with the Department, to
421 develop a method for sharing with the Department certain numbers used for the
422 identification of students.
423 Section 80 of this bill directs the Commission on School Funding to perform
424 certain tasks concerning the examination of resource levels and funding levels that
425 represent the best practices for adequately meeting the needs of pupils.
426 Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System
427 of Higher Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for
428 assessing the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative
429 assessment methods; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
430 Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a
431 summary of a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS
432 354.6015) Section 67 of this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of
433 trustees of school districts.
434 Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by
435 the Labor Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with
436 the advice and guidance of the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110,
437 610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill create the Nevada Registered
438 Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada Registered Teacher
439 Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the State
440 Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
441 Sections 71-78.8 of this bill make certain appropriations for various purposes
442 related to education.
