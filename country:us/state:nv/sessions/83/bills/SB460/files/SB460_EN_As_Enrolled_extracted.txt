State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS

Section 2:
385.010) Existing law: (1) requires the State Board to prepare a plan to improve the
academic achievement of pupils; and (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan.
(NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also requires the board of trustees of each
school district and the governing bodies of certain charter schools to prepare an
annual report of accountability that contains certain information, including, without
limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational personnel and
paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)

Section 3:
Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) requires each public elementary school to prepare a
plan to improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary
schools; (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan, including, without
limitation, certain goals for public elementary schools; and (3) establishes
requirements governing the consequences for the principal of a public elementary
school that does not meet such goals. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill make changes
regarding the entity required to prepare such a plan pursuant to existing law.
(NRS 385.111)

Section 4:
Section 1.7 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
information or data that is used by the Department, the State Board or any other
person or entity to support educational outcomes.
Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
Education for the purpose of developing a statewide vision and implementation
plan to improve public education in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 5.5 of this
bill revises the duties of the Commission.

Section 5:
Section 6.1 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to
existing law and section 1.3. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain
requirements governing the annual report of accountability to the reporting
requirements set forth in section 6.1. Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by
which teacher vacancies are measured for inclusion in the annual report of
accountability.
Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 6.2-6.4 and 8.5 of
this bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts and charter
schools in this State. Section 6.5 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for
the Superintendent to designate a school district or sponsor of a charter school as
low-performing or underperforming. Section 9.3 of this bill requires: (1) the
Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter school designated
as underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings; and
(2) such a school district or sponsor to submit to the Department a school district or
sponsor of a charter school performance improvement plan and a school board or
sponsor of a charter school improvement plan. Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes the
Superintendent to take certain actions if the board of trustees of a school district or
sponsor of a charter school does not make adequate progress toward meeting the
goals and benchmarks necessary to improve the performance of the school district
or charter school. Section 9.7 of this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a
-

school district or sponsor of a charter school designated as underperforming on
probation if the designation was based on certain findings relating to the
performance of pupils; and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit certain
plans to the Superintendent. Section 9.7 also establishes the actions that the

school does not make adequate progress toward improving the performance of
pupils.

Section 6:
Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as
low-performing, and sections 14.25-14.4 of this bill prescribe the actions that may
be taken with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or
persistently underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a
process for state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school
that is designated as persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes
provisions governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key
members of the staff of a school. Section 14.4 establishes provisions governing the
corrective measure of the direct management of a school by the Department.

Section 7:
Section 56.5 of this bill: (1) creates the Education Service Center; (2) provides for
the appointment of a governing body for the Center; and (3) requires the Center to

school districts or sponsors of charter schools on probation.

Section 9:
Section 84.5 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to, in preparing the
Nevada Revised Statutes, substitute the term: (1) “focus” for the term “low-
performing” as previously used in reference to a low-performing school district,
sponsor of a charter school or school; and (2) “priority” for the term
“underperforming” as previously used in reference to an underperforming school
district or sponsor of a charter school or persistently underperforming school.
(NRS 220.120)
Existing law provides that, on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
trustees of each school district and the State Public Charter School Authority is
required to prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of
accountability concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district
or charter school. (NRS 385A.070) Sections 7.4 and 7.5 of this bill revise certain
provisions governing the report.
Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such
school districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9.1
of this bill provides for the impaneling of a Public Education Oversight Board
under certain circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the
authority granted to the board of trustees of a school district to take actions
necessary to remedy the cause of recommendations submitted by the
Superintendent of Public Instruction. Section 9.1 additionally sets forth: (1) the
membership of the Board; and (2) requirements for meetings of the Board.
Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each
county school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only

Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill
requires the Commission to: (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the
method of calculating the percentage of at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a
third party to verify such methods and to submit a report containing the findings
and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62 of this bill
authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions
governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an
interim study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and
authorizes the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter
schools and nonprofit organizations to support early childhood literacy and
readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-387.1277) Existing law additionally requires
the Department, to the extent money is available, to award grants to school districts,
sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit organizations to support prekindergarten
programs. (NRS 387.652) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends eligibility to receive
grants to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs to institutions
within the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (2) expands the categories of
children served by such a program. Section 13.5 of this bill creates similar
provisions for grants to support prekindergarten programs.
Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain
classes not exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a
variance to a school district that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school
year. (NRS 388.700). Section 16 of this bill requires requests for, and reports
concerning, variances of requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher to
be submitted annually rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make
conforming changes to reflect the change to the timelines for such submissions.
(NRS 388.723, 388.725)
Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Section 8.3 of this bill requires the statewide
system of accountability for public schools to include, for elementary schools,
targets for the proportion of pupils demonstrating adequate proficiency in the
subject area of reading and adequate progress to achieving such proficiency.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
in an elementary school that includes procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil
in reading by using assessments that have been approved by the State Board. (NRS

Section 11:
388.157) Section 15.6 of this bill removes the requirement that such assessments be
approved by the State Board thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school
district or the governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the
plan any valid and reliable standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in
reading. This bill also authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt
regulations prescribing how the results of any assessment used by a school district
or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2)
prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school district or charter school
if no assessment is included in the plan.
Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of
days in a school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 5 –
year to contain at least 4 days of professional development for elementary school
staff and prescribes the focus of such professional development.
Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to
employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive
program for school counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each
public school located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
Clark and Washoe Counties) to provide for the availability of a school counselor or
an equivalent service.
Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes
the membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law
additionally sets forth the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter
school and amending a charter contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276,
388A.279) Existing law further requires the sponsor of a charter school to submit a
report containing certain information to the Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section
20 of this bill changes the membership of the Authority. Section 19 of this bill
authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to object to the placement
of a proposed charter school. Sections 21 and 23 of this bill revise certain
requirements relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter school;
(2) the review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration
of such an application. Section 25 of this bill requires the Authority to take certain
actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it
sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a
charter school to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all
revenues for the charter school.
Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the
charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the
charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter
school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) Section 25.3 of
this bill: (1) instead provides that the sponsor of a charter school is required to
terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter
contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance
of the charter school in 3 consecutive years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on
using the rating of a charter school issued for any school year before the 2015-2016
school year for making such a determination. Sections 25.3 and 25.5 of this bill
also provide that, until October 1, 2027, the sponsor of such a charter school is not
required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public
schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from the
immediately preceding school year by a certain percentage.
Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction
at a charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS
388A.518) Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any
teacher who provides instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or
endorsement. Section 27 of this bill provides that the governing body of a charter
school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of pupils if the rules are not more
restrictive than those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional public schools,
thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing body of a
charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS

Section 12:
392.130-392.220)
Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this
State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
the Clark County School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS
388G.530, 388G.600) Under existing law, a local school precinct is required to
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 6 –
operate using site-based decision-making in which certain responsibilities are
transferred from the large school district to the local school precinct. (NRS
388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 33.2-33.54 and

Section 13:
33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect this change. Sections 33.57-

Section 14:
33.59 of this bill revise provisions governing certain duties of the superintendent of
schools of a large school district.
Existing law: (1) authorizes a local school precinct to carry forward its year-end
balance to the next school year for use by the local school precinct; and (2) requires
a local school precinct that carries forward a balance that exceeds 5 percent of its
actual expenditures to use the money for certain purposes. (NRS 388G.650)

Section 15:
Section 33.56 of this bill authorizes a large school district to intervene to require a
local school precinct to spend any money carried forward for certain purposes.
Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an
organizational team for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the
position of principal for a local school precinct (NRS 388G.740) Section 33.8 of
this bill revises these provisions.
Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
(2) establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on
behalf of a pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a
scholarship organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing
certain information. (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes
certain reporting requirements for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of
this bill requires such schools to administer certain examinations and assessments
to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each school that receives such a
grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section 32 of this bill
applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections 30-

Section 16:
31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)
Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections

Section 17:
31.2-31.7 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
Statutes. Section 31.2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
Department by submitting certain information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a
registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department certain
information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and (2) the
Department to compile certain information submitted by each scholarship
organization and review the information to determine whether to recommend a
change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5 requires
a registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6 requires the Department of Education
to: (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a summary
of certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.

Section 18:
Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a
scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.

Section 19:
Section 31.8 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to the provisions that may be cited
as the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain
limitations on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or
-
83rd Session (2025)

assessment; and (2) the number of examinations or assessments administered in a
school year. (NRS 390.805) Section 35 of this bill establishes additional
requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain reporting
requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare for and conduct
examinations and assessments.

Section 20:
Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and
Retention within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the
Commission; and (3) require the Commission to study issues relating to the
recruitment and retention of educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals
provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher and Education Support Professional
Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby dissolving the Task
Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the
State Board, for licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011,

Section 21:
391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this bill requires the Commission to establish
requirements for a person to obtain a provisional license with an endorsement as a
registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization for the State Board to
disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections 39-42 of this bill
make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority granted to the State
Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of certain
reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill
requires the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each
provider approved by the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training.
(NRS 391.039) Section 48 of this bill eliminates the requirement that certain
reports concerning a shortage of teachers be submitted to the State Board.
(NRS 391.125)
Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
(NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if certain conditions are met.
Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of
this bill makes certain requirements governing the standards and instruction for
English language arts. Section 33.93 of this bill requires the Department, to the
extent that money is available for such a purpose, to establish a pilot program under
which schools or groups of schools may apply to the Department for grants to
integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics into instruction in
literacy. Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State Board to use the results of the
pilot program to determine whether model curriculum for English language arts
should include phonics-based instruction and the integration of science, technology,
-

engineering and mathematics into English language arts in kindergarten and grades
1, 2 and 3.

Section 22:
Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
pupils or other school employees if: (1) the school employee is acting within the
course and scope of his or her employment and within the course and scope of his
or her role in maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of
the school employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the
policies of the school district or school at which the school employee is employed;
and (3) any harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful,
grossly negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to
the rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this
immunity from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
educational personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a
license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in
elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require
the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the Nevada System
of Higher Education to collaborate with the Department and the Commission to
establish such courses.
Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section

Section 23:
52.5 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an
additional probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary
employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that
additional probationary period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may
notify the employee that the employee may not be reemployed for the next contract
year; or (2) the superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of
dismissing the employee during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a school
district does not reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is
required to provide: (1) the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and
hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school
leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in
managing transitions and improving teaching practices.

Section 24:
Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
period of probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a
postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a performance
improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to

Section 25:
section 38.7 of this bill. Under section 38.8, at the conclusion of the period of
probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must be evaluated.
If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate progress toward
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 9 –
meeting improvement goals, section 38.8 authorizes the teacher to not be
reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary employee.

Section 26:
Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to

Section 27:
sections 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track
certain data relating to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for
school administrators, assess the effectiveness of such programs and make
recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 56.2 of this bill requires the board of trustees of
each school district and the governing body of each charter school to ensure that
teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of
schools in which such pupils are enrolled, certain other administrators and
paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils complete a course of professional
development training in the science of reading that is approved by the Department.
Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a
teacher or other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of
Public Instruction a complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission
authorizing the Superintendent to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository
for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal history of the
applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
“FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 179A.075,

Section 28:
391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an applicant
for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a
report on the criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill
authorizes the Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in
the in the Rap Back Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) for the purpose of enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status
notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed by the Superintendent.
Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for the issuance of
a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the
Rap Back Program; and (2) the Central Repository must establish certain methods
of handling such fingerprints. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of
such criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in
the system when a person is no longer licensed. Section 60 additionally requires the
Department to obtain consent from a person before submitting his or her
fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under section 83, persons who
are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes
effective are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the
time of the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would
not submit fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a
conforming change related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that
fingerprints for a background check would no longer be submitted with a renewal
application when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS 391.040)

Section 29:
Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a
person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment
after certain leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check
because the Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through
the Rap Back Program. (NRS 391.104)

The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a
superintendent of schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board
of trustees of a school district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to comply with certain requirements
when hiring a superintendent of schools.
Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance
evaluation system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation
of probationary teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how
pupil growth is calculated for the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this
bill revises the observation cycles for probationary teachers.

Section 30:
Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational
growth, rather than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480)

Section 31:
Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the change made in

Section 32:
section 50.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
retention of licensed teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of
this bill requires each large school district to establish through negotiations with an
employee organization a differential pay scale for certain licensed educational
personnel assigned to certain Title I schools. Section 56 of this bill requires the
board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each fiscal year an
amount of money sufficient to provide such a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill
defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of
this bill requires the differential pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory
collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill clarifies the manner in which the
provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional
development of teachers and administrators to provide certain training for
educational personnel. (NRS 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain
requirements for such training.
Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to
provide for the establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of
Regents whose duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59
of this bill requires the Board of Regents, in consultation with the Department, to
develop a method for sharing with the Department certain numbers used for the
identification of students.

Section 33:
Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System
of Higher Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for
assessing the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative
assessment methods; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a
summary of a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS

Section 34:
354.6015) Section 67 of this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of
trustees of school districts.
Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by
the Labor Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with
the advice and guidance of the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110,

Section 35:
610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill create the Nevada Registered
Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada Registered Teacher
Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the State
Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Department of Education, which consists of the
State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS
385.010) Existing law: (1) requires the State Board to prepare a plan to improve the
academic achievement of pupils; and (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan.
(NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also requires the board of trustees of each
school district and the governing bodies of certain charter schools to prepare an
annual report of accountability that contains certain information, including, without
limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational personnel and
paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)
Section 1.3 of this bill: (1) requires each public elementary school to prepare a
plan to improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary
schools; (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan, including, without
limitation, certain goals for public elementary schools; and (3) establishes
requirements governing the consequences for the principal of a public elementary
school that does not meet such goals. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill make changes
regarding the entity required to prepare such a plan pursuant to existing law.
(NRS 385.111)
Section 1.7 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
information or data that is used by the Department, the State Board or any other
person or entity to support educational outcomes.
Existing law creates the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in
Education for the purpose of developing a statewide vision and implementation
plan to improve public education in this State. (NRS 385.920) Section 5.5 of this
bill revises the duties of the Commission.
Section 6.1 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to
existing law and section 1.3. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain
requirements governing the annual report of accountability to the reporting
requirements set forth in section 6.1. Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by
which teacher vacancies are measured for inclusion in the annual report of
accountability.
Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 6.2-6.4 and 8.5 of
this bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts and charter
schools in this State. Section 6.5 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for
the Superintendent to designate a school district or sponsor of a charter school as
low-performing or underperforming. Section 9.3 of this bill requires: (1) the
Superintendent to place a school district or sponsor of a charter school designated
as underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings; and
(2) such a school district or sponsor to submit to the Department a school district or
sponsor of a charter school performance improvement plan and a school board or
sponsor of a charter school improvement plan. Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes the
Superintendent to take certain actions if the board of trustees of a school district or
sponsor of a charter school does not make adequate progress toward meeting the
goals and benchmarks necessary to improve the performance of the school district
or charter school. Section 9.7 of this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a
-

school district or sponsor of a charter school designated as underperforming on
probation if the designation was based on certain findings relating to the
performance of pupils; and (2) such a school district or sponsor to submit certain
plans to the Superintendent. Section 9.7 also establishes the actions that the
Superintendent is authorized to take if the school district or sponsor of a charter
school does not make adequate progress toward improving the performance of
pupils.
Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as
low-performing, and sections 14.25-14.4 of this bill prescribe the actions that may
be taken with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or
persistently underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a
process for state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school
that is designated as persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes
provisions governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key
members of the staff of a school. Section 14.4 establishes provisions governing the
corrective measure of the direct management of a school by the Department.
Section 56.5 of this bill: (1) creates the Education Service Center; (2) provides for
the appointment of a governing body for the Center; and (3) requires the Center to
provide certain assistance and guidance to public schools and school districts that
are experiencing low performance.
Section 9.3 requires the Superintendent to place certain underperforming
school districts or sponsors of charter schools on probation.
Section 84.5 of this bill requires the Legislative Counsel to, in preparing the
Nevada Revised Statutes, substitute the term: (1) “focus” for the term “low-
performing” as previously used in reference to a low-performing school district,
sponsor of a charter school or school; and (2) “priority” for the term
“underperforming” as previously used in reference to an underperforming school
district or sponsor of a charter school or persistently underperforming school.
(NRS 220.120)
Existing law provides that, on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
trustees of each school district and the State Public Charter School Authority is
required to prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of
accountability concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district
or charter school. (NRS 385A.070) Sections 7.4 and 7.5 of this bill revise certain
provisions governing the report.
Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such
school districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9.1
of this bill provides for the impaneling of a Public Education Oversight Board
under certain circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the
authority granted to the board of trustees of a school district to take actions
necessary to remedy the cause of recommendations submitted by the
Superintendent of Public Instruction. Section 9.1 additionally sets forth: (1) the
membership of the Board; and (2) requirements for meetings of the Board.
Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each
county school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only
the Clark County School District); (2) provides that four members of such a board
of trustees are appointed, nonvoting members; and (3) sets forth requirements for
electing officers of any board of trustees of a school district. (NRS 386.120,
386.165, 386.310) Section 10 of this bill: (1) provides that such appointed,
nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the prohibition
on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to
serve as officers.

Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill
requires the Commission to: (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the
method of calculating the percentage of at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a
third party to verify such methods and to submit a report containing the findings
and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62 of this bill
authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions
governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an
interim study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and
authorizes the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter
schools and nonprofit organizations to support early childhood literacy and
readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-387.1277) Existing law additionally requires
the Department, to the extent money is available, to award grants to school districts,
sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit organizations to support prekindergarten
programs. (NRS 387.652) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends eligibility to receive
grants to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs to institutions
within the Nevada System of Higher Education; and (2) expands the categories of
children served by such a program. Section 13.5 of this bill creates similar
provisions for grants to support prekindergarten programs.
Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain
classes not exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a
variance to a school district that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school
year. (NRS 388.700). Section 16 of this bill requires requests for, and reports
concerning, variances of requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher to
be submitted annually rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make
conforming changes to reflect the change to the timelines for such submissions.
(NRS 388.723, 388.725)
Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Section 8.3 of this bill requires the statewide
system of accountability for public schools to include, for elementary schools,
targets for the proportion of pupils demonstrating adequate proficiency in the
subject area of reading and adequate progress to achieving such proficiency.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or the governing
body of a charter school to prepare a plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled
in an elementary school that includes procedures to assess the proficiency of a pupil
in reading by using assessments that have been approved by the State Board. (NRS
388.157) Section 15.6 of this bill removes the requirement that such assessments be
approved by the State Board thereby allowing the board of trustees of a school
district or the governing body of a charter school, as applicable, to include in the
plan any valid and reliable standards-based assessment to assess proficiency in
reading. This bill also authorizes the Department of Education to: (1) adopt
regulations prescribing how the results of any assessment used by a school district
or charter school to assess proficiency in reading are collected and reported; and (2)
prescribe the assessments which must be used in a school district or charter school
if no assessment is included in the plan.
Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of
days in a school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
year to contain at least 4 days of professional development for elementary school
staff and prescribes the focus of such professional development.
Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to
employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive
program for school counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each
public school located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
Clark and Washoe Counties) to provide for the availability of a school counselor or
an equivalent service.
Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes
the membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law
additionally sets forth the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter
school and amending a charter contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276,
388A.279) Existing law further requires the sponsor of a charter school to submit a
report containing certain information to the Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section
20 of this bill changes the membership of the Authority. Section 19 of this bill
authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to object to the placement
of a proposed charter school. Sections 21 and 23 of this bill revise certain
requirements relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter school;
(2) the review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration
of such an application. Section 25 of this bill requires the Authority to take certain
actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it
sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a
charter school to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all
revenues for the charter school.
Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the
charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the
charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter
school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) Section 25.3 of
this bill: (1) instead provides that the sponsor of a charter school is required to
terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter
contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating underperformance
of the charter school in 3 consecutive years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on
using the rating of a charter school issued for any school year before the 2015-2016
school year for making such a determination. Sections 25.3 and 25.5 of this bill
also provide that, until October 1, 2027, the sponsor of such a charter school is not
required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public
schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from the
immediately preceding school year by a certain percentage.
Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction
at a charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS
388A.518) Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any
teacher who provides instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or
endorsement. Section 27 of this bill provides that the governing body of a charter
school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of pupils if the rules are not more
restrictive than those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional public schools,
thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing body of a
charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS
392.130-392.220)
Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this
State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently
the Clark County School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS
388G.530, 388G.600) Under existing law, a local school precinct is required to
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 6 –
operate using site-based decision-making in which certain responsibilities are
transferred from the large school district to the local school precinct. (NRS
388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 33.2-33.54 and
33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect this change. Sections 33.57-
33.59 of this bill revise provisions governing certain duties of the superintendent of
schools of a large school district.
Existing law: (1) authorizes a local school precinct to carry forward its year-end
balance to the next school year for use by the local school precinct; and (2) requires
a local school precinct that carries forward a balance that exceeds 5 percent of its
actual expenditures to use the money for certain purposes. (NRS 388G.650)
Section 33.56 of this bill authorizes a large school district to intervene to require a
local school precinct to spend any money carried forward for certain purposes.
Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an
organizational team for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the
position of principal for a local school precinct (NRS 388G.740) Section 33.8 of
this bill revises these provisions.
Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
(2) establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on
behalf of a pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a
scholarship organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing
certain information. (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes
certain reporting requirements for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of
this bill requires such schools to administer certain examinations and assessments
to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each school that receives such a
grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section 32 of this bill
applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections 30-
31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)
Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections
31.2-31.7 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised
Statutes. Section 31.2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the
Department by submitting certain information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a
registered scholarship organization to provide to the Department certain
information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom it awards a grant; and (2) the
Department to compile certain information submitted by each scholarship
organization and review the information to determine whether to recommend a
change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5 requires
a registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of each
donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward a
donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6 requires the Department of Education
to: (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a summary
of certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which
a scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a
scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils.
Section 31.8 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to the provisions that may be cited
as the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain
limitations on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –
assessment; and (2) the number of examinations or assessments administered in a
school year. (NRS 390.805) Section 35 of this bill establishes additional
requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain reporting
requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare for and conduct
examinations and assessments.
Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and
Retention within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the
Commission; and (3) require the Commission to study issues relating to the
recruitment and retention of educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals
provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher and Education Support Professional
Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby dissolving the Task
Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the
State Board, for licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011,
391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this bill requires the Commission to establish
requirements for a person to obtain a provisional license with an endorsement as a
registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization for the State Board to
disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections 39-42 of this bill
make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority granted to the State
Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of certain
reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill
requires the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each
provider approved by the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training.
(NRS 391.039) Section 48 of this bill eliminates the requirement that certain
reports concerning a shortage of teachers be submitted to the State Board.
(NRS 391.125)
Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
(NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if certain conditions are met.
Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of
this bill makes certain requirements governing the standards and instruction for
English language arts. Section 33.93 of this bill requires the Department, to the
extent that money is available for such a purpose, to establish a pilot program under
which schools or groups of schools may apply to the Department for grants to
integrate science, technology, engineering and mathematics into instruction in
literacy. Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State Board to use the results of the
pilot program to determine whether model curriculum for English language arts
should include phonics-based instruction and the integration of science, technology,

engineering and mathematics into English language arts in kindergarten and grades
1, 2 and 3.
Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
pupils or other school employees if: (1) the school employee is acting within the
course and scope of his or her employment and within the course and scope of his
or her role in maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of
the school employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the
policies of the school district or school at which the school employee is employed;
and (3) any harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful,
grossly negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to
the rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this
immunity from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
educational personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a
license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in
elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require
the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the Nevada System
of Higher Education to collaborate with the Department and the Commission to
establish such courses.
Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section
52.5 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an
additional probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary
employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that
additional probationary period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may
notify the employee that the employee may not be reemployed for the next contract
year; or (2) the superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of
dismissing the employee during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a school
district does not reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is
required to provide: (1) the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and
hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school
leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in
managing transitions and improving teaching practices.
Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
period of probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a
postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a performance
improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to
section 38.7 of this bill. Under section 38.8, at the conclusion of the period of
probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must be evaluated.
If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate progress toward
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
meeting improvement goals, section 38.8 authorizes the teacher to not be
reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary employee.
Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
sections 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track
certain data relating to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for
school administrators, assess the effectiveness of such programs and make
recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
training. (NRS 391A.370) Section 56.2 of this bill requires the board of trustees of
each school district and the governing body of each charter school to ensure that
teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of
schools in which such pupils are enrolled, certain other administrators and
paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils complete a course of professional
development training in the science of reading that is approved by the Department.
Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a
teacher or other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of
Public Instruction a complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission
authorizing the Superintendent to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository
for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal history of the
applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
“FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 179A.075,
391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an applicant
for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a
report on the criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill
authorizes the Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in
the in the Rap Back Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) for the purpose of enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status
notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed by the Superintendent.
Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for the issuance of
a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the
Rap Back Program; and (2) the Central Repository must establish certain methods
of handling such fingerprints. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of
such criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in
the system when a person is no longer licensed. Section 60 additionally requires the
Department to obtain consent from a person before submitting his or her
fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under section 83, persons who
are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes
effective are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the
time of the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would
not submit fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a
conforming change related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that
fingerprints for a background check would no longer be submitted with a renewal
application when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS 391.040)
Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a
person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment
after certain leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check
because the Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through
the Rap Back Program. (NRS 391.104)

The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a
superintendent of schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board
of trustees of a school district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to comply with certain requirements
when hiring a superintendent of schools.
Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance
evaluation system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation
of probationary teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how
pupil growth is calculated for the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this
bill revises the observation cycles for probationary teachers.
Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational
growth, rather than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480)
Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the change made in
section 50.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
retention of licensed teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of
this bill requires each large school district to establish through negotiations with an
employee organization a differential pay scale for certain licensed educational
personnel assigned to certain Title I schools. Section 56 of this bill requires the
board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each fiscal year an
amount of money sufficient to provide such a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill
defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of
this bill requires the differential pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory
collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill clarifies the manner in which the
provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional
development of teachers and administrators to provide certain training for
educational personnel. (NRS 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain
requirements for such training.
Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to
provide for the establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of
Regents whose duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59
of this bill requires the Board of Regents, in consultation with the Department, to
develop a method for sharing with the Department certain numbers used for the
identification of students.
Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System
of Higher Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for
assessing the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative
assessment methods; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a
summary of a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS
354.6015) Section 67 of this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of
trustees of school districts.
Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by
the Labor Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with
the advice and guidance of the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110,
610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill create the Nevada Registered
Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada Registered Teacher
Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the State
Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
Sections 71-78.8 of this bill make certain appropriations for various purposes
related to education.

3. The superintendent of schools of a school district and the
sponsor of a charter school shall, for each public elementary
school within the school district or sponsored by the sponsor, as
applicable, that does not meet the goals set forth pursuant to
paragraph (b) of subsection 1 in 3 consecutive school years:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 12 –
(a) Provide additional support for the administration of the
school, including, without limitation:
(1) Increased assistance and monitoring of school progress;
(2) Instructional or academic support; and
(3) Requesting guidance from the Education Service Center

recommendations on strategies and interventions for school
improvement.
(b) Assess the performance of the principal of the public
school and his or her responsibility for the failure of the school to
meet the goals set forth pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1.
The superintendent of schools of the school district or the
executive director of the charter school may, to assess the
performance of the principal pursuant to this paragraph, consider
the rate of chronic absenteeism, as defined by the Department
pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 392.150, at the public school. If
the superintendent or executive director of the charter school
determines that the principal is ineffective and responsible for the
failure, the board of trustees must, except as otherwise provided in
paragraph (c), remove the principal from his or her position. A
principal who is removed from his or her position pursuant to this
paragraph may apply for another position within the school
district or charter school, as applicable.
(c) If the principal of the school is not removed from his or her
position pursuant to paragraph (b), the principal must reapply to
the board of trustees of the school district for his or her current
position.
4. A principal who is the subject of a performance assessment
conducted pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3 and is not
removed from his or her position must:
(a) Every 2 years after receiving the performance assessment,

did not meet the goals set forth pursuant to paragraph (b) of
subsection 1.
(b) Prepare and submit a report to the Department containing
a plan for annual growth that describes any additional supports
provided by the school district. The report must be submitted each
school year in which the principal remains in his or her current
position, unless the school to which the principal is assigned meets
the goals in the plan prepared pursuant to subsection 1. The
Department shall examine the plan submitted pursuant to this
-

paragraph and determine any adjustments necessary for the
school to meet the goals in the plan prepared pursuant to
subsection 1.
5. If the performance of the principal is assessed pursuant to
paragraph (b) of subsection 3 as minimally effective or ineffective,
the superintendent of schools of the school district or the executive
director of the sponsor of the charter school, as applicable, shall
prepare and submit a report to the Department containing a plan
for annual growth that describes any additional supports provided
by the school district or sponsor of the charter school and any
recommendations from the Education Service Center created by
section 56.5 of this act. The report must be submitted each school
year in which the principal remains in his or her position unless
the school to which the principal is assigned meets the goals in the
plan prepared pursuant to subsection 1. The Department shall
examine the plan submitted pursuant to this subparagraph and
determine whether any adjustments are necessary for the school to
meet the goals set forth in the plan prepared pursuant to
subsection 1.
Sec. 1.7. 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
(a) Enhance the efficiency of education reporting
requirements by eliminating the reporting of redundant
information and data, reducing administrative burdens and
ensuring that all reports serve a meaningful purpose in supporting
educational outcomes.
(b) Ensure that teachers and school administrators, who are
directly impacted by reporting requirements, have agency in
recommending modifications to reporting requirements.
(c) Preserve transparency, the accountability of public schools
and school districts for the quality of schools and the educational
achievement of pupils, and the accessibility of information and
data concerning the educational achievement of pupils.
2. A teacher or school administrator employed at a public
school, a charter management organization that operates a
charter school or an educational management organization that
provides support or operations to a charter school may submit a
petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public
school or school district to report information or data to another
person or entity. Such a petition must be submitted to the
superintendent of schools of the school district in which the public
school is located or, if the public school is a charter school, the
governing body of the charter school. The petition must:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 14 –
(a) Clearly identify the requirement to report information or
data that the petitioner is seeking to modify, suspend or eliminate;
(b) Contain a detailed explanation of the reason that the
requirement to report information or data is duplicative or
redundant or does not provide information or data that is used by
the Department, the State Board or any other person or entity to
support educational outcomes; and
(c) Propose an alternative report of information or data, if any,
