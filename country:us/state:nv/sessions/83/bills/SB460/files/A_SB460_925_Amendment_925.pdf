31 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools that
32 includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school based on the
33 performance of the school and on whether each public school meets the school
34 achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the statewide
35 system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 8.5 of this bill
36 establish a similar system of accountability for school districts and charter schools in this
37 State. Section 6.5 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for the Superintendent

51 to submit certain plans to the Superintendent. Section 9.7 also establishes the actions
52 that the Superintendent is authorized to take if the school district or sponsor of a charter
53 school does not make adequate progress toward improving the performance of pupils.
54 Section 6.6 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as low-
55 performing, and sections 14.25-14.65 of this bill prescribe the actions that may be taken
56 with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or persistently
57 underperforming. Section 14.3 requires the Superintendent to initiate a process for state
58 intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school that is designated as
59 persistently underperforming. Section 14.35 establishes provisions governing the
60 corrective measure of replacing the principal and key members of the staff of a school.

87 District); (2) provides that four members of such a board of trustees are appointed, nonvoting
88 members; and (3) sets forth requirements for electing officers of any board of trustees of a

90 such appointed, nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the
91 prohibition on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
92 bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to serve as
93 officers.

101 provisions governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
102 pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an interim
103 study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
104 Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and authorizes
105 the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit
106 organizations to support early childhood literacy and readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-

120 bill sets forth requirements for the ratio of teachers per administrator in each elementary
121 school within a school district [.] in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
122 (currently only Clark County). Section 16 of this bill [: (1) prohibits the State Board from
123 granting a variance of requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher unless the

126 licensed teacher to be submitted annually rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill
127 make conforming changes to reflect the change to the timelines for such submissions. (NRS
128 388.723, 388.725)
129 Existing law provides certain exceptions to the requirement that a pupil attend a
130 public school in his or her zone of attendance. (NRS 388.040) Section 14.7 of this bill

133 transportation to a school he or she attends outside of his or her zone of attendance.
134 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
135 intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the pupil
136 does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-referenced
137 examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State Board. (NRS
138 388A.487, 392.760) Section 14.2 of this bill requires: (1) a service provider to register
139 with the school district to be eligible to provide literacy intervention, tutoring and
140 related services to pupils; and (2) such services to be scientifically based and to meet

142 public schools to include, for elementary schools, targets for the proportion of pupils
143 demonstrating adequate proficiency in the subject area of reading and adequate
144 progress to achieving such proficiency.
145 Existing law makes certain requirements governing the minimum number of days in
146 a school year. (NRS 388.090) Section 15.5 of this bill requires each school year to contain
147 at least 4 days of professional development for elementary school staff and prescribes the
148 focus of such professional development.
149 Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to employ a
150 school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive program for school
151 counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each public school located in a
152 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to
153 [comply with such requirements, thereby requiring money to be made available for such
154 programs in those school districts.] provide for the availability of a school counselor or an
155 equivalent service.
156 Existing law creates the State Public Charter School Authority and prescribes the
157 membership of the Authority. (NRS 388A.150, 388A.153) Existing law additionally sets forth
158 the requirements for the process of applying to form a charter school and amending a charter
159 contract. (NRS 388A.243-388A.258, 388A.276, 388A.279) Existing law further requires the
160 sponsor of a charter school to submit a report containing certain information to the
161 Department. (NRS 388A.351) Section 20 of this bill changes the membership of the
162 Authority. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to
163 object to the placement of a proposed charter school. Sections 21-23 of this bill revise certain
164 requirements relating to: (1) the contents of an application to form a charter school; (2) the
165 review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration of such an
166 application. [Sections 24 and] Section 25 of this bill [require] requires the Authority to take
167 certain actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter school it

Senate Amendment No. 925 to Senate Bill No. 460 Page 7
168 sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor of a charter school
169 to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all revenues for the charter school.
170 Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction at a
171 charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS 388A.518)
172 Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any teacher who provides
173 instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or endorsement. Section 27 of this bill
174 provides that the governing body of a charter school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of
175 pupils if the rules are [as] not more restrictive [as] than those set forth for pupils enrolled in
176 traditional public schools, thereby removing the authority under existing law for the governing
177 body of a charter school to adopt more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS
178 392.130-392.220)
179 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this State
180 which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark
181 County School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS 388G.530,
182 388G.600) Under existing law, a local school precinct is required to operate using site-
183 based decision-making in which certain responsibilities are transferred from the large
184 school district to the local school precinct. (NRS 388G.600) Section 85 of this bill repeals
185 this authority. Sections 33.2-33.7 and 33.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect
186 this change.
187 Existing law sets forth requirements governing the involvement of an organizational
188 team for a local school precinct when a vacancy occurs in the position of principal for a

193 organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing certain information.
194 (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes certain reporting requirements
195 for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of this bill requires such schools to administer
196 certain examinations and assessments to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each
197 school that receives such a grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section
198 32 of this bill applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections
199 [30 and 31.] 30-31.7 of this bill. (NRS 388D.260)
200 Existing regulations include provisions governing the operation of the Nevada
201 Educational Choice Scholarship Program. (NAC 388D.030-388D.130) Sections 31.2-31.7
202 codify certain provisions of these regulations into the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section
203 31.2 requires a scholarship organization to register with the Department by submitting
204 certain information. Section 31.3 requires: (1) a registered scholarship organization to
205 provide to the Department certain information concerning each pupil on behalf of whom
206 it awards a grant; and (2) the Department to compile certain information submitted by
207 each scholarship organization and review the information to determine whether to
208 recommend a change to the Legislature in the priority for awarding grants. Section 31.5
209 requires a registered scholarship organization to notify the Department of Taxation of
210 each donation received and prohibits a scholarship organization from carrying forward
211 a donation for more than 5 years. Section 31.6 requires the Department of Education to:
212 (1) maintain a directory of each scholarship organization registered with the
213 Department; (2) submit a list of scholarship organizations registered with the
214 Department to the Department of Taxation each quarter; and (3) submit a summary of
215 certain reports made to the Department of Education to certain entities annually.
216 Section 31.7 authorizes the parent or guardian of a pupil to apply directly to a
217 scholarship organization for a grant and establishes the order of priority in which a
218 scholarship organization is required to award grants. Section 31.7 also requires a
219 scholarship organization to establish written procedures for determining whether a
220 pupil is qualified to receive a grant and awarding grants on behalf of pupils. Section 31.8
221 of this bill adds sections 31.2-31.7 to the provisions that may be cited as the Nevada
222 Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
223 Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain limitations
224 on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or assessment; and (2) the
225 number of examinations or assessments administered in a school year. (NRS 390.805) Section
226 35 of this bill establishes additional requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill

Senate Amendment No. 925 to Senate Bill No. 460 Page 8
227 sets forth certain reporting requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare
228 for and conduct examinations and assessments.
229 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and Retention
230 within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the Commission; and (3)
231 [requires] require the Commission to study issues relating to the recruitment and retention of
232 educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada State

234 thereby dissolving the Task Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
235 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
236 the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the State Board, for licensing
237 teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this
238 bill requires the Commission to establish requirements for a person to obtain a provisional
239 license with an endorsement as a registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization
240 for the State Board to disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections [39-
241 42] 39, 40, 41 and 42 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority
242 granted to the State Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of
243 certain reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill requires
244 the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each provider approved by
245 the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training. (NRS 391.039) Section 48 of
246 this bill eliminates the requirement that certain reports concerning a shortage of teachers be
247 submitted to the State Board. (NRS 391.125)
248 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city or
249 county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from sponsoring a
250 new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an additional campus of an
251 existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if the total number of pupils
252 enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or county exceeds a certain
253 percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the city or county other than in
254 charter schools not sponsored by the city or county. (NRS 388A.220) Section 20.5 of this
255 bill creates an exception to this prohibition by authorizing a city or county to sponsor a
256 new charter school or expand the enrollment or operate an additional campus of an
257 existing charter school sponsored by the city or county, regardless of the number of
258 pupils that will be enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if
259 certain conditions are met.
260 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English language
261 arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools; and (2) requires
262 the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to adopt standards of
263 content and performance for certain courses of study, including courses in the core
264 academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 33.97 of this bill makes certain
265 requirements governing the standards and instruction for English language arts. Section
266 33.93 of this bill requires the Department, to the extent that money is available for such a
267 purpose, to establish a pilot program under which schools or groups of schools may
268 apply to the Department for grants to integrate science, technology, engineering and
269 mathematics into instruction in literacy. Section 33.95 of this bill requires the State
270 Board to use the results of the pilot program to determine whether model curriculum for
271 English language arts should include phonics-based instruction and the integration of
272 science, technology, engineering and mathematics into English language arts in
273 kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3.
274 Section 38.2 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil and
275 criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical altercations,
276 fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of pupils or other
277 school employees if: (1) the school employee is acting within the course and scope of his
278 or her employment and within the course and scope of his or her role in maintaining
279 order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of the school employee are
280 consistent with state, federal and local laws and the policies of the school district or
281 school at which the school employee is employed; and (3) any harm caused by the
282 intervention is not the result of intentional, willful, grossly negligent or reckless
283 misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the person
284 harmed. Section 58.7 of this bill applies this immunity from civil and criminal liability to
285 employees of private schools.

Senate Amendment No. 925 to Senate Bill No. 460 Page 9
286 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
287 adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
288 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing regulations, a license to
289 teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach all subjects in elementary
290 grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 39, 41.5 and 41.6 of this bill require the Commission to
291 adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in kindergarten or grade
292 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to obtain an endorsement to teach
293 such pupils by successfully completing a course of instruction in foundational literacy
294 skills that is approved by the Commission and meets certain standards. Section 59.5 of
295 this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to require certain
296 institutions within the Nevada System of Higher Education to collaborate with the
297 Department and the Commission to establish such courses.
298 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
299 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to serve an
300 additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a period of
301 probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no right to
302 employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2) during the
303 contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after receiving notice and an
304 opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section 52.5 of this bill provides that if
305 a postprobationary employee is serving an additional probationary period under
306 existing law and the postprobationary employee receives a rating of ineffective for 2
307 consecutive years during that additional probationary period: (1) the board of trustees
308 of the school district may notify the employee that the employee will not be reemployed
309 for the next contract year; or (2) the superintendent of the school district may initiate
310 the process of dismissing the employee during a contract year. Under section 52.5, if a
311 school district does not reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is
312 required to provide: (1) the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and
313 hiring a highly effective administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school
314 leadership with access to certain coaching to assist the school leadership in managing
315 transitions and improving teaching practices.
316 Section 38.8 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
317 period of probation of 2 school years if certain conditions are met. If a postprobationary
318 teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a performance improvement plan must
319 be established for the postprobationary teacher pursuant to section 38.7 of this bill.
320 Under section 38.8, at the conclusion of the period of probation pursuant to that section,
321 the postprobationary teacher must be evaluated. If, based on that evaluation, the teacher
322 has not made adequate progress toward meeting improvement goals, section 38.8
323 authorizes the teacher to not be reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a
324 probationary employee.
325 Sections 38.3 and 38.4 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
326 sections 38.7 and 38.8. Section 38.6 of this bill requires the Department to track certain
327 data relating to the effectiveness of programs that provide training for school
328 administrators, assess the effectiveness of such programs and make recommendations
329 for the improvement of such programs.
330 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
331 body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the school district or
332 charter school have access to certain professional development training. (NRS 391A.370)
333 Section 56.2 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
334 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers who teach pupils in
335 kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of schools in which such pupils are
336 enrolled, certain other administrators and paraprofessionals who directly serve such
337 pupils complete a course of professional development training in the science of reading
338 that is approved by the Department.
339 Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a teacher or
340 other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction a
341 complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission authorizing the Superintendent
342 to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History
343 for its report on the criminal history of the applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau
344 of Investigation (hereinafter “FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant.

Senate Amendment No. 925 to Senate Bill No. 460 Page 10
345 (NRS 179A.075, 391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an
346 applicant for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
347 the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a report on the
348 criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill [requires] authorizes the
349 Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in the in the Rap Back
350 Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the purpose of
351 enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status notifications of any criminal history of a
352 person licensed by the Superintendent. Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an
353 applicant for the issuance of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be
354 retained in certain systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes
355 of the Rap Back Program; and (2) [if the Rap Back Program identifies a new criminal history
356 event for such a licensee, notice will be provided to] the Central Repository [and the Central
357 Repository is required to notify the Department that a licensee has a criminal history event.]
358 must establish certain methods of handling such fingerprints. Section 60 further provides
359 for the confidentiality of such criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints
360 maintained in the system when a person is no longer licensed. Section 60 additionally
361 requires the Department to obtain consent from a person before submitting his or her
362 fingerprints to the Central Repository and the FBI. Under section [84,] 83, persons who
363 are licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes effective are
364 required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the time of the first renewal
365 of their license after the Program is effective and would not submit fingerprints for subsequent
366 renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a conforming change related to fees for the renewal of
367 such a license to reflect that fingerprints for a background check would no longer be
368 submitted with a renewal application when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS
369 391.040) Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a
370 person who is licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment after certain
371 leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check because the Department
372 would be receiving notifications for such purposes through the Rap Back Program. (NRS
373 391.104)
374 The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a superintendent of
375 schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school
376 district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
377 Counties) to comply with certain [requires] requirements when hiring a superintendent of
378 schools.
379 Existing law: (1) requires the State board to establish a statewide performance evaluation
380 system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation of probationary
381 teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how pupil growth is calculated for
382 the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this bill revises the observation cycles for
383 probationary teachers.
384 Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational growth, rather
385 than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480) Section 51 of this bill makes
386 a conforming change to reflect the change made in section 50.
387 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a program
388 of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and retention of licensed
389 teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of this bill [: (1)] requires each large
390 school district to establish through negotiations with an employee organization a [salary
391 incentive program for professional growth for teachers and principals; and (2) sets forth
392 requirements for an agreement to provide a salary increase through the program.] differential
393 pay scale for certain licensed educational personnel assigned to certain Title I schools.
394 Section 56 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for
395 each fiscal year an amount of money sufficient to provide such [agreed upon increases in
396 salaries.] a pay scale. Section 54 of this bill defines “large school district” for the purposes of
397 sections 55 and 56. Section 66 of this bill requires the [salary incentive program] differential
398 pay scale to be within the scope of mandatory collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill
399 clarifies the manner in which the provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
400 Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional development of
401 teachers and administrators to provide certain training for educational personnel. (NRS
402 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for such training.

403 Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to provide for the
404 establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of Regents whose duties are
405 prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59 of this bill requires the Board of
406 Regents, in consultation with the Department, to develop a method for sharing with the
407 Department certain numbers used for the identification of students.
408 [Existing law: (1) requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct a performance audit of
409 certain school districts and the State Public Charter School Authority; and (2) sets forth the
410 schedule for conducting such performance audits. (NRS 218G.600) Section 64 of this bill sets
411 forth additional matters for the Legislative Auditor to evaluate when conducting such
412 performance audits.] Section 80 of this bill directs the [Legislative Auditor] Commission on
413 School Funding to perform certain tasks concerning the examination of resource levels and
414 funding levels that represent the best practices for adequately meeting the needs of pupils.
415 Section 81.5 of this bill: (1) authorizes institutions within the Nevada System of
416 Higher Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for
417 assessing the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative
418 assessment methods; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the program.
419 Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a summary of
420 a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS 354.6015) Section 67 of
421 this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of trustees of school districts.
422 Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by the Labor
423 Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with the advice and guidance of
424 the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110, 610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill
425 create the Nevada Registered Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada
426 Registered Teacher Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the
427 State Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
428 Sections [71-78] 71-78.8 of this bill make certain appropriations [to carry out the
429 provisions of this bill.] for various purposes related to education.
