4 academic achievement of pupils; and (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan.
5 (NRS 385.111, 385.112) Existing law also requires the board of trustees of each
6 school district and the governing bodies of certain charter schools to prepare an
7 annual report of accountability that contains certain information, including, without
8 limitation, information regarding teachers, other licensed educational personnel and
9 paraprofessionals. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.230)
10 Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires the State Board to prepare a separate plan to
11 improve the academic achievement of pupils enrolled in public elementary schools;
12 (2) sets forth the required contents of the plan, including, without limitation, certain
13 goals for public elementary schools; and (3) establishes requirements governing the
14 consequences for the principal of a public elementary school that does not meet
15 such goals. Section 3 of this bill requires that the plans to improve academic
16 achievement required pursuant to existing law and section 1 include requirements
17 concerning professional development. (NRS 385.111) Sections 4, 5 and 58 of this
18 bill make conforming changes to refer to the plans prepared pursuant to existing
19 law and section 1. (NRS 385.111)
20 Section 6 of this bill requires that the annual report of accountability include
21 information on the plans to improve academic achievement prepared pursuant to
22 existing law and section 1. (NRS 385.111) Section 7 of this bill applies certain
23 requirements governing the annual report of accountability to the reporting
24 requirements set forth in section 6. Section 8 of this bill revises the manner by
25 which teacher vacancies are measured for inclusion in the annual report of
26 accountability.
27 Existing law: (1) creates county school districts; and (2) provides that such
28 school districts are political subdivisions of this State. (NRS 386.010) Section 9 of
29 this bill provides for the impaneling of a School District Oversight Board under
30 certain circumstances and provides the Board, if impaneled, with the authority
31 granted to the board of trustees of a school district to take actions necessary to
32 remedy the cause of a state of emergency for a school district. Section 9
33 additionally sets forth: (1) the membership of the Board; and (2) requirements that
34 must be met before the Board is authorized to exercise its authority. Section 65 of
35 this bill provides that meetings of the Board must be open to the public but are
36 otherwise exempt from the provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (Chapter 241 of
37 NRS)
38 Existing law: (1) sets forth the membership of the board of trustees in each
39 county school district in which more than 75,000 pupils are enrolled (currently only
40 the Clark County School District); (2) provides that four members of such a board
41 of trustees are appointed, nonvoting members; and (3) sets forth requirements for
42 electing officers of any board of trustees of a school district. (NRS 386.120,
43 386.165, 386.310) Section 10 of this bill: (1) provides that such appointed,
-
*SB460*

– 3 –
44 nonvoting members are instead voting members; and (2) eliminates the prohibition
45 on the ability of such members to vote for or serve as officers. Section 11 of this
46 bill makes a conforming change to authorize the previously nonvoting members to
47 serve as officers.
48 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
49 duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 12 of this bill
50 requires the Commission to: (1) review and propose any necessary revisions to the
51 method of calculating the quintile of at-risk pupils in this State; and (2) select a

53 and recommendations for using a different method. Section 62 of this bill
54 authorizes the Commission to request the drafting of not more than 1 legislative
55 measure for a regular session. Section 63 of this bill applies existing provisions
56 governing the drafting of such measures to the drafting of a legislative measure
57 pursuant to section 62. Section 81 of this bill directs the Commission to conduct an
58 interim study concerning certain subjects relating to school funding.
59 Existing law creates the Early Childhood Literacy and Readiness Account and
60 authorizes the Department to award grants to school districts, sponsors of charter
61 schools and nonprofit organizations to support early childhood literacy and
62 readiness programs. (NRS 387.1271-387.1277) Section 13 of this bill: (1) extends
63 eligibility to receive such grants to private, for-profit organizations; and (2) requires
64 that all programs supported by such a grant serve a child, regardless of the
65 economic status of the child, at no cost to his or her parent or legal guardian.
66 Existing law: (1) requires that the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain
67 classes not exceed certain ratios; and (2) authorizes the State Board to grant a
68 variance to a school district that does not meet such ratios in a quarter of a school
69 year. (NRS 388.700) Section 14 of this bill sets forth requirements for the ratio of
70 teachers per administrator in each elementary school within a school district.
71 Section 16 of this bill: (1) prohibits the State Board from granting a variance of
72 requirements for the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher unless the school district

75 licensed teacher to be submitted annually rather than quarterly. Sections 17 and 18
76 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the change to the timelines for such
77 submissions. (NRS 388.723, 388.725)
78 Existing law requires a public school, to the extent that money is available, to
79 employ a school counselor on a full-time basis and provide for a comprehensive
80 program for school counseling. (NRS 388.055) Section 15 of this bill requires each
81 public school located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently

94 review of such an application; and (3) a public meeting for the consideration of
95 such an application. Sections 24 and 25 of this bill require the Authority to take
96 certain actions regarding a proposed amendment to a charter contract for a charter
97 school it sponsors. Section 26 of this bill requires a report prepared by the sponsor
-
*SB460*

– 4 –
98 of a charter school to include a description of the expenditures and sources of all
99 revenues for the charter school.
100 Existing law requires at least 80 percent of the teachers who provide instruction
101 at a charter school to hold a license or endorsement to teach in this State. (NRS
102 388A.518) Section 28 of this bill instead requires, with certain exceptions, that any
103 teacher who provides instruction at a charter school to hold such a license or
104 endorsement. Section 27 of this bill provides that the governing body of a charter
105 school may adopt rules relating to the truancy of pupils if the rules are as restrictive
106 as those set forth for pupils enrolled in traditional public schools, thereby removing
107 the authority under existing law for the governing body of a charter school to adopt
108 more restrictive rules relating to the truancy of pupils. (NRS 392.130-392.220)
109 Existing law: (1) creates the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
110 (2) establishes requirements for a scholarship organization that provides grants on
111 behalf of a pupil to a school in which the pupil is enrolled; and (3) requires such a
112 scholarship organization to submit an annual report to the Department containing
113 certain information. (NRS 388D.250-388D.280) Section 30 of this bill establishes
114 certain reporting requirements for schools that receive such grants. Section 31 of
115 this bill requires such schools to administer certain examinations and assessments
116 to certain pupils. Section 33 of this bill requires each school that receives such a
117 grant to comply with the provisions of sections 30 and 31. Section 32 of this bill
118 applies the definition of “scholarship organization” in existing law to sections 30
119 and 31. (NRS 388D.260)
120 Existing law requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing certain
121 limitations on: (1) the time taken from instruction to conduct an examination or
122 assessment; and (2) the number of examinations or assessments administered in a
123 school year. (NRS 390.805) Section 35 of this bill establishes additional
124 requirements for such regulations. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain reporting
125 requirements concerning the amount of class time used to prepare for and conduct
126 examinations and assessments.
127 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill: (1) create the Commission on Recruitment and
128 Retention within the Department; (2) set forth the membership and duties of the
129 Commission; and (3) requires the Commission to study issues relating to the
130 recruitment and retention of educators in this State. Section 85 of this bill repeals
131 provisions governing the Nevada State Teacher and Education Support Professional
132 Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force, thereby dissolving the Task
133 Force. (NRS 391.486-391.496)
134 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
135 and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations, subject to approval by the
136 State Board, for licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011,
137 391.019, 391.027) Section 39 of this bill requires the Commission to establish
138 requirements for a person to obtain a provisional license with an endorsement as a
139 registered apprentice. Section 85 repeals the authorization for the State Board to
140 disapprove any regulation adopted by the Commission. Sections 39-42 of this bill
141 make conforming changes to reflect the repeal of authority granted to the State
142 Board. Section 41 revises provisions governing the timing and content of certain
143 reports submitted by the Commission. (NRS 391.028) Section 44 of this bill
144 requires the Department, rather than the State Board, to annually evaluate each
145 provider approved by the Commission to offer certain courses of study or training.
146 (NRS 391.039) Section 48 of this bill eliminates the requirement that certain
147 reports concerning a shortage of teachers be submitted to the State Board.
148 (NRS 391.125)
149 Existing law requires an applicant for the issuance or renewal of a license as a
150 teacher or other educational personnel position to submit to the Superintendent of
151 Public Instruction a complete set of his or her fingerprints and written permission
152 authorizing the Superintendent to forward the fingerprints to the Central Repository
-
*SB460*

– 5 –
153 for Nevada Records of Criminal History for its report on the criminal history of the
154 applicant and for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter
155 “FBI”) for its report on the criminal history of the applicant. (NRS 179A.075,
156 391.033) Sections 43 and 61 of this bill remove the requirement for an applicant
157 for the renewal of a license as a teacher or other educational personnel to submit to
158 the Superintendent a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose of obtaining a
159 report on the criminal history of the applicant. Instead, section 60 of this bill
160 requires the Central Repository and the Department of Education to participate in
161 the in the Rap Back Program administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
162 (FBI) for the purpose of enabling the Department to obtain ongoing status
163 notifications of any criminal history of a person licensed by the Superintendent.
164 Under section 60: (1) any fingerprints submitted by an applicant for the issuance of
165 a license as a teacher or other educational personnel will be retained in certain
166 systems maintained by the Central Repository and the FBI for the purposes of the
167 Rap Back Program; and (2) if the Rap Back Program identifies a new criminal
168 history event for such a licensee, notice will be provided to the Central Repository
169 and the Central Repository is required to notify the Department that a licensee has a
170 criminal history event. Section 60 further provides for the confidentiality of such
171 criminal history information and the destruction of fingerprints maintained in the
172 system when a person is no longer licensed. Under section 84, persons who are
173 licensed by the Superintendent at the time the Rap Back Program becomes effective
174 are required to submit fingerprints for the purposes of the Program at the time of
175 the first renewal of their license after the Program is effective and would not submit
176 fingerprints for subsequent renewals. Section 45 of this bill makes a conforming
177 change related to fees for the renewal of such a license to reflect that fingerprints
178 for a background check would no longer be submitted with a renewal application
179 when the Rap Back Program becomes effective. (NRS 391.040) Section 46 of this
180 bill makes a conforming change to remove a requirement for a person who is
181 licensed by the Superintendent and who is returned to employment after certain
182 leave to submit fingerprints for the purposes of a background check because the
183 Department would be receiving notifications for such purposes through the Rap
184 Back Program. (NRS 391.104)
185 The board of trustees of a school district is authorized to employ a
186 superintendent of schools. (NRS 391.110) Section 47 of this bill requires the board
187 of trustees of a school district located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
188 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to comply with certain requires when
189 hiring a superintendent of schools.

191 evaluation system and; (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the evaluation
192 of probationary teachers. (391.465, 391.685) Section 49 of this bill changes how
193 pupil growth is calculated for the purposes of such an evaluation. Section 52 of this
194 bill revises the observation cycles for probationary teachers.
195 Section 50 of this bill requires a teacher to develop goals for educational
196 growth, rather than learning goals, for each of his or her pupils. (NRS 391.480)
197 Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the change made in
198 section 50.
199 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
200 program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
201 retention of licensed teachers and administrators. (NRS 391A.450) Section 55 of
202 this bill: (1) requires each large school district to establish through negotiations
203 with an employee organization a salary incentive program for professional growth
204 for teachers and principals; and (2) sets forth requirements for an agreement to
205 provide a salary increase through the program. Section 56 of this bill requires the
206 board of trustees of each large school district to reserve for each fiscal year an
207 amount of money sufficient to provide such agreed upon increases in salaries.

208 Section 54 of this bill defines “large school district” for the purposes of sections 55
209 and 56. Section 66 of this bill requires the salary incentive program to be within
210 the scope of mandatory collective bargaining. Section 79 of this bill clarifies the
211 manner in which the provisions of section 55 applies to any existing contracts.
212 Existing law requires a regional training program for the professional
213 development of teachers and administrators to provide certain training for
214 educational personnel. (NRS 391A.125) Section 57 of this bill sets forth certain
215 requirements for such training.
216 Article 11 of the Nevada Constitution requires the Nevada Legislature to
217 provide for the establishment of a State University that is controlled by a Board of
218 Regents whose duties are prescribed by law. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, § 4) Section 59
219 of this bill requires the Board of Regents, in consultation with the Department, to
220 develop a method for sharing with the Department certain numbers used for the
221 identification of students.
222 Existing law: (1) requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct a performance
223 audit of certain school districts and the State Public Charter School Authority; and
224 (2) sets forth the schedule for conducting such performance audits. (NRS
225 218G.600) Section 64 of this bill sets forth additional matters for the Legislative
226 Auditor to evaluate when conducting such performance audits. Section 80 of this
227 bill directs the Legislative Auditor to perform certain tasks concerning the
228 examination of resource levels and funding levels that represent the best practices
229 for adequately meeting the needs of pupils.
230 Existing law requires the governing board of a local government to publish a
231 summary of a fiscal report of the local government in a certain newspaper. (NRS
232 354.6015) Section 67 of this bill eliminates such a requirement for the boards of
233 trustees of school districts.
234 Under existing law, the apprenticeship program in Nevada is administered by
235 the Labor Commissioner as the ex officio State Apprenticeship Director with
236 the advice and guidance of the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.110,
237 610.120) Sections 69 and 70 of this bill create the Nevada Registered
238 Teacher Apprenticeship Support Account and the Nevada Registered Teacher
239 Apprenticeship Support Program, respectively. Section 69 requires the State
240 Apprenticeship Director to administer the Account.
