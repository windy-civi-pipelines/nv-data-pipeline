(BDR 16-296)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; revising requirements relating to the
provision of certain medical services to women in the
custody of the Department of Corrections; revising
provisions relating to notarial acts performed for persons
incarcerated in the state prison; eliminating the
requirement that the Director of the Department establish
and administer a program of regimental discipline; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who
2 is incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care
3 services. (NRS 209.3817) Section 1 of this bill requires that any such access be
4 provided in accordance with community standards of care and national guidelines
5 for the provision of such services. Section 1 also removes specific language
6 requiring this access to include an annual pelvic examination and mammography,
7 thereby requiring the Department to provide a woman who is incarcerated access to
8 a pelvic examination and mammography in accordance with community standards
9 of care and national guidelines for the provision of pelvic examinations and
10 mammography, rather than on an annual basis.
11 Existing law contains the Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, which provides the
12 manner in which notarial acts must be performed, including that a notarial officer
13 determine, from personal knowledge or satisfactory evidence, that a person is the
14 person whose signature is on a document. (NRS 240.161-240.169, 240.1655)
15 Section 5 of this bill provides that a notarial officer has satisfactory evidence that a
16 person who is incarcerated in the state prison is the person whose signature is on a
17 document if the person is identified upon the basis of: (1) an inmate identification
18 card that is issued by the Department in accordance with regulations adopted by the
-
*AB25*

– 2 –
19 Department and includes the name and a picture of the person; or (2) a declaration
20 signed by the person under penalty of perjury attesting to his or her identity.
21 Existing law: (1) requires the Director of the Department to establish and
22 administer a program of regimental discipline to be used as an alternative to
23 incarceration; and (2) authorizes a court to order certain defendants to undergo the
24 program as an alternative to incarceration. (NRS 176A.630, 176A.770, 176A.780,
25 209.356) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill repeal this requirement and authorization.
26 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes by removing references to a
27 provision repealed by section 6.

-
*AB25*

– 5 –

7 address, which pertains to a victim and which is received by the
8 Division pursuant to this paragraph is confidential.
9 2. If the court finds that the probationer committed one or more

23 impose imprisonment for the remainder of the sentence for a fourth
24 or subsequent revocation; or
25 (e) Revoke the probation or suspension of sentence at the
26 request of the probationer. If the probation or suspension of sentence
27 is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the probationer must serve
28 such part of the unexpired maximum term or the maximum
29 aggregate term, as applicable, of his or her original sentence as may
30 be determined by the court.
31 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a probationer
32 who is arrested and detained for committing a technical violation of
33 the conditions of probation must be brought before the court not
34 later than 15 calendar days after the date of arrest and detention. If
35 the person is not brought before the court within 15 calendar days,
36 the probationer must be released from detention and returned to

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
176A.770 Legislative declaration. The Legislature hereby
determines and declares that a program of regimental discipline is
not to be used as an alternative to probation, but as an alternative to
incarceration.

time from sentence.
1. If a defendant:
(a) Is male;

 the court may order the defendant satisfactorily to complete a
program of regimental discipline for 150 days before sentencing the
defendant or in lieu of causing the sentence imposed to be executed
upon violation of a condition of probation or suspension of sentence.
2. If the court orders the defendant to undergo a program of
regimental discipline, it:
(a) Shall place the defendant under the supervision of the
Director of the Department of Corrections for not more than 190
days, not more than the first 30 days of which must be used to
determine the defendant’s eligibility to participate in the program. In
determining the defendant’s eligibility to participate in the program,
the Director shall:
(1) Make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the
defendant in the program; and
-
*AB25*

– 10 –
(2) Consider the facts and circumstances of the defendant’s
offense based on the police report, the report of the presentence
investigation and any other information available to the Director.
(b) Shall, if appropriate, direct the Chief Parole and Probation
Officer to provide a copy of the defendant’s records to the Director

of the Director, if the defendant is determined to be ineligible for the
program.
(d) May require such reports concerning the defendant’s
participation in the program as it deems desirable.
3. If the defendant is ordered to complete the program before
sentencing, the Director of the Department of Corrections shall
return the defendant to the court not later than 150 days after the
defendant began the program. The Director shall certify either that
the defendant satisfactorily completed the program or that the
defendant did not, and shall report the results of the Director’s
evaluation, including any recommendations which will be helpful in
determining the proper sentence. Upon receiving the report, the
court shall sentence the defendant.
4. If the defendant is ordered to complete the program in lieu of
causing the sentence imposed to be executed upon the violation of a
condition of probation and the defendant satisfactorily completes the
program, the Director of the Department of Corrections shall, not
later than 150 days after the defendant began the program, return the
defendant to the court with certification that the defendant
satisfactorily completed the program. The court shall direct that:
(a) The defendant be placed under the supervision of the Chief
Parole and Probation Officer; and
(b) The Director of the Department of Corrections cause a copy

program to be provided to the Chief Parole and Probation Officer.
5. If a defendant is ordered to complete the program of
regimental discipline in lieu of causing the sentence imposed to be
executed upon the violation of a condition of probation, a failure by
the defendant satisfactorily to complete the program constitutes a
violation of that condition of probation and the Director of the
Department of Corrections shall return the defendant to the court.
6. Time spent in the program must be deducted from any
sentence which may thereafter be imposed.
