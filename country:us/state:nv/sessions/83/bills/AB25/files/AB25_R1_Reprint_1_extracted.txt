(ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 12, 2024

Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to offenders.
(BDR 16-296)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; revising requirements relating to the
provision of certain medical services to women in the
custody of the Department of Corrections; revising
provisions relating to notarial acts performed for persons
incarcerated in the state prison; eliminating the
requirement that the Director of the Department establish
and administer a program of regimental discipline; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who
2 is incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care
3 services, including an annual pelvic examination and mammography. (NRS
4 209.3817) Section 1 of this bill narrows the applicability of this requirement by
5 requiring the Department to provide a woman who is incarcerated access to an
6 annual pelvic examination and mammography only if: (1) the woman is over a
7 certain age; or (2) a provider of health care recommends that the woman receive
8 such services based solely on the personal or family medical history of the woman
9 or certain other risk factors.
10 Existing law contains the Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, which provides the
11 manner in which notarial acts must be performed, including that a notarial officer
12 determine, from personal knowledge or satisfactory evidence, that a person is the
13 person whose signature is on a document. (NRS 240.161-240.169, 240.1655)
14 Section 5 of this bill provides that a notarial officer has satisfactory evidence that a
15 person who is incarcerated in the state prison is the person whose signature is on a
16 document if the person is identified upon the basis of: (1) an inmate identification
17 card that is issued by the Department in accordance with regulations adopted by the
-
*AB25_R1*
– 2 –
18 Department and includes the name and a picture of the person; or (2) a declaration
19 signed by the person under penalty of perjury attesting to his or her identity.
20 Existing law: (1) requires the Director of the Department to establish and
21 administer a program of regimental discipline to be used as an alternative to
22 incarceration; and (2) authorizes a court to order certain defendants to undergo the
23 program as an alternative to incarceration. (NRS 176A.630, 176A.770, 176A.780,
24 209.356) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill repeal this requirement and authorization.
25 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes by removing references to a
26 provision repealed by section 6.

12 3. The court shall not modify a condition of probation or

18 176A.630 1. If the probationer is arrested, by or without

25 probationer has violated a condition of probation, the court shall, if
26 practicable, order the probationer to make restitution for any
27 necessary expenses incurred by a governmental entity in returning

32 (b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement

40 than the minimum term of imprisonment prescribed by the
41 applicable penal statute. If the Chief Parole and Probation Officer
42 recommends that the sentence of a probationer be modified and the
43 modified sentence be executed, the Chief Parole and Probation
44 Officer shall provide notice of the recommendation to any victim of
45 the crime for which the probationer was convicted who has
-
*AB25_R1*
– 5 –
1 requested in writing to be notified and who has provided a current
2 address to the Division. The notice must inform the victim that he or
3 she has the right to submit documents to the court and to be present
4 and heard at the hearing to determine whether the sentence of a
5 probationer who has violated a condition of probation should be
6 modified. The court shall not modify the sentence of a probationer
7 and cause the sentence to be executed until it has confirmed that the
8 Chief Parole and Probation Officer has complied with the provisions
9 of this paragraph. The Chief Parole and Probation Officer must not
10 be held responsible when such notification is not received by the
11 victim if the victim has not provided a current address. All personal
12 information, including, but not limited to, a current or former
13 address, which pertains to a victim and which is received by the
14 Division pursuant to this paragraph is confidential.
15 2. If the court finds that the probationer committed one or more
16 technical violations of the conditions of probation and the Division
17 has determined that the graduated sanctions adopted pursuant to
18 NRS 176A.510 have been exhausted, the court may:
19 (a) Continue the probation or suspension of sentence;
20 (b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement
21 pursuant to NRS 176A.660;

25 (2) Ninety days for the second temporary revocation; or
26 (3) One hundred and eighty days for the third temporary
27 revocation;
28 (d) Fully revoke the probation or suspension of sentence and
29 impose imprisonment for the remainder of the sentence for a fourth
30 or subsequent revocation; or
31 (e) Revoke the probation or suspension of sentence at the
32 request of the probationer. If the probation or suspension of sentence
33 is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the probationer must serve
34 such part of the unexpired maximum term or the maximum
35 aggregate term, as applicable, of his or her original sentence as may
36 be determined by the court.
37 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a probationer
38 who is arrested and detained for committing a technical violation of
39 the conditions of probation must be brought before the court not
40 later than 15 calendar days after the date of arrest and detention. If
41 the person is not brought before the court within 15 calendar days,
42 the probationer must be released from detention and returned to
43 probation status. Following a probationer’s release from detention,
44 the court may subsequently hold a hearing to determine if a
-
*AB25_R1*
– 6 –
1 technical violation has occurred. If the court finds that such a
2 technical violation occurred, the court may:
3 (a) Continue probation and modify the terms and conditions of
4 probation; or
5 (b) Fully or temporarily revoke probation in accordance with the
6 provisions of subsection 2.
7 4. A probationer who is arrested and detained for committing a
8 technical violation of the conditions of probation must receive credit
9 for any time served while the probationer is waiting for a hearing to
10 determine if a technical violation has occurred. The court must
11 apply such credit to any term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
12 subsection 2.
13 5. Any time served by a probationer while waiting for a
14 hearing, as set forth in subsection 4, and any time served in
15 accordance with any term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
16 subsection 2 must be applied toward the original sentence of the
17 probationer.

20 revocation of probation:
21 (a) Consuming any alcoholic beverage.

Raw Text:
(Reprinted with amendments adopted on April 14, 2025)
FIRST REPRINT A.B. 25
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 25–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
(ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 12, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to offenders.
(BDR 16-296)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; revising requirements relating to the
provision of certain medical services to women in the
custody of the Department of Corrections; revising
provisions relating to notarial acts performed for persons
incarcerated in the state prison; eliminating the
requirement that the Director of the Department establish
and administer a program of regimental discipline; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who
2 is incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care
3 services, including an annual pelvic examination and mammography. (NRS
4 209.3817) Section 1 of this bill narrows the applicability of this requirement by
5 requiring the Department to provide a woman who is incarcerated access to an
6 annual pelvic examination and mammography only if: (1) the woman is over a
7 certain age; or (2) a provider of health care recommends that the woman receive
8 such services based solely on the personal or family medical history of the woman
9 or certain other risk factors.
10 Existing law contains the Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, which provides the
11 manner in which notarial acts must be performed, including that a notarial officer
12 determine, from personal knowledge or satisfactory evidence, that a person is the
13 person whose signature is on a document. (NRS 240.161-240.169, 240.1655)
14 Section 5 of this bill provides that a notarial officer has satisfactory evidence that a
15 person who is incarcerated in the state prison is the person whose signature is on a
16 document if the person is identified upon the basis of: (1) an inmate identification
17 card that is issued by the Department in accordance with regulations adopted by the
-
*AB25_R1*

– 2 –
18 Department and includes the name and a picture of the person; or (2) a declaration
19 signed by the person under penalty of perjury attesting to his or her identity.
20 Existing law: (1) requires the Director of the Department to establish and
21 administer a program of regimental discipline to be used as an alternative to
22 incarceration; and (2) authorizes a court to order certain defendants to undergo the
23 program as an alternative to incarceration. (NRS 176A.630, 176A.770, 176A.780,
24 209.356) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill repeal this requirement and authorization.
25 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes by removing references to a
26 provision repealed by section 6.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

-
*AB25_R1*

– 4 –
1 order must also be sent to the Director of the Department of
2 Corrections if the probationer is under the supervision of the
3 Director pursuant to NRS 176A.780.]
4 2. If the probationer is participating in a program of probation
5 secured by a surety bond, the court shall not impose or modify the
6 conditions of probation unless the court notifies the surety and:
7 (a) Causes the original bond to be revoked and requires a new
8 bond to which the original and the new conditions are appended and
9 made part; or
10 (b) Requires an additional bond to which the new conditions are
11 appended and made part.
12 3. The court shall not modify a condition of probation or
13 suspension of sentence that was imposed pursuant to NRS
14 176A.410, unless the court finds that extraordinary circumstances
15 are present and the court enters those extraordinary circumstances in
16 the record.
17 Sec. 4. NRS 176A.630 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 176A.630 1. If the probationer is arrested, by or without
19 warrant, in another judicial district of this state, the court which
20 granted the probation may assign the case to the district court of that
21 district, with the consent of that court. The court retaining or thus
22 acquiring jurisdiction shall cause the defendant to be brought before
23 it and consider the system of graduated sanctions adopted pursuant
24 to NRS 176A.510, if applicable. Upon determining that the
25 probationer has violated a condition of probation, the court shall, if
26 practicable, order the probationer to make restitution for any
27 necessary expenses incurred by a governmental entity in returning
28 the probationer to the court for violation of the probation. If the
29 court finds that the probationer committed a violation of a condition
30 of probation that is not a technical violation, the court may:
31 (a) Continue or revoke the probation or suspension of sentence;
32 (b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement

38 term of imprisonment and cause the modified sentence to be
39 executed. The court shall not make the term of imprisonment less
40 than the minimum term of imprisonment prescribed by the
41 applicable penal statute. If the Chief Parole and Probation Officer
42 recommends that the sentence of a probationer be modified and the
43 modified sentence be executed, the Chief Parole and Probation
44 Officer shall provide notice of the recommendation to any victim of
45 the crime for which the probationer was convicted who has
-
*AB25_R1*

– 5 –
1 requested in writing to be notified and who has provided a current
2 address to the Division. The notice must inform the victim that he or
3 she has the right to submit documents to the court and to be present
4 and heard at the hearing to determine whether the sentence of a
5 probationer who has violated a condition of probation should be
6 modified. The court shall not modify the sentence of a probationer
7 and cause the sentence to be executed until it has confirmed that the
8 Chief Parole and Probation Officer has complied with the provisions
9 of this paragraph. The Chief Parole and Probation Officer must not
10 be held responsible when such notification is not received by the
11 victim if the victim has not provided a current address. All personal
12 information, including, but not limited to, a current or former
13 address, which pertains to a victim and which is received by the
14 Division pursuant to this paragraph is confidential.
15 2. If the court finds that the probationer committed one or more
16 technical violations of the conditions of probation and the Division
17 has determined that the graduated sanctions adopted pursuant to
18 NRS 176A.510 have been exhausted, the court may:
19 (a) Continue the probation or suspension of sentence;
20 (b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement
21 pursuant to NRS 176A.660;
22 (c) Temporarily revoke the probation or suspension of sentence
23 and impose a term of imprisonment of not more than:
24 (1) Thirty days for the first temporary revocation;
25 (2) Ninety days for the second temporary revocation; or
26 (3) One hundred and eighty days for the third temporary
27 revocation;
28 (d) Fully revoke the probation or suspension of sentence and
29 impose imprisonment for the remainder of the sentence for a fourth
30 or subsequent revocation; or
31 (e) Revoke the probation or suspension of sentence at the
32 request of the probationer. If the probation or suspension of sentence
33 is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the probationer must serve
34 such part of the unexpired maximum term or the maximum
35 aggregate term, as applicable, of his or her original sentence as may
36 be determined by the court.
37 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a probationer
38 who is arrested and detained for committing a technical violation of
39 the conditions of probation must be brought before the court not
40 later than 15 calendar days after the date of arrest and detention. If
41 the person is not brought before the court within 15 calendar days,
42 the probationer must be released from detention and returned to
43 probation status. Following a probationer’s release from detention,
44 the court may subsequently hold a hearing to determine if a
-
*AB25_R1*

– 6 –
1 technical violation has occurred. If the court finds that such a
2 technical violation occurred, the court may:
3 (a) Continue probation and modify the terms and conditions of
4 probation; or
5 (b) Fully or temporarily revoke probation in accordance with the
6 provisions of subsection 2.
7 4. A probationer who is arrested and detained for committing a
8 technical violation of the conditions of probation must receive credit
9 for any time served while the probationer is waiting for a hearing to
10 determine if a technical violation has occurred. The court must
11 apply such credit to any term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
12 subsection 2.
13 5. Any time served by a probationer while waiting for a
14 hearing, as set forth in subsection 4, and any time served in
15 accordance with any term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
16 subsection 2 must be applied toward the original sentence of the
17 probationer.

19 probationer must not, by itself, be used as the only basis for the
20 revocation of probation:
21 (a) Consuming any alcoholic beverage.

evaluation, including any recommendations which will be helpful in
determining the proper sentence. Upon receiving the report, the
court shall sentence the defendant.
4. If the defendant is ordered to complete the program in lieu of
causing the sentence imposed to be executed upon the violation of a
condition of probation and the defendant satisfactorily completes the
program, the Director of the Department of Corrections shall, not
later than 150 days after the defendant began the program, return the
defendant to the court with certification that the defendant
satisfactorily completed the program. The court shall direct that:
(a) The defendant be placed under the supervision of the Chief
Parole and Probation Officer; and
(b) The Director of the Department of Corrections cause a copy
of the records concerning the defendant’s participation in the
program to be provided to the Chief Parole and Probation Officer.
5. If a defendant is ordered to complete the program of
regimental discipline in lieu of causing the sentence imposed to be
executed upon the violation of a condition of probation, a failure by
the defendant satisfactorily to complete the program constitutes a
violation of that condition of probation and the Director of the
Department of Corrections shall return the defendant to the court.
6. Time spent in the program must be deducted from any
sentence which may thereafter be imposed.
