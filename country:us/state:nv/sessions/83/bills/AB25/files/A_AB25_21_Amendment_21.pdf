AN ACT relating to offenders; revising requirements relating to the provision of
certain medical services to women in the custody of the Department of
Corrections; revising provisions relating to notarial acts performed for
persons incarcerated in the state prison; eliminating the requirement
that the Director of the Department establish and administer a program
of regimental discipline; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who is
2 incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care services [. (NRS
3 209.3817) Section 1 of this bill requires that any such access be provided in accordance with
4 community standards of care and national guidelines for the provision of such services.
5 Section 1 also removes specific language requiring this access to include] , including an
6 annual pelvic examination and mammography . [, thereby requiring] (NRS 209.3817) Section
7 1 of this bill narrows the applicability of this requirement by requiring the Department to
8 provide a woman who is incarcerated access to [a] an annual pelvic examination and
9 mammography [in accordance with community standards of care and national guidelines for
10 the provision of pelvic examinations and mammography, rather than on an annual basis.] only
11 if: (1) the woman is over a certain age; or (2) a provider of health care recommends that
12 the woman receive such services based solely on the personal or family medical history
13 of the woman or certain other risk factors.
14 Existing law contains the Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, which provides the manner in
15 which notarial acts must be performed, including that a notarial officer determine, from
16 personal knowledge or satisfactory evidence, that a person is the person whose signature is on
17 a document. (NRS 240.161-240.169, 240.1655) Section 5 of this bill provides that a notarial
18 officer has satisfactory evidence that a person who is incarcerated in the state prison is the
19 person whose signature is on a document if the person is identified upon the basis of: (1) an
20 inmate identification card that is issued by the Department in accordance with regulations
21 adopted by the Department and includes the name and a picture of the person; or (2) a
22 declaration signed by the person under penalty of perjury attesting to his or her identity.
23 Existing law: (1) requires the Director of the Department to establish and administer a
24 program of regimental discipline to be used as an alternative to incarceration; and (2)
25 authorizes a court to order certain defendants to undergo the program as an alternative to

Assembly Amendment No. 21 to Assembly Bill No. 25 Page 4
26 incarceration. (NRS 176A.630, 176A.770, 176A.780, 209.356) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill
27 repeal this requirement and authorization. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming
28 changes by removing references to a provision repealed by section 6.

14 current address to the Division. The notice must inform the victim that he or she has
15 the right to submit documents to the court and to be present and heard at the hearing
16 to determine whether the sentence of a probationer who has violated a condition of
17 probation should be modified. The court shall not modify the sentence of a
18 probationer and cause the sentence to be executed until it has confirmed that the
19 Chief Parole and Probation Officer has complied with the provisions of this
20 paragraph. The Chief Parole and Probation Officer must not be held responsible
21 when such notification is not received by the victim if the victim has not provided a
22 current address. All personal information, including, but not limited to, a current or
23 former address, which pertains to a victim and which is received by the Division
24 pursuant to this paragraph is confidential.
25 2. If the court finds that the probationer committed one or more technical
26 violations of the conditions of probation and the Division has determined that the
27 graduated sanctions adopted pursuant to NRS 176A.510 have been exhausted, the
28 court may:
29 (a) Continue the probation or suspension of sentence;
30 (b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement pursuant to NRS

39 revocation; or

42 paragraph, the probationer must serve such part of the unexpired maximum term or
43 the maximum aggregate term, as applicable, of his or her original sentence as may
44 be determined by the court.
45 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a probationer who is arrested
46 and detained for committing a technical violation of the conditions of probation
47 must be brought before the court not later than 15 calendar days after the date of
48 arrest and detention. If the person is not brought before the court within 15 calendar
49 days, the probationer must be released from detention and returned to probation

176A.770 Legislative declaration. The Legislature hereby determines and
declares that a program of regimental discipline is not to be used as an alternative to

176A.780 Eligibility; procedure; completion; deduction of time from
sentence.
1. If a defendant:
(a) Is male;
(b) Has been convicted of a felony that:

2. If the court orders the defendant to undergo a program of regimental
discipline, it:
(a) Shall place the defendant under the supervision of the Director of the
