Assembly Bill No. 25–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to offenders; revising requirements relating to the
provision of certain medical services to women in the
custody of the Department of Corrections; revising
provisions relating to notarial acts performed for persons
incarcerated in the state prison; eliminating the requirement
that the Director of the Department establish and administer a
program of regimental discipline; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who
is incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care
services, including an annual pelvic examination and mammography. (NRS
209.3817) Section 1 of this bill narrows the applicability of this requirement by
requiring the Department to provide a woman who is incarcerated access to an
annual pelvic examination and mammography only if: (1) the woman is over a
certain age; or (2) a provider of health care recommends that the woman receive
such services based solely on the personal or family medical history of the woman
or certain other risk factors.
Existing law contains the Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, which provides the
manner in which notarial acts must be performed, including that a notarial officer
determine, from personal knowledge or satisfactory evidence, that a person is the
person whose signature is on a document. (NRS 240.161-240.169, 240.1655)
Section 5 of this bill provides that a notarial officer has satisfactory evidence that a
person who is incarcerated in the state prison is the person whose signature is on a
document if the person is identified upon the basis of: (1) an inmate identification
card that is issued by the Department in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Department and includes the name and a picture of the person; or (2) a declaration
signed by the person under penalty of perjury attesting to his or her identity.
Existing law: (1) requires the Director of the Department to establish and
administer a program of regimental discipline to be used as an alternative to
incarceration; and (2) authorizes a court to order certain defendants to undergo the
program as an alternative to incarceration. (NRS 176A.630, 176A.770, 176A.780,
209.356) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill repeal this requirement and authorization.
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes by removing references to a
provision repealed by section 6.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

3. The court shall not modify a condition of probation or
suspension of sentence that was imposed pursuant to NRS
176A.410, unless the court finds that extraordinary circumstances
are present and the court enters those extraordinary circumstances in
the record.
Sec. 4. NRS 176A.630 is hereby amended to read as follows:
176A.630 1. If the probationer is arrested, by or without
warrant, in another judicial district of this state, the court which
granted the probation may assign the case to the district court of that
district, with the consent of that court. The court retaining or thus
acquiring jurisdiction shall cause the defendant to be brought before
it and consider the system of graduated sanctions adopted pursuant
to NRS 176A.510, if applicable. Upon determining that the
probationer has violated a condition of probation, the court shall, if
practicable, order the probationer to make restitution for any
necessary expenses incurred by a governmental entity in returning
the probationer to the court for violation of the probation. If the
court finds that the probationer committed a violation of a condition
of probation that is not a technical violation, the court may:
(a) Continue or revoke the probation or suspension of sentence;
(b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement
pursuant to NRS 176A.660;

executed. The court shall not make the term of imprisonment less

applicable penal statute. If the Chief Parole and Probation Officer
recommends that the sentence of a probationer be modified and the
modified sentence be executed, the Chief Parole and Probation
Officer shall provide notice of the recommendation to any victim of
the crime for which the probationer was convicted who has
requested in writing to be notified and who has provided a current
address to the Division. The notice must inform the victim that he or
she has the right to submit documents to the court and to be present
and heard at the hearing to determine whether the sentence of a
probationer who has violated a condition of probation should be
modified. The court shall not modify the sentence of a probationer
and cause the sentence to be executed until it has confirmed that the
Chief Parole and Probation Officer has complied with the provisions
of this paragraph. The Chief Parole and Probation Officer must not
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
be held responsible when such notification is not received by the
victim if the victim has not provided a current address. All personal
information, including, but not limited to, a current or former
address, which pertains to a victim and which is received by the
Division pursuant to this paragraph is confidential.
2. If the court finds that the probationer committed one or more
technical violations of the conditions of probation and the Division
has determined that the graduated sanctions adopted pursuant to
NRS 176A.510 have been exhausted, the court may:
(a) Continue the probation or suspension of sentence;
(b) Order the probationer to a term of residential confinement
pursuant to NRS 176A.660;
(c) Temporarily revoke the probation or suspension of sentence
and impose a term of imprisonment of not more than:
(1) Thirty days for the first temporary revocation;
(2) Ninety days for the second temporary revocation; or
(3) One hundred and eighty days for the third temporary
revocation;
(d) Fully revoke the probation or suspension of sentence and
impose imprisonment for the remainder of the sentence for a fourth
or subsequent revocation; or
(e) Revoke the probation or suspension of sentence at the
request of the probationer. If the probation or suspension of sentence
is revoked pursuant to this paragraph, the probationer must serve
such part of the unexpired maximum term or the maximum
aggregate term, as applicable, of his or her original sentence as may
be determined by the court.
3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a probationer
who is arrested and detained for committing a technical violation of
the conditions of probation must be brought before the court not
later than 15 calendar days after the date of arrest and detention. If
the person is not brought before the court within 15 calendar days,
the probationer must be released from detention and returned to
probation status. Following a probationer’s release from detention,
the court may subsequently hold a hearing to determine if a
technical violation has occurred. If the court finds that such a
technical violation occurred, the court may:
(a) Continue probation and modify the terms and conditions of
probation; or
(b) Fully or temporarily revoke probation in accordance with the
provisions of subsection 2.
4. A probationer who is arrested and detained for committing a
technical violation of the conditions of probation must receive credit

for any time served while the probationer is waiting for a hearing to
determine if a technical violation has occurred. The court must
apply such credit to any term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
subsection 2.
5. Any time served by a probationer while waiting for a
hearing, as set forth in subsection 4, and any time served in
accordance with any term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to
subsection 2 must be applied toward the original sentence of the
probationer.
6. The commission of one of the following acts by a
probationer must not, by itself, be used as the only basis for the
revocation of probation:

(c) Failing to abide by the requirements of a mental health or
substance use treatment program.
