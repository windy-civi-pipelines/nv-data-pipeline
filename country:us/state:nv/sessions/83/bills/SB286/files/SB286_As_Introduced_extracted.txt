AN ACT relating to planning; declaring the importance of tribal
knowledge and expertise and consulting tribal
governments when engaged in the land use planning
process; revising provisions relating to the State and
Local Government Cooperation Act to include tribal
governments; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public
2 interest to place the primary authority for the planning process with the local
3 governments and that state participation in land use planning should be limited to
4 certain activities. (NRS 321.640) Section 1 of this bill declares the importance of
5 tribal knowledge and expertise as a source of local knowledge and consulting with
6 tribal governments and tribal members when local governments are engaged in the
7 planning process.
8 Existing law sets forth the State and Local Government Cooperation Act for the
9 purpose of encouraging communication, cooperation and coordinated working
10 relationships between state agencies and local governments. To carry out this
11 purpose, existing law provides that state agencies and local governments should, to
12 the extent practicable, follow certain procedures when adopting or amending
13 certain plans. (NRS 277.182-277.188) Section 5 of this bill provides that state
-

– 2 –
14 agencies and local governments should also communicate, cooperate and
15 coordinate working relationships with tribal governments by following the same
16 procedures to inform and solicit and consider comments from tribal governments
17 when adopting or amending certain plans.
18 Consistent with this change, section 3 of this bill renames the title of the State
19 and Local Government Cooperation Act to the State, Local and Tribal Government
20 Cooperation Act. Section 6 of this bill provides that these provisions do not limit
21 the power of a state agency or local government to carry out its statutory duties and
22 responsibilities.
23 Section 2 of this bill defines “tribal government” for the purposes of the State,
24 Local and Tribal Government Cooperation Act. Section 4 of this bill applies the
25 definitions in existing law relating to the Act and section 2 to the provisions of the
26 Act.
