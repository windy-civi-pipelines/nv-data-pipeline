AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain insurers to allow
certain persons who are less than 65 years of age to
purchase a Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer
makes available for purchase to new insureds who are 65
years of age or older; imposing certain restrictions on the
limitations, terms and conditions such an insurer may
impose and the premiums such an insurer may charge for
such policies to persons who are less than 65 years of age;
requiring such an insurer to establish certain open
enrollment periods for the purchase of a Medicare
supplemental policy; prohibiting an insurer from
imposing an exclusion of certain benefits with respect to a
Medicare supplemental policy issued during an open

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
2 insurance program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with
3 disabilities or end-stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C.
4 §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental
5 policy” to mean a policy offered by a private insurer that is primarily designed to
6 pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare because of certain limitations under
7 Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a Medicare supplemental
8 policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private insurer to sell or
9 issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of age

10 and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42
11 U.S.C. § 1395ss)
12 Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental
13 policy in this State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local
14 government employees, to allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and
15 enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease to
16 purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer offers to new insureds
17 in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4 imposes certain limitations
18 on the premium rate that such an insurer may charge such persons for a Medicare
19 supplemental policy and prohibits insurers from imposing additional limitations,
20 terms or conditions on such persons with respect to the policy that the insurer
21 would not impose on persons who are 65 years of age or older.
22 Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to
23 annually offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a
24 Medicare supplemental policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking
25 certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for,
26 a policy offered to a person during the open enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352)
27 Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open enrollment period which
28 allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare
29 supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
30 first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare,
31 which provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside
32 of a hospital. During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer
33 from taking certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of a policy
34 offered to the person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from imposing an
35 exclusion of benefits under a Medicare supplemental policy during that open
36 enrollment period based on a preexisting condition. Section 6 of this bill adds a
37 similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment period established under
38 existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of age or older and
39 persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability or end-
40 stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a similar
41 open enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains open
42 through April 1, 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2)
43 suffering from a disability or end-stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage
44 under Part B of Medicare as of October 1, 2025, on the basis of the disability or
45 end-stage renal disease.
46 Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital
47 or medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer
48 insurance to employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare
49 supplemental policy” to have the same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal
50 regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition.
51 Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to remove duplicative
52 language from other existing provisions.

21 State that includes the same or lesser benefits. Innovative benefits,
