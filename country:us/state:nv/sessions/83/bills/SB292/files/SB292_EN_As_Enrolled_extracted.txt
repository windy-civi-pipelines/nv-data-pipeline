Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain insurers to allow
certain persons who are less than 65 years of age to purchase
a Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer makes
available for purchase to new insureds who are 65 years of
age or older; imposing certain restrictions on the limitations,
terms and conditions such an insurer may impose and the
premiums such an insurer may charge for such policies to
persons who are less than 65 years of age; requiring such an
insurer to establish certain open enrollment periods for the
purchase of a Medicare supplemental policy; prohibiting an
insurer from imposing an exclusion of certain benefits with
respect to a Medicare supplemental policy issued during an
open enrollment period; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
insurance program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with
disabilities or end-stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C.

Section 2:
§§ 1395 et seq.) Existing federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental
policy” to mean a policy offered by a private insurer that is primarily designed to
pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare because of certain limitations under
Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a Medicare supplemental
policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private insurer to sell or
issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of age
and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42
U.S.C. § 1395ss)

Section 3:
Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental
policy in this State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local
government employees, to allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and
enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease to
purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer offers to new insureds
in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4 imposes certain limitations
on the premium rate that such an insurer may charge such persons for a Medicare
supplemental policy and prohibits insurers from imposing additional limitations,
terms or conditions on such persons with respect to the policy that the insurer
would not impose on persons who are 65 years of age or older.
Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to
annually offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a
Medicare supplemental policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking
certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for,
a policy offered to a person during the open enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352)

Section 4:
Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open enrollment period which
allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare
supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare,
which provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
of a hospital. During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer
from taking certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of a policy
offered to the person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from imposing an
exclusion of benefits under a Medicare supplemental policy during that open
enrollment period based on a preexisting condition. Section 6 of this bill adds a
similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment period established under
existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of age or older and
persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability or end-
stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a similar
open enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains open
through April 1, 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2)
suffering from a disability or end-stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage
under Part B of Medicare as of October 1, 2025, on the basis of the disability or
end-stage renal disease.

Section 5:
Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital
or medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer
insurance to employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare
supplemental policy” to have the same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal
regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition.

Section 6:
Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to remove duplicative
language from other existing provisions.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 292–Senator Lange
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain insurers to allow
certain persons who are less than 65 years of age to purchase
a Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer makes
available for purchase to new insureds who are 65 years of
age or older; imposing certain restrictions on the limitations,
terms and conditions such an insurer may impose and the
premiums such an insurer may charge for such policies to
persons who are less than 65 years of age; requiring such an
insurer to establish certain open enrollment periods for the
purchase of a Medicare supplemental policy; prohibiting an
insurer from imposing an exclusion of certain benefits with
respect to a Medicare supplemental policy issued during an
open enrollment period; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
insurance program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with
disabilities or end-stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C.
§§ 1395 et seq.) Existing federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental
policy” to mean a policy offered by a private insurer that is primarily designed to
pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare because of certain limitations under
Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a Medicare supplemental
policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private insurer to sell or
issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of age
and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42
U.S.C. § 1395ss)
Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental
policy in this State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local
government employees, to allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and
enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease to
purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer offers to new insureds
in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4 imposes certain limitations
on the premium rate that such an insurer may charge such persons for a Medicare
supplemental policy and prohibits insurers from imposing additional limitations,
terms or conditions on such persons with respect to the policy that the insurer
would not impose on persons who are 65 years of age or older.
Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to
annually offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a
Medicare supplemental policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking
certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for,
a policy offered to a person during the open enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352)
Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open enrollment period which
allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare
supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare,
which provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside
-
83rd Session (2025)

of a hospital. During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer
from taking certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of a policy
offered to the person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from imposing an
exclusion of benefits under a Medicare supplemental policy during that open
enrollment period based on a preexisting condition. Section 6 of this bill adds a
similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment period established under
existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of age or older and
persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability or end-
stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a similar
open enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains open
through April 1, 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2)
suffering from a disability or end-stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage
under Part B of Medicare as of October 1, 2025, on the basis of the disability or
end-stage renal disease.
Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital
or medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer
insurance to employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare
supplemental policy” to have the same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal
regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition.
Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to remove duplicative
language from other existing provisions.
