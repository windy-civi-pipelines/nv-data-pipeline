(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain insurers to allow
certain persons who are less than 65 years of age to
purchase a Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer
makes available for purchase to new insureds who are 65
years of age or older; imposing certain restrictions on the
limitations, terms and conditions such an insurer may
impose and the premiums such an insurer may charge for
such policies to persons who are less than 65 years of age;
requiring such an insurer to establish certain open
enrollment periods for the purchase of a Medicare
supplemental policy; prohibiting an insurer from
imposing an exclusion of certain benefits with respect to a
Medicare supplemental policy issued during an open
enrollment period; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
2 insurance program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with
3 disabilities or end-stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C.
4 §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental
5 policy” to mean a policy offered by a private insurer that is primarily designed to
6 pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare because of certain limitations under
7 Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a Medicare supplemental
8 policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private insurer to sell or
9 issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of age
-

– 2 –
10 and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42
11 U.S.C. § 1395ss)
12 Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental
13 policy in this State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local
14 government employees, to allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and
15 enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease to
16 purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer offers to new insureds
17 in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4 requires such an insurer to
18 offer a Medicare supplemental policy to such persons at the same premium rate as
19 is charged when the Medicare supplemental policy is offered to a person who is 65
20 years of age without additional limitations, terms or conditions.
21 Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to
22 annually offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a
23 Medicare supplemental policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking
24 certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for,
25 a policy offered to a person during the open enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352)
26 Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open enrollment period which
27 allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare
28 supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
29 first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare,
30 which provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside
31 of a hospital. During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer
32 from taking certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price
33 charged for, a policy offered to the person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from
34 imposing an exclusion of benefits under a Medicare supplemental policy during
35 that open enrollment period based on a preexisting condition. Section 6 of this bill
36 adds a similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment period established
37 under existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of age or
38 older and persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability
39 or end-stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a
40 similar open enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains
41 open through April 1, 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2)
42 suffering from a disability or end-stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage
43 under Part B of Medicare as of October 1, 2025, on the basis of the disability or
44 end-stage renal disease.
45 Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital
46 or medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer
47 insurance to employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare
48 supplemental policy” to have the same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal
49 regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition.
50 Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to remove duplicative
51 language from other existing provisions.

7 Medicare supplemental policy made available by the insurer in this
8 State that includes the same or lesser benefits. Innovative benefits,
9 as described in 42 U.S.C. § 1395ss(p)(4)(B), must not be considered

31 under which the person is currently insured or adjustment to the
32 premiums charged for that policy.
33 4. An insurer or other person or entity shall not vary the
34 commission associated with the purchase of Medicare supplemental

38 enrollment period or otherwise treat Medicare supplemental policies
39 purchased during that open enrollment period differently for the
40 purposes of commission for any reason, including, without
41 limitation:
42 (a) Because the Medicare supplemental policy was purchased
43 during the open enrollment period offered pursuant to subsection 1;
-
*SB292*

1 (b) Because the Medicare supplemental policy is classified as
2 guaranteed issue under 42 U.S.C. § 1395ss or any other applicable

1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
2 insurance program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with
3 disabilities or end-stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C.
4 §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental
5 policy” to mean a policy offered by a private insurer that is primarily designed to
6 pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare because of certain limitations under
7 Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a Medicare supplemental
8 policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private insurer to sell or
9 issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of age

10 and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42
11 U.S.C. § 1395ss)
12 Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental
13 policy in this State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local
14 government employees, to allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and
15 enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease to
16 purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the insurer offers to new insureds
17 in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4 requires such an insurer to
18 offer a Medicare supplemental policy to such persons at the same premium rate as
19 is charged when the Medicare supplemental policy is offered to a person who is 65
20 years of age without additional limitations, terms or conditions.
21 Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to
22 annually offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a
23 Medicare supplemental policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking
24 certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for,
25 a policy offered to a person during the open enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352)
26 Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open enrollment period which
27 allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare
28 supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
29 first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare,
30 which provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside
31 of a hospital. During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer
32 from taking certain actions with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of, or price
33 charged for, a policy offered to the person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from
34 imposing an exclusion of benefits under a Medicare supplemental policy during
35 that open enrollment period based on a preexisting condition. Section 6 of this bill
36 adds a similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment period established
37 under existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of age or
38 older and persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability
39 or end-stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a
40 similar open enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains
41 open through April 1, 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2)
42 suffering from a disability or end-stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage
43 under Part B of Medicare as of October 1, 2025, on the basis of the disability or
44 end-stage renal disease.
45 Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital
46 or medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer
47 insurance to employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare
48 supplemental policy” to have the same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal
49 regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition.
50 Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to remove duplicative
51 language from other existing provisions.

5 day of the birthday month of the person and remaining open for at
6 least 60 days thereafter, during which the person may purchase any
7 Medicare supplemental policy made available by the insurer in this
8 State that includes the same or lesser benefits. Innovative benefits,
9 as described in 42 U.S.C. § 1395ss(p)(4)(B), must not be considered
10 when determining whether a Medicare supplemental policy includes
11 the same benefits as or lesser benefits than another such policy.
12 2. During the open enrollment period offered pursuant to
13 subsection 1, an insurer shall not [deny] :
14 (a) Deny or condition the issuance or effectiveness, or
15 discriminate in the price of coverage, of a Medicare supplemental

19 (b) Impose an exclusion of benefits provided under the
20 Medicare supplemental policy based on a preexisting medical
21 condition of a person described in subsection 1.
22 3. At least 30 days before the beginning of the open enrollment

31 under which the person is currently insured or adjustment to the
32 premiums charged for that policy.
33 4. An insurer or other person or entity shall not vary the
34 commission associated with the purchase of Medicare supplemental
35 policies during the open enrollment period offered pursuant to
36 subsection 1, pay differential commissions associated with the

38 enrollment period or otherwise treat Medicare supplemental policies
39 purchased during that open enrollment period differently for the
40 purposes of commission for any reason, including, without
41 limitation:
42 (a) Because the Medicare supplemental policy was purchased
43 during the open enrollment period offered pursuant to subsection 1;
-
*SB292*

1 (b) Because the Medicare supplemental policy is classified as
2 guaranteed issue under 42 U.S.C. § 1395ss or any other applicable
3 federal or state law or regulations; or
4 (c) Because of the health status, claims experience, receipt of
5 health care or medical condition of the insured.
6 5. An insurer or other person or entity must treat the purchase
7 of a Medicare supplemental policy during the open enrollment
8 period offered pursuant to subsection 1 in the same manner as the
