AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain insurers to allow certain persons
who are less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare supplemental
policy that the insurer makes available for purchase to new insureds
who are 65 years of age or older; imposing certain restrictions on the
limitations, terms and conditions such an insurer may impose and the
premiums such an insurer may charge for such policies to persons who
are less than 65 years of age; requiring such an insurer to establish
certain open enrollment periods for the purchase of a Medicare
supplemental policy; prohibiting an insurer from imposing an
exclusion of certain benefits with respect to a Medicare supplemental
policy issued during an open enrollment period; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health insurance
2 program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with disabilities or end-
3 stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing
4 federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental policy” to mean a policy offered by a
5 private insurer that is primarily designed to pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare
6 because of certain limitations under Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a
7 Medicare supplemental policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private
8 insurer to sell or issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of
9 age and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42 U.S.C.
10 § 1395ss)
11 Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental policy in this
12 State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local government employees, to
13 allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a
14 disability or end-stage renal disease to purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the
15 insurer offers to new insureds in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4
16 [requires] imposes certain limitations on the premium rate that such an insurer [to offer]
17 may charge such persons for a Medicare supplemental policy [to such persons at the same
Assembly Amendment No. 703 to Senate Bill No. 292 Page 4
18 premium rate as is charged when the Medicare supplemental policy is offered to a person who
19 is 65 years of age without] and prohibits insurers from imposing additional limitations,
20 terms or conditions [.] on such persons with respect to the policy that the insurer would
21 not impose on persons who are 65 years of age or older.
22 Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to annually
23 offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a Medicare supplemental
24 policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking certain actions with respect to the
25 issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for, a policy offered to a person during the open
26 enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352) Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open
27 enrollment period which allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase
28 a Medicare supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
29 first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare, which
30 provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside of a hospital.
31 During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer from taking certain actions
32 with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of [, or price charged for,] a policy offered to the
33 person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from imposing an exclusion of benefits under a
34 Medicare supplemental policy during that open enrollment period based on a preexisting
35 condition. Section 6 of this bill adds a similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment
36 period established under existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of
37 age or older and persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability or
38 end-stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a similar open
39 enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains open through April 1,
40 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2) suffering from a disability or end-
41 stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare as of October 1,
42 2025, on the basis of the disability or end-stage renal disease.
43 Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital or
44 medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer insurance to
45 employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare supplemental policy” to have the
46 same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes
47 the applicability of that definition. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to
48 remove duplicative language from other existing provisions.

36 687B.015 [As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,
37 “binder”] “Binder” means an oral or written contract for temporary insurance
38 which is used when a policy is not immediately issued to evidence that the coverage

42 687B.352 1. An insurer that issues a Medicare supplemental policy shall
43 offer to a person currently insured under any such policy an annual open enrollment

45 remaining open for at least 60 days thereafter, during which the person may
46 purchase any Medicare supplemental policy made available by the insurer in this
47 State that includes the same or lesser benefits. Innovative benefits, as described in

52 insurer shall not [deny] :

AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain insurers to allow certain persons
who are less than 65 years of age to purchase a Medicare supplemental
policy that the insurer makes available for purchase to new insureds
who are 65 years of age or older; imposing certain restrictions on the
limitations, terms and conditions such an insurer may impose and the
premiums such an insurer may charge for such policies to persons who
are less than 65 years of age; requiring such an insurer to establish
certain open enrollment periods for the purchase of a Medicare
supplemental policy; prohibiting an insurer from imposing an
exclusion of certain benefits with respect to a Medicare supplemental
policy issued during an open enrollment period; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health insurance
2 program for persons 65 years of age or older and specified persons with disabilities or end-
3 stage renal disease who are less than 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing
4 federal law defines the term “Medicare supplemental policy” to mean a policy offered by a
5 private insurer that is primarily designed to pay expenses not reimbursed under Medicare
6 because of certain limitations under Medicare. Existing federal law requires the issuance of a
7 Medicare supplemental policy under certain circumstances but does not require a private
8 insurer to sell or issue a Medicare supplemental policy to a person who is less than 65 years of
9 age and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a disability or end-stage renal disease. (42 U.S.C.
10 § 1395ss)
11 Section 4 of this bill requires an insurer that offers a Medicare supplemental policy in this
12 State, including an insurer that provides coverage to state and local government employees, to
13 allow a person who is less than 65 years of age and enrolled in Medicare on the basis of a
14 disability or end-stage renal disease to purchase any Medicare supplemental policy that the
15 insurer offers to new insureds in this State who are 65 years of age or older. Section 4
16 [requires] imposes certain limitations on the premium rate that such an insurer [to offer]
17 may charge such persons for a Medicare supplemental policy [to such persons at the same

Assembly Amendment No. 703 to Senate Bill No. 292 Page 4
18 premium rate as is charged when the Medicare supplemental policy is offered to a person who
19 is 65 years of age without] and prohibits insurers from imposing additional limitations,
20 terms or conditions [.] on such persons with respect to the policy that the insurer would
21 not impose on persons who are 65 years of age or older.
22 Existing law requires an insurer offering a Medicare supplemental policy to annually
23 offer an open enrollment period for persons currently covered by a Medicare supplemental
24 policy, during which the insurer is prohibited from taking certain actions with respect to the
25 issuance or effectiveness of, or price charged for, a policy offered to a person during the open
26 enrollment period. (NRS 687B.352) Section 4 requires an insurer to establish a similar open
27 enrollment period which allows an eligible person who is less than 65 years of age to purchase
28 a Medicare supplemental policy during a 6-month period commencing on the first day of the
29 first month during which the person enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare, which
30 provides coverage for certain medically necessary services provided outside of a hospital.
31 During that open enrollment period, section 4 prohibits an insurer from taking certain actions
32 with respect to the issuance or effectiveness of [, or price charged for,] a policy offered to the
33 person. Section 4 also prohibits an insurer from imposing an exclusion of benefits under a
34 Medicare supplemental policy during that open enrollment period based on a preexisting
35 condition. Section 6 of this bill adds a similar prohibition with regard to the open enrollment
36 period established under existing law which will apply to both persons who are 65 years of
37 age or older and persons who are less than 65 years of age and suffering from a disability or
38 end-stage renal disease. Section 10 of this bill requires an insurer to establish a similar open
39 enrollment period, which commences on October 1, 2025, and remains open through April 1,
40 2026, for persons who are: (1) less than 65 years of age; (2) suffering from a disability or end-
41 stage renal disease; and (3) enrolled in coverage under Part B of Medicare as of October 1,
42 2025, on the basis of the disability or end-stage renal disease.
43 Sections 7-9 of this bill establish the applicability of section 4 to: (1) a hospital or
44 medical services corporation; and (2) state and local governments that offer insurance to
45 employees. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “Medicare supplemental policy” to have the
46 same meaning as is ascribed to it in federal regulations, and section 2 of this bill establishes
47 the applicability of that definition. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to
48 remove duplicative language from other existing provisions.

20 insurer shall not:

36 687B.015 [As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,
37 “binder”] “Binder” means an oral or written contract for temporary insurance
38 which is used when a policy is not immediately issued to evidence that the coverage

42 687B.352 1. An insurer that issues a Medicare supplemental policy shall
43 offer to a person currently insured under any such policy an annual open enrollment

45 remaining open for at least 60 days thereafter, during which the person may
46 purchase any Medicare supplemental policy made available by the insurer in this
47 State that includes the same or lesser benefits. Innovative benefits, as described in

52 insurer shall not [deny] :
