Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; making a clarification regarding
facilities for skilled nursing; requiring, under certain
circumstances, cities and counties to adopt terms for facilities
for skilled nursing and similar facilities which are the same as
the terms used in state law; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensing and regulation of medical facilities,
which include facilities for skilled nursing. (NRS 449.029-449.240) Existing law
defines a “facility for skilled nursing” to mean an establishment, except for a
hospital, which provides continuous skilled nursing and related care to a patient
who is not in an acute episode of illness and whose primary need is the availability
of such care on a continuous basis. (NRS 449.0039) Section 1 of this bill amends
the definition of “facility for skilled nursing” to clarify that facilities for skilled
nursing provide inpatient care. Section 2 of this bill requires that each county and
city adopt an ordinance using the preceding term in the Nevada Revised Statutes to
describe a facility for skilled nursing. However, a county or city would not be
required to include a specified term in the ordinance if a facility of that type does
not exist in the county or city or if the ordinances do not otherwise refer to a facility
of the type corresponding to the term. Section 4 of this bill deems any facility that
is operating on June 30, 2025, that is considered to be a facility for skilled nursing
or similar facility under a previously adopted ordinance to be a facility for skilled
nursing under an ordinance required by section 2 or 3.
