AN ACT relating to health care; making a clarification regarding
facilities for skilled nursing; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing and regulation of medical facilities,
2 which include facilities for skilled nursing. (NRS 449.029-449.240) Existing law
3 defines a “facility for skilled nursing” to mean an establishment, except for a
4 hospital, which provides continuous skilled nursing and related care to a patient
5 who is not in an acute episode of illness and whose primary need is the availability
6 of such care on a continuous basis. (NRS 449.0039) This bill amends the definition
7 of “facility for skilled nursing” to clarify that facilities for skilled nursing provide
8 inpatient care.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 449.0039 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 449.0039 1. “Facility for skilled nursing” means an
4 establishment which provides inpatient continuous skilled nursing
5 and related care as prescribed by a physician to a patient in the
6 facility who is not in an acute episode of illness and whose primary
7 need is the availability of such care on a continuous basis.
