EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; making a clarification regarding facilities for
skilled nursing; requiring, under certain circumstances, cities and
counties to adopt terms for facilities for skilled nursing and similar
facilities which are the same as the terms used in state law; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing and regulation of medical facilities, which include
2 facilities for skilled nursing. (NRS 449.029-449.240) Existing law defines a “facility for
3 skilled nursing” to mean an establishment, except for a hospital, which provides continuous
4 skilled nursing and related care to a patient who is not in an acute episode of illness and whose
5 primary need is the availability of such care on a continuous basis. (NRS 449.0039) [This]
6 Section 1 of this bill amends the definition of “facility for skilled nursing” to clarify that
7 facilities for skilled nursing provide inpatient care. Section 2 of this bill requires that each
8 county and city adopt an ordinance using the preceding term in the Nevada Revised
9 Statutes to describe a facility for skilled nursing. However, a county or city would not be
10 required to include a specified term in the ordinance if a facility of that type does not
11 exist in the county or city or if the ordinances do not otherwise refer to a facility of the
12 type corresponding to the term. Section 4 of this bill deems any facility that is operating
13 on June 30, 2025, that is considered to be a facility for skilled nursing or similar facility
14 under a previously adopted ordinance to be a facility for skilled nursing under an
15 ordinance required by section 2 or 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 449.0039 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 449.0039 1. “Facility for skilled nursing” means an establishment which
3 provides inpatient continuous skilled nursing and related care as prescribed by a
4 physician to a patient in the facility who is not in an acute episode of illness and
5 whose primary need is the availability of such care on a continuous basis.
