SENATE BILL NO. 330–SENATOR NEAL (BY REQUEST)
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to facilities for skilled
nursing. (BDR 40-584)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; making a clarification regarding
facilities for skilled nursing; requiring, under certain
circumstances, cities and counties to adopt terms for
facilities for skilled nursing and similar facilities which
are the same as the terms used in state law; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing and regulation of medical facilities,
2 which include facilities for skilled nursing. (NRS 449.029-449.240) Existing law
3 defines a “facility for skilled nursing” to mean an establishment, except for a
4 hospital, which provides continuous skilled nursing and related care to a patient
5 who is not in an acute episode of illness and whose primary need is the availability
6 of such care on a continuous basis. (NRS 449.0039) Section 1 of this bill amends
7 the definition of “facility for skilled nursing” to clarify that facilities for skilled
8 nursing provide inpatient care. Section 2 of this bill requires that each county and
9 city adopt an ordinance using the preceding term in the Nevada Revised Statutes to
10 describe a facility for skilled nursing. However, a county or city would not be
11 required to include a specified term in the ordinance if a facility of that type does
12 not exist in the county or city or if the ordinances do not otherwise refer to a facility
13 of the type corresponding to the term. Section 4 of this bill deems any facility that
14 is operating on June 30, 2025, that is considered to be a facility for skilled nursing
15 or similar facility under a previously adopted ordinance to be a facility for skilled
16 nursing under an ordinance required by section 2 or 3.
