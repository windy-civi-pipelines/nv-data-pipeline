EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to
projects for the new construction, repair or reconstruction
of certain buildings, facilities and property of a charter
school; providing administrative penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions
2 governing public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or
3 reconstruction. (Chapter 338 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a
4 charter school to: (1) enter into a contract with specified governmental entities for
5 the provision of facilities to operate the charter school; (2) use any public facility
6 located within the school district in which the charter school is located; or (3)
7 acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
8 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of
9 any of its educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a
10 charter school to provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of
11 any project for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of any building,
12 structure, facility or property, regardless of its ownership, which the charter school
13 uses for any of its educational purposes if the estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2)
14 documentation of compliance with the requirements for competitive bidding for
15 such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the requirements for the
16 payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 of this bill requires the
17 sponsor of the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it receives
18 notification for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions
19 relating to the payment of prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions,
20 competitive bidding with respect to the project, and provides penalties for the
21 failure of a sponsor to comply with this requirement.
