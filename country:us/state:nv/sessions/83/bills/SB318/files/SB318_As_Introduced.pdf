Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as
2 charter schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is
3 authorized to enter into a contract with an educational management organization to
4 provide services relating to the operation and management of the charter school.
5 (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections
6 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the elimination
7 of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a charter school from entering into
8 or renewing a contract with an educational management organization on or after the
9 effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in specified circumstances.
10 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions
11 governing public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or
12 reconstruction. (Chapter 338 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a
13 charter school to: (1) enter into a contract with specified governmental entities for
14 the provision of facilities to operate the charter school; (2) use any public facility
15 located within the school district in which the charter school is located; or (3)
16 acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
17 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of
18 any of its educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a
19 charter school to provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of
-

23 documentation of compliance with the requirements for competitive bidding for
24 such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the requirements for the
25 payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 requires the sponsor of
26 the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it receives notification
27 for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating to the
28 payment of prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with
29 respect to the project, and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply
30 with this requirement.
