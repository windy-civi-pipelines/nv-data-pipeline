EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; eliminating the authority of a charter school to enter
into a contract with certain organizations that provide services relating
to the operation and management of charter schools; revising
provisions relating to projects for the new construction, repair or
reconstruction of certain buildings, facilities and property of a charter
school; providing administrative penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as charter
2 schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is authorized to enter
3 into a contract with an educational management organization to provide services relating to
4 the operation and management of the charter school. (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14
5 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming
6 changes as a result of the elimination of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a
7 charter school from entering into or renewing a contract with an educational management
8 organization on or after the effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in
9 specified circumstances.
10 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a
11 charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the charter school or proposed
12 charter school to request or borrow money from this State to pay the contractor if the
13 contractor will provide financial management to the charter school or proposed charter
14 school. (NRS 388A.393) Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a contract or
15 proposed contract from requiring the charter school or proposed charter school to
16 request or borrow money from this State to pay the contractor.
17 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a
18 charter school or proposed charter school from providing incentive fees to the
19 contractor unless the incentive fees are based on the academic improvement of pupils
20 enrolled in the charter school. Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a
21 contract or proposed contract from providing incentive fees to the contractor.
22 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a
23 charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the governing body of the
24 charter school to pay any costs associated with ensuring that services comply with state
25 and federal law. Section 11 instead prohibits such a contract or proposed contract from
Senate Amendment No. 269 to Senate Bill No. 318 Page 4
26 requiring the governing body of the charter school to pay any costs associated with
27 ensuring the contractor is in compliance with state and federal law.
28 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions governing
29 public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or reconstruction. (Chapter 338
30 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a charter school to: (1) enter into a contract
31 with specified governmental entities for the provision of facilities to operate the charter
32 school; (2) use any public facility located within the school district in which the charter school
33 is located; or (3) acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
34 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of any of its
35 educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a charter school to
36 provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of any project for the new
37 construction, repair or reconstruction of any building, structure, facility or property, regardless
38 of its ownership, which the charter school uses for any of its educational purposes if the
39 estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2) documentation of compliance with the requirements for
40 competitive bidding for such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the
41 requirements for the payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 requires the
42 sponsor of the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it receives notification
43 for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating to the payment of
44 prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with respect to the project,
45 and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply with this requirement.

Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to charter schools. (BDR 34-89)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; eliminating the authority of a charter school to enter
into a contract with certain organizations that provide services relating
to the operation and management of charter schools; revising
provisions relating to projects for the new construction, repair or
reconstruction of certain buildings, facilities and property of a charter
school; providing administrative penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as charter
2 schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is authorized to enter
3 into a contract with an educational management organization to provide services relating to
4 the operation and management of the charter school. (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14
5 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming
6 changes as a result of the elimination of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a
7 charter school from entering into or renewing a contract with an educational management
8 organization on or after the effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in
9 specified circumstances.
10 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a
11 charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the charter school or proposed
12 charter school to request or borrow money from this State to pay the contractor if the
13 contractor will provide financial management to the charter school or proposed charter
14 school. (NRS 388A.393) Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a contract or
15 proposed contract from requiring the charter school or proposed charter school to
16 request or borrow money from this State to pay the contractor.
17 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a
18 charter school or proposed charter school from providing incentive fees to the
19 contractor unless the incentive fees are based on the academic improvement of pupils
20 enrolled in the charter school. Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a
21 contract or proposed contract from providing incentive fees to the contractor.
22 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a
23 charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the governing body of the
24 charter school to pay any costs associated with ensuring that services comply with state
25 and federal law. Section 11 instead prohibits such a contract or proposed contract from

Senate Amendment No. 269 to Senate Bill No. 318 Page 4
26 requiring the governing body of the charter school to pay any costs associated with
27 ensuring the contractor is in compliance with state and federal law.
28 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions governing
29 public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or reconstruction. (Chapter 338
30 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a charter school to: (1) enter into a contract
31 with specified governmental entities for the provision of facilities to operate the charter
32 school; (2) use any public facility located within the school district in which the charter school
33 is located; or (3) acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
34 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of any of its
35 educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a charter school to
36 provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of any project for the new
37 construction, repair or reconstruction of any building, structure, facility or property, regardless
38 of its ownership, which the charter school uses for any of its educational purposes if the
39 estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2) documentation of compliance with the requirements for
40 competitive bidding for such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the
41 requirements for the payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 requires the
42 sponsor of the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it receives notification
43 for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating to the payment of
44 prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with respect to the project,
45 and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply with this requirement.

Senate Amendment No. 269 to Senate Bill No. 318 Page 8
1 differ if the sponsor determines that the amendment is material or strategically
2 important;
3 (e) If deemed appropriate by the sponsor, a strategic plan for recruiting charter
4 management organizations [, educational management organizations] or other
5 persons to operate charter schools based on the priorities of the sponsor and the
6 needs of the pupils that will be served by the charter schools that will be sponsored
7 by the sponsor;
8 (f) A description of how the sponsor will maintain oversight of the charter
9 schools it sponsors, which must include, without limitation:
10 (1) An assessment of the needs of the charter schools that are sponsored by

15 and organizational performance; and
16 (g) A description of the process of evaluation for the charter schools it
17 sponsors in accordance with NRS 388A.351.
18 3. Evidence of material or persistent failure to carry out the powers and duties
19 of a sponsor prescribed by this section constitutes grounds for revocation of the
20 entity’s authority to sponsor charter schools.
21 4. The provisions of this section do not establish a private right of action
