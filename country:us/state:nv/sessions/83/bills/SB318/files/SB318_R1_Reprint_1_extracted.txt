EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; eliminating the authority of a charter
school to enter into a contract with certain organizations
that provide services relating to the operation and
management of charter schools; revising provisions
relating to projects for the new construction, repair or
reconstruction of certain buildings, facilities and property
of a charter school; providing administrative penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as
2 charter schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is
3 authorized to enter into a contract with an educational management organization to
4 provide services relating to the operation and management of the charter school.
5 (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections
6 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the elimination
7 of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a charter school from entering into
8 or renewing a contract with an educational management organization on or after the
9 effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in specified circumstances.
10 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and
11 a charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the charter school or
12 proposed charter school to request or borrow money from this State to pay the
13 contractor if the contractor will provide financial management to the charter school
14 or proposed charter school. (NRS 388A.393) Section 11 prohibits under any
15 circumstances such a contract or proposed contract from requiring the charter
16 school or proposed charter school to request or borrow money from this State to
17 pay the contractor.
18 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and
19 a charter school or proposed charter school from providing incentive fees to the
-
*SB318_R1*
– 2 –
20 contractor unless the incentive fees are based on the academic improvement of
21 pupils enrolled in the charter school. Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances
22 such a contract or proposed contract from providing incentive fees to the contractor.
23 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and
24 a charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the governing body of
25 the charter school to pay any costs associated with ensuring that services comply
26 with state and federal law. Section 11 instead prohibits such a contract or proposed
27 contract from requiring the governing body of the charter school to pay any costs
28 associated with ensuring the contractor is in compliance with state and federal law.
29 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions
30 governing public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or
31 reconstruction. (Chapter 338 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a
32 charter school to: (1) enter into a contract with specified governmental entities for
33 the provision of facilities to operate the charter school; (2) use any public facility
34 located within the school district in which the charter school is located; or (3)
35 acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
36 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of
37 any of its educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a
38 charter school to provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of
39 any project for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of any building,
40 structure, facility or property, regardless of its ownership, which the charter school
41 uses for any of its educational purposes if the estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2)
42 documentation of compliance with the requirements for competitive bidding for
43 such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the requirements for the
44 payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 requires the sponsor of
45 the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it receives notification
46 for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating to the
47 payment of prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with
48 respect to the project, and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply
49 with this requirement.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on April 21, 2025)
FIRST REPRINT S.B. 318
SENATE BILL NO. 318–SENATORS DALY;
DOÑATE, LANGE AND TAYLOR
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to charter schools.
(BDR 34-89)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; eliminating the authority of a charter
school to enter into a contract with certain organizations
that provide services relating to the operation and
management of charter schools; revising provisions
relating to projects for the new construction, repair or
reconstruction of certain buildings, facilities and property
of a charter school; providing administrative penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as
2 charter schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is
3 authorized to enter into a contract with an educational management organization to
4 provide services relating to the operation and management of the charter school.
5 (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections
6 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the elimination
7 of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a charter school from entering into
8 or renewing a contract with an educational management organization on or after the
9 effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in specified circumstances.
10 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and
11 a charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the charter school or
12 proposed charter school to request or borrow money from this State to pay the
13 contractor if the contractor will provide financial management to the charter school
14 or proposed charter school. (NRS 388A.393) Section 11 prohibits under any
15 circumstances such a contract or proposed contract from requiring the charter
16 school or proposed charter school to request or borrow money from this State to
17 pay the contractor.
18 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and
19 a charter school or proposed charter school from providing incentive fees to the
-
*SB318_R1*

– 2 –
20 contractor unless the incentive fees are based on the academic improvement of
21 pupils enrolled in the charter school. Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances
22 such a contract or proposed contract from providing incentive fees to the contractor.
23 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and
24 a charter school or proposed charter school from requiring the governing body of
25 the charter school to pay any costs associated with ensuring that services comply
26 with state and federal law. Section 11 instead prohibits such a contract or proposed
27 contract from requiring the governing body of the charter school to pay any costs
28 associated with ensuring the contractor is in compliance with state and federal law.
29 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions
30 governing public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or
31 reconstruction. (Chapter 338 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a
32 charter school to: (1) enter into a contract with specified governmental entities for
33 the provision of facilities to operate the charter school; (2) use any public facility
34 located within the school district in which the charter school is located; or (3)
35 acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
36 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of
37 any of its educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a
38 charter school to provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of
39 any project for the new construction, repair or reconstruction of any building,
40 structure, facility or property, regardless of its ownership, which the charter school
41 uses for any of its educational purposes if the estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2)
42 documentation of compliance with the requirements for competitive bidding for
43 such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the requirements for the
44 payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 requires the sponsor of
45 the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it receives notification
46 for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating to the
47 payment of prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with
48 respect to the project, and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply
49 with this requirement.
