EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [eliminating the authority of a charter school to
enter into a contract with certain organizations that provide services
relating to the operation and management of charter schools;] revising
provisions relating to projects for the new construction, repair or
reconstruction of certain buildings, facilities and property of a charter
school; providing administrative penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as charter
2 schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is authorized to enter
3 into a contract with an educational management organization to provide services relating to
4 the operation and management of the charter school. (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14
5 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes
6 as a result of the elimination of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a charter school
7 from entering into or renewing a contract with an educational management organization on or
8 after the effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in specified circumstances.
9 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a charter
10 school or proposed charter school from requiring the charter school or proposed charter school
11 to request or borrow money from this State to pay the contractor if the contractor will provide
12 financial management to the charter school or proposed charter school. (NRS 388A.393)
13 Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a contract or proposed contract from
14 requiring the charter school or proposed charter school to request or borrow money from this
15 State to pay the contractor.
16 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a charter
17 school or proposed charter school from providing incentive fees to the contractor unless the
18 incentive fees are based on the academic improvement of pupils enrolled in the charter school.
19 Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a contract or proposed contract from
20 providing incentive fees to the contractor.
21 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a charter
22 school or proposed charter school from requiring the governing body of the charter school to
23 pay any costs associated with ensuring that services comply with state and federal law.
24 Section 11 instead prohibits such a contract or proposed contract from requiring the governing
25 body of the charter school to pay any costs associated with ensuring the contractor is in
26 compliance with state and federal law.]
Senate Amendment No. 911 to Senate Bill No. 318 First Reprint Page 4
27 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions governing
28 public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or reconstruction. (Chapter 338
29 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a charter school to: (1) enter into a contract
30 with specified governmental entities for the provision of facilities to operate the charter
31 school; (2) use any public facility located within the school district in which the charter school
32 is located; or (3) acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
33 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of any of its
34 educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a charter school to
35 provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of any project for the new
36 construction, repair or reconstruction of any building, structure, facility or property, regardless
37 of its ownership, which the charter school uses for any of its educational purposes if the
38 estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2) documentation of compliance with the requirements for
39 competitive bidding for such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the
40 requirements for the payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 of this bill
41 requires the sponsor of the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it
42 receives notification for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating
43 to the payment of prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with
44 respect to the project, and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply with this
45 requirement.

Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to charter schools. (BDR 34-89)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [eliminating the authority of a charter school to
enter into a contract with certain organizations that provide services
relating to the operation and management of charter schools;] revising
provisions relating to projects for the new construction, repair or
reconstruction of certain buildings, facilities and property of a charter
school; providing administrative penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the formation and operation of public schools known as charter
2 schools. (Chapter 388A of NRS) Under existing law, a charter school is authorized to enter
3 into a contract with an educational management organization to provide services relating to
4 the operation and management of the charter school. (NRS 388A.030, 388A.223) Section 14
5 of this bill repeals this authority. Sections 1-9, 11 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes
6 as a result of the elimination of this authority. Section 13 of this bill prohibits a charter school
7 from entering into or renewing a contract with an educational management organization on or
8 after the effective date of this bill, except for a one-time renewal in specified circumstances.
9 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a charter
10 school or proposed charter school from requiring the charter school or proposed charter school
11 to request or borrow money from this State to pay the contractor if the contractor will provide
12 financial management to the charter school or proposed charter school. (NRS 388A.393)
13 Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a contract or proposed contract from
14 requiring the charter school or proposed charter school to request or borrow money from this
15 State to pay the contractor.
16 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a charter
17 school or proposed charter school from providing incentive fees to the contractor unless the
18 incentive fees are based on the academic improvement of pupils enrolled in the charter school.
19 Section 11 prohibits under any circumstances such a contract or proposed contract from
20 providing incentive fees to the contractor.
21 Existing law prohibits a contract or proposed contract between a contractor and a charter
22 school or proposed charter school from requiring the governing body of the charter school to
23 pay any costs associated with ensuring that services comply with state and federal law.
24 Section 11 instead prohibits such a contract or proposed contract from requiring the governing
25 body of the charter school to pay any costs associated with ensuring the contractor is in
26 compliance with state and federal law.]

Senate Amendment No. 911 to Senate Bill No. 318 First Reprint Page 4
27 Under existing law, a charter school is a public body to which the provisions governing
28 public works apply to its projects for new construction, repair or reconstruction. (Chapter 338
29 of NRS; NRS 388A.320) Existing law authorizes a charter school to: (1) enter into a contract
30 with specified governmental entities for the provision of facilities to operate the charter
31 school; (2) use any public facility located within the school district in which the charter school
32 is located; or (3) acquire and construct, reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip and furnish any
33 building, structure or property and complete related improvements for the use of any of its
34 educational purposes. (NRS 388A.378) Section 10 of this bill requires a charter school to
35 provide to the sponsor of the charter school: (1) written notice of any project for the new
36 construction, repair or reconstruction of any building, structure, facility or property, regardless
37 of its ownership, which the charter school uses for any of its educational purposes if the
38 estimated cost exceeds $100,000; (2) documentation of compliance with the requirements for
39 competitive bidding for such a project; and (3) records relating to compliance with the
40 requirements for the payment of prevailing wages on such a project. Section 4 of this bill
41 requires the sponsor of the charter school to ensure that a charter school from which it
42 receives notification for a project pursuant to section 10 complies with the provisions relating
43 to the payment of prevailing wages and, with certain exceptions, competitive bidding with
44 respect to the project, and provides penalties for the failure of a sponsor to comply with this
45 requirement.
