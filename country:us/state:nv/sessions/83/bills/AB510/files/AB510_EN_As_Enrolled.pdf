Assembly Bill No. 510–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to accountants; revising the requirements for the
granting of a certificate of certified public accountant;
requiring the Nevada State Board of Accountancy to
prescribe by regulation certain requirements and standards
for the issuance of a certificate of certified public accountant;
revising provisions governing certain fees that the Board is
authorized or required to charge; revising provisions
governing the examination required for the issuance of a
certificate of certified public accountant; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the regulation of accountants in this State by the
Nevada State Board of Accountancy. (Chapter 628 of NRS)
Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to the education and work
experience required for a person to be issued a certificate of certified public
accountant. (NRS 628.200) Section 2 of this bill eliminates those requirements and
instead requires the Board to prescribe by regulation the requirements and standards
for education and work experience which the Board deems appropriate for the
issuance of a certificate of certified public accountant. Section 2 sets forth certain
requirements for those regulations. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming
change to reflect the elimination of the requirements for education and work
experience in section 2 and the authority of the Board to adopt such requirements
by regulation.
With certain exceptions, existing law requires the Board to grant a certificate of
certified public accountant to a person who satisfies certain requirements for
education, work experience and passing an examination as set forth in statute.
(NRS 628.190) Section 1 of this bill revises these provisions to require the Board,
with certain exceptions, to grant such a certificate to a person who: (1) complies
with the requirements and standards of education and work experience prescribed
in regulations adopted by the Board; and (2) has passed all sections of the
examination prescribed by the Board in accordance with the terms and conditions
prescribed in any regulations adopted by the Board. Section 1 also provides that an
applicant for such a certificate is subject to the educational requirements to receive
a certificate that were in effect on the date on which the applicant passed all
sections of the examination prescribed in the regulations of the Board.
Existing law authorizes the Board to establish a fee for the evaluation of the
experience of a candidate for a certificate of certified public accountant. (NRS
628.250) Section 3 of this bill eliminates the authority of the Board to establish
such a fee.
Existing law authorizes the Board to prescribe by regulation the terms and
conditions under which a candidate for a certificate of certified public accountant:
(1) may receive conditional credit for passing at least one section, but not all
sections, of the examination required to qualify for the certificate; and (2) need not
sit for reexamination in sections which the candidate has passed and for which he
or she has received conditional credit. Existing law also authorizes the Board to
provide by regulation a limit on the time in which a candidate must pass all sections
-

– 2 –
of the examination or lose any credit received. (NRS 628.260) Section 4 of this bill
clarifies the authority of the Board with respect to the establishment of terms and
conditions concerning the passage of the required examination by specifying that
the regulations of the Board may, but are not required, to: (1) authorize a candidate
who has not passed all sections of the examination to receive credit for any section
of the examination passed without being required to sit for reexamination of those
sections; and (2) provide a limit on the time in which a candidate must pass all
sections of the examination or lose any such credit received.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe a fee for
registering a fictitious name with the Board. (NRS 628.375) Section 6 of this bill
removes this requirement and instead authorizes the Board to establish such a fee.
