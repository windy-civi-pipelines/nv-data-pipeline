SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to cemeteries.
(BDR 40-874)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the
disinterment and removal of human remains from certain
cemeteries; revising certain requirements applicable to
certain cemetery owners; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and
2 removal of all human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a
3 governmental authority other than the cemetery authority makes certain
4 determinations relating to the maintenance of the cemetery in accordance with the
5 health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery authority determines that
6 financial provision must be made for future care of certain gravesites. (NRS 451.070)
7 Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery authority may disinter or
8 remove human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery: (1) the cemetery
9 authority must petition the district court of the county in which a cemetery is located
10 for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal; and (2) the court must issue an
11 order authorizing the disinterment and removal. Sections 2-4 of this bill make
12 conforming changes relating to the issuance by the court, rather than the cemetery
13 authority, of an order for the disinterment and removal of human remains interred in a
14 cemetery.
15 Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an
16 orderly condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make rules
17 relating to this requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the
18 authority of a board of county commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5
19 requires the owner of a cemetery to take certain specific actions to ensure that a
20 cemetery is kept in an orderly condition. Section 5 also: (1) requires the board of
21 county commissioners of each county to ensure that the owner of a cemetery complies
22 with these requirements; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to
23 require the owner of a cemetery to take corrective action under certain circumstances.
