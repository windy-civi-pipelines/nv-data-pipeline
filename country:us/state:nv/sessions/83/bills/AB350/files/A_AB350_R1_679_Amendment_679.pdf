FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the disinterment and
removal of human remains from certain cemeteries; revising certain
requirements applicable to certain cemetery owners; expanding
eligibility for interment in a veterans’ cemetery to include certain
additional veterans; requiring the Director of the Department of
Veterans Services to charge certain fees relating to the interment
of such veterans; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and removal of all
2 human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a governmental authority other
3 than the cemetery authority makes certain determinations relating to the maintenance of the
4 cemetery in accordance with the health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery
5 authority determines that a financial provision must be made for the future care of certain
6 gravesites. (NRS 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery
7 authority may disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery: (1)
8 the cemetery authority must petition the district court of the county in which a cemetery is
9 located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal; and (2) the court must issue an
10 order authorizing the disinterment and removal. Sections 2-4 of this bill make conforming
11 changes relating to the issuance by the court, rather than the cemetery authority, of an order
12 for the disinterment and removal of human remains interred in a cemetery.
13 Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an orderly
14 condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make rules relating to this
15 requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the authority of a board of county
16 commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5 requires the owner of a cemetery to take
17 certain specific actions to ensure that a cemetery is kept in an orderly condition.
18 Existing law provides for the establishment, operation and maintenance of veterans’
19 cemeteries and sets forth the eligibility requirements for the interment of veterans in
20 such cemeteries. (NRS 417.210) Section 6 of this bill expands the eligibility requirements
21 to include certain veterans who were members of a reserve component of the National
22 Guard or who received a commemorative plaque or urn furnished by the United States
23 Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 6 also requires the Director of the Department
24 of Veterans Services to charge a fee for: (1) the interment of a veteran made eligible
25 under the expanded criteria set forth in section 6; and (2) a headstone or marker

26 provided by the Department for certain veterans made eligible for interment under the
27 expanded criteria set forth in section 6.

1 Section 1. NRS 451.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 451.070 1. Except as otherwise provided in [NRS 451.075,] subsection 7, a

4 any part of a cemetery owned, leased or operated by the cemetery authority
5 without a court order authorizing the cemetery authority to do so.
6 2. A cemetery authority may petition the district court of the county in
7 which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal
8 of [all] human remains interred in all or any part of [any] a cemetery [if:
9 1. A governmental authority other than the cemetery authority determines

15 3. Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to subsection 2, the court shall fix
16 a time for a hearing on the matter. The petitioner shall provide notice and a copy
17 of the petition to every person who owns, holds or has the right of interment in
18 any plot of the cemetery or part affected whose name appears on the records of
19 the cemetery or upon the real property assessment roll of the county in which the

23 opportunity to be heard on the matter.
24 4. After the hearing described in subsection 3, the court may issue an order
25 authorizing the disinterment and removal of human remains from all or any part

27 (a) The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
28 (1) The maintenance of all or any part of the cemetery that is the subject of
29 the petition as a burial place for the human dead is not in accordance with the
30 health, safety, comfort or welfare of the public;
31 [(b)] (2) The cemetery authority is unable to restore the cemetery or part of the

34 safety, comfort and welfare of the public; and
35 [(c)] (3) The cemetery authority is unable, at current market rates, to sell or
36 lease the cemetery that is the subject of the petition to or enter into a contract with
37 another cemetery authority that will maintain the cemetery that is the subject of the
38 petition as a burial place for the human dead in accordance with the health, safety,
39 comfort and welfare of the public; or
40 [2.] (b) The [cemetery authority determines] court finds by clear and
41 convincing evidence that such disinterment and removal is necessary because of
42 the financial [provision must be made] obligations of the cemetery authority for
43 future care of gravesites within a specified area.
