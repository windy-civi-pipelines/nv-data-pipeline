ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 350–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
MARCH 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to cemeteries.
(BDR 40-874)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the
disinterment and removal of human remains from certain
cemeteries; revising certain requirements applicable to
certain cemetery owners; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and
2 removal of all human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a
3 governmental authority other than the cemetery authority makes certain
4 determinations relating to the maintenance of the cemetery in accordance with the
5 health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery authority determines
6 that financial provision must be made for future care of certain gravesites. (NRS
7 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery authority
8 may disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery: (1)
9 the cemetery authority must petition the district court of the county in which a
10 cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal; and (2)
11 the court must issue an order authorizing the disinterment and removal. Sections 2-
12 4 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the issuance by the court, rather
13 than the cemetery authority, of an order for the disinterment and removal of human
14 remains interred in a cemetery.
15 Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an
16 orderly condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make
17 rules relating to this requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the
18 authority of a board of county commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5
19 requires the owner of a cemetery to take certain specific actions to ensure that a
20 cemetery is kept in an orderly condition.
