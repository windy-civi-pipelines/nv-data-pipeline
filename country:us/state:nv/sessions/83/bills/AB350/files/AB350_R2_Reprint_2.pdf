EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the
disinterment and removal of human remains from certain
cemeteries; revising certain requirements applicable to
certain cemetery owners; expanding eligibility for
interment in a veterans’ cemetery to include certain
additional veterans; requiring the Director of the
Department of Veterans Services to charge certain fees
relating to the interment of such veterans; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and
2 removal of all human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a
3 governmental authority other than the cemetery authority makes certain
4 determinations relating to the maintenance of the cemetery in accordance with the
5 health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery authority determines
6 that a financial provision must be made for the future care of certain gravesites.
7 (NRS 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery
8 authority may disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a
9 cemetery: (1) the cemetery authority must petition the district court of the county in
10 which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal;
11 and (2) the court must issue an order authorizing the disinterment and removal.
12 Sections 2-4 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the issuance by the
13 court, rather than the cemetery authority, of an order for the disinterment and
14 removal of human remains interred in a cemetery.
15 Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an
16 orderly condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make
17 rules relating to this requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the
18 authority of a board of county commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5
-
*AB350_R2*

– 2 –
19 requires the owner of a cemetery to take certain specific actions to ensure that a
20 cemetery is kept in an orderly condition.
21 Existing law provides for the establishment, operation and maintenance of
22 veterans’ cemeteries and sets forth the eligibility requirements for the interment of
23 veterans in such cemeteries. (NRS 417.210) Section 6 of this bill expands the
24 eligibility requirements to include certain veterans who were members of a reserve
25 component of the National Guard or who received a commemorative plaque or urn
26 furnished by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 6 also
27 requires the Director of the Department of Veterans Services to charge a fee for: (1)
28 the interment of a veteran made eligible under the expanded criteria set forth in
29 section 6; and (2) a headstone or marker provided by the Department for certain
30 veterans made eligible for interment under the expanded criteria set forth in section
31 6.

7 2. A cemetery authority may petition the district court of the
8 county in which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the

22 cemetery or part affected whose name appears on the records of
23 the cemetery or upon the real property assessment roll of the
24 county in which the cemetery is located. If a person who receives

1 4. After the hearing described in subsection 3, the court may

19 comfort and welfare of the public; or
20 [2.] (b) The [cemetery authority determines] court finds by clear
