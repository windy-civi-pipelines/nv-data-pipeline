Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the
disinterment and removal of human remains from certain
cemeteries; revising certain requirements applicable to
certain cemetery owners; expanding eligibility for interment
in a veterans’ cemetery to include certain additional veterans;
requiring the Director of the Department of Veterans Services
to charge certain fees relating to the interment of such
veterans; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and
removal of all human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a
governmental authority other than the cemetery authority makes certain
determinations relating to the maintenance of the cemetery in accordance with the
health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery authority determines
that a financial provision must be made for the future care of certain gravesites.
(NRS 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery
authority may disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a
cemetery: (1) the cemetery authority must petition the district court of the county in
which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal;
and (2) the court must issue an order authorizing the disinterment and removal.

Section 2:
Sections 2-4 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the issuance by the
court, rather than the cemetery authority, of an order for the disinterment and
removal of human remains interred in a cemetery.
Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an
orderly condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make
rules relating to this requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the
authority of a board of county commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5
requires the owner of a cemetery to take certain specific actions to ensure that a
cemetery is kept in an orderly condition.
Existing law provides for the establishment, operation and maintenance of
veterans’ cemeteries and sets forth the eligibility requirements for the interment of
veterans in such cemeteries. (NRS 417.210) Section 6 of this bill expands the
eligibility requirements to include certain veterans who were members of a reserve
component of the National Guard or who received a commemorative plaque or urn
furnished by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 6 also
requires the Director of the Department of Veterans Services to charge a fee for: (1)
the interment of a veteran made eligible under the expanded criteria set forth in

Section 3:
section 6; and (2) a headstone or marker provided by the Department for certain
veterans made eligible for interment under the expanded criteria set forth in

Section 4:
section 6.

Assembly Bill No. 350–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the
disinterment and removal of human remains from certain
cemeteries; revising certain requirements applicable to
certain cemetery owners; expanding eligibility for interment
in a veterans’ cemetery to include certain additional veterans;
requiring the Director of the Department of Veterans Services
to charge certain fees relating to the interment of such
veterans; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and
removal of all human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a
governmental authority other than the cemetery authority makes certain
determinations relating to the maintenance of the cemetery in accordance with the
health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery authority determines
that a financial provision must be made for the future care of certain gravesites.
(NRS 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery
authority may disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a
cemetery: (1) the cemetery authority must petition the district court of the county in
which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal;
and (2) the court must issue an order authorizing the disinterment and removal.
Sections 2-4 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the issuance by the
court, rather than the cemetery authority, of an order for the disinterment and
removal of human remains interred in a cemetery.
Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an
orderly condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make
rules relating to this requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the
authority of a board of county commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5
requires the owner of a cemetery to take certain specific actions to ensure that a
cemetery is kept in an orderly condition.
Existing law provides for the establishment, operation and maintenance of
veterans’ cemeteries and sets forth the eligibility requirements for the interment of
veterans in such cemeteries. (NRS 417.210) Section 6 of this bill expands the
eligibility requirements to include certain veterans who were members of a reserve
component of the National Guard or who received a commemorative plaque or urn
furnished by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 6 also
requires the Director of the Department of Veterans Services to charge a fee for: (1)
the interment of a veteran made eligible under the expanded criteria set forth in
section 6; and (2) a headstone or marker provided by the Department for certain
veterans made eligible for interment under the expanded criteria set forth in
section 6.
