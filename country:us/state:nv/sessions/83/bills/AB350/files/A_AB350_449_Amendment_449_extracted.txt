SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to cemeteries. (BDR 40-874)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the disinterment and
removal of human remains from certain cemeteries; revising certain
requirements applicable to certain cemetery owners; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and removal of all
2 human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a governmental authority other
3 than the cemetery authority makes certain determinations relating to the maintenance of the
4 cemetery in accordance with the health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery
5 authority determines that financial provision must be made for future care of certain gravesites.
6 (NRS 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery authority may
7 disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery: (1) the cemetery
8 authority must petition the district court of the county in which a cemetery is located for an order
9 authorizing the disinterment and removal; and (2) the court must issue an order authorizing the
10 disinterment and removal. Sections 2-4 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
11 issuance by the court, rather than the cemetery authority, of an order for the disinterment and
12 removal of human remains interred in a cemetery.
13 Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an orderly
14 condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make rules relating to this
15 requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the authority of a board of county
16 commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5 requires the owner of a cemetery to take
17 certain specific actions to ensure that a cemetery is kept in an orderly condition. [Section 5 also:
18 (1) requires the board of county commissioners of each county to ensure that the owner of a
19 cemetery complies with these requirements; and (2) authorizes a board of county
20 commissioners to require the owner of a cemetery to take corrective action under certain
21 circumstances.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 451.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 451.070 1. Except as otherwise provided in [NRS 451.075,] subsection [6,]

1 or any part of a cemetery owned, leased or operated by the cemetery authority
2 without a court order authorizing the cemetery authority to do so.
3 2. A cemetery authority may petition the district court of the county in
4 which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal
5 of [all] human remains interred in all or any part of [any] a cemetery [if:
6 1. A governmental authority other than the cemetery authority determines
7 that:] owned, leased or operated by the cemetery authority. The petition must:

9 and
10 (b) Be accompanied by adequate documentation to justify a hearing on the

16 the cemetery or upon the real property assessment roll of the county in which the
17 cemetery is located. If a person who receives such notice wishes to oppose the

19 appears before the court at the hearing, the court must provide the person an
20 opportunity to be heard on the matter.
21 4. After the hearing described in subsection 3, the court may issue an order
22 authorizing the disinterment and removal of human remains from all or any part

24 (a) The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
25 (1) The maintenance of all or any part of the cemetery that is the subject of
26 the petition as a burial place for the human dead is not in accordance with the
27 health, safety, comfort or welfare of the public;
28 [(b)] (2) The cemetery authority is unable to restore the cemetery or part of the
29 cemetery that is the subject of the petition to a condition where the maintenance of
30 the cemetery as a burial place for the human dead is in accordance with the health,
31 safety, comfort and welfare of the public; and
32 [(c)] (3) The cemetery authority is unable, at current market rates, to sell or
33 lease the cemetery that is the subject of the petition to or enter into a contract with
34 another cemetery authority that will maintain the cemetery that is the subject of the
35 petition as a burial place for the human dead in accordance with the health, safety,
36 comfort and welfare of the public; or
37 [2.] (b) The [cemetery authority determines] court finds by clear and
38 convincing evidence that such disinterment and removal is necessary because of
39 the financial [provision must be made] obligations of the cemetery authority for
40 future care of gravesites within a specified area.
41 5. Upon the issuance of an order pursuant to subsection 4, a cemetery
42 authority may proceed to disinter and remove the remains in accordance with the

44 6. The cemetery authority shall:

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to cemeteries. (BDR 40-874)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cemeteries; revising provisions relating to the disinterment and
removal of human remains from certain cemeteries; revising certain
requirements applicable to certain cemetery owners; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a cemetery authority to order the disinterment and removal of all
2 human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery if: (1) a governmental authority other
3 than the cemetery authority makes certain determinations relating to the maintenance of the
4 cemetery in accordance with the health, safety and comfort of the public; or (2) the cemetery
5 authority determines that financial provision must be made for future care of certain gravesites.
6 (NRS 451.070) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that, before a cemetery authority may
7 disinter or remove human remains interred in all or any part of a cemetery: (1) the cemetery
8 authority must petition the district court of the county in which a cemetery is located for an order
9 authorizing the disinterment and removal; and (2) the court must issue an order authorizing the
10 disinterment and removal. Sections 2-4 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
11 issuance by the court, rather than the cemetery authority, of an order for the disinterment and
12 removal of human remains interred in a cemetery.
13 Existing law: (1) requires the owner of a cemetery to keep the cemetery in an orderly
14 condition; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners to make rules relating to this
15 requirement. (NRS 452.030) Section 5 of this bill removes the authority of a board of county
16 commissioners to make such rules. Instead, section 5 requires the owner of a cemetery to take
17 certain specific actions to ensure that a cemetery is kept in an orderly condition. [Section 5 also:
18 (1) requires the board of county commissioners of each county to ensure that the owner of a
19 cemetery complies with these requirements; and (2) authorizes a board of county
20 commissioners to require the owner of a cemetery to take corrective action under certain
21 circumstances.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 451.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 451.070 1. Except as otherwise provided in [NRS 451.075,] subsection [6,]

3 2. A cemetery authority may petition the district court of the county in
4 which a cemetery is located for an order authorizing the disinterment and removal
5 of [all] human remains interred in all or any part of [any] a cemetery [if:
6 1. A governmental authority other than the cemetery authority determines
7 that:] owned, leased or operated by the cemetery authority. The petition must:

17 cemetery is located. If a person who receives such notice wishes to oppose the

20 opportunity to be heard on the matter.
21 4. After the hearing described in subsection 3, the court may issue an order
22 authorizing the disinterment and removal of human remains from all or any part

25 (1) The maintenance of all or any part of the cemetery that is the subject of
26 the petition as a burial place for the human dead is not in accordance with the
27 health, safety, comfort or welfare of the public;
28 [(b)] (2) The cemetery authority is unable to restore the cemetery or part of the

34 another cemetery authority that will maintain the cemetery that is the subject of the
35 petition as a burial place for the human dead in accordance with the health, safety,
36 comfort and welfare of the public; or
37 [2.] (b) The [cemetery authority determines] court finds by clear and
