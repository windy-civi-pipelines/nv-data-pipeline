AN ACT relating to vehicles; revising provisions relating to certain
traffic and related violations; revising provisions relating
to the suspension of the driver’s license of a person; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature enacted Assembly Bill
2 No. 116 (A.B. 116), which established civil penalties for certain traffic and related
3 violations and enacted procedures for the adjudication of such violations.
4 (Assembly Bill No. 116, chapter 506, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3297) The
5 procedures for the adjudication of civil infractions prescribed by A.B. 116 were
6 based, in part, on the procedures for the adjudication of criminal violations
7 prescribed by chapter 176 of NRS.
8 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature also enacted Senate Bill
9 No. 219 (S.B. 219), which revised certain statutory provisions upon which the
10 requirements prescribed by A.B. 116 were based by removing the authority of a
11 court to suspend the driver’s license of a defendant or prohibit a defendant from
12 applying for a driver’s license for a specified period as a result of any delinquent
13 fine, administrative assessment, fee or restitution owed. (Senate Bill No. 219,
14 chapter 505, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3292)
15 Section 2 of this bill makes a technical change to align provisions relating to
16 the adjudication of certain traffic and related civil infractions with the changes
17 made by S.B. 219. Specifically, section 2 removes the authority of a court to order
18 the suspension of the driver’s license of a person or prohibit a person from applying
19 for a driver’s license for a specified period as a result of a delinquent fine,
20 administrative assessment or fee associated with a civil penalty imposed for a

– 2 –
21 traffic or related violation. (NRS 484A.7047) Section 1 of this bill makes a
22 conforming change relating to the removal of the authority of a court to suspend the
23 driver’s license of a person pursuant to section 2.
24 Section 3 of this bill provides that if, on or after the effective date of this bill, a
25 person is subject to a suspension of his or her driver’s license or a delay in the
26 issuance of a driver’s license imposed for failure to pay a delinquent fine,
27 administrative assessment or fee, the Department of Motor Vehicles must: (1)
28 immediately reinstate the driver’s license of the person or the ability of the person
29 to apply for the issuance of a driver’s license; and (2) notify the person, as soon as
30 possible, of the reinstatement of his or her driver’s license or ability to apply for the
31 issuance of a driver’s license. Section 3 also provides that the Department may not
32 charge any fee for such reinstatement of a driver’s license or require a person to
33 undergo any physical or mental examination to be eligible for such reinstatement of
34 a driver’s license.
35 Existing law prescribes the required contents of traffic citations and civil
36 infraction citations. (NRS 484A.630, 484A.7035) Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of this bill
37 revise the required contents of such citations.
38 Existing law provides that the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction
39 over a child who is alleged to have committed an act designated as a delinquent act,
40 unless an exception applies. (NRS 62B.330, 62B.390) Under existing law, certain
41 offenses are not considered delinquent acts and are therefore excluded from the
42 jurisdiction of the juvenile court. (NRS 62B.330) Section 2.76 of this bill provides
43 that violations of law that are punishable as civil infractions are not considered
44 delinquent acts and are therefore excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile
45 court. Existing law grants justice courts and municipal courts jurisdiction to hear
46 and dispose of violations of law that are punishable as civil infractions. (NRS
47 4.370, 5.050) Therefore, section 2.76 clarifies that justice courts and municipal
48 courts have jurisdiction to hear and dispose of violations of law that are punishable
49 as civil infractions, regardless of the age of the person alleged to have committed
50 the violation.
51 Existing law authorizes a peace officer to request the electronic mail address
52 and mobile telephone number of a person to whom a traffic citation is issued for the
53 purpose of enabling the court in which the person is required to appear to
54 communicate with the person. (NRS 484A.630) Section 1.4 similarly authorizes a
55 peace officer to request the electronic mail address and mobile telephone number of
56 a person to whom a civil infraction citation is issued for the same purpose.
57 Existing law requires a court to send certain notice to a person who receives a
58 civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.704) Section 1.6 of this bill requires this notice
59 to include certain information regarding any online program of dispute resolution
60 established by the court.
61 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain courts and traffic violations bureaus to
62 establish a system through which certain persons may perform certain actions
63 related to a traffic citation or civil infraction citation; and (2) prescribes certain
64 requirements relating to any such system. (NRS 484A.615) Section 1.2 of this bill
65 additionally requires any such system to be capable of allowing certain persons to
66 submit the state registration number of the vehicle the person was driving when the
67 citation was issued.
68 Existing law requires a person who receives a civil infraction citation to
69 respond to the citation within 90 days after the date on which the citation is issued.
70 Section 1.6 instead requires such a person to respond to the citation within 90 days
71 after the date on which the citation is issued or filed with the court, whichever is
72 later. Section 1.4 makes a conforming change relating to the revised deadline set
73 forth in section 1.6.
74 Under existing law, if a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not
75 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth
-
*SB104_R3*

– 3 –
76 in the citation, the person must respond to the citation by: (1) indicating that the
77 person does not contest the determination; and (2) submitting full payment of the
78 monetary penalty specified in the citation. (NRS 484A.704) Section 1.6 revises this
79 requirement by authorizing such a person to request that the court waive or reduce
80 the monetary penalty specified in the citation or enter into a payment plan with the
81 person in lieu of requiring the person to submit full payment of the monetary
82 penalty specified in the citation. Section 1.8 of this bill authorizes the court to
83 waive or reduce the monetary penalty or enter into a payment plan with a person
84 who submits a request pursuant to section 1.6 under certain circumstances.
85 Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may
86 contest whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction
87 citation and generally requires the person to post a bond in an amount equal to the
88 monetary penalty, administrative assessments and fees specified in the civil
89 infraction citation or alternatively deposit such an amount in cash with the court.
90 (NRS 484A.7041) Section 1.7 of this bill eliminates the requirement that a person
91 who requests a hearing must post a bond or deposit cash with the court.
92 Existing law authorizes a court having jurisdiction over a civil infraction to
93 reduce any moving violation for which a person was issued a civil infraction
94 citation to a nonmoving violation if the court determines that any circumstances
95 warrant such a reduction. (NRS 484A.7043) Section 1.8 clarifies that the court is
96 not required to hold a hearing before reducing a moving violation to a nonmoving
97 violation.
98 Under existing law, any civil penalty assessed against a person who is found to
99 have committed a civil infraction must be paid to: (1) the treasurer of the city in
100 which the civil infraction occurred; or (2) if the civil infraction did not occur in a
101 city, the treasurer of the county in which the civil infraction occurred.
102 (NRS 484A.7043) Section 1.8 instead requires any such civil penalty to be paid to
103 the treasurer of the city or county, as applicable, in which the civil infraction
104 citation was filed.
105 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain
106 traffic and related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil
107 infraction; and (2) provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to
108 this procedure, existing law requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election
109 on or before the time scheduled for the first appearance of the defendant. (NRS
110 484A.7049) Section 2.2 of this bill: (1) authorizes the prosecuting attorney to make
111 the election at any time before the court enters a judgment of conviction; and (2)
112 eliminates certain procedural requirements relating to making such an election.
113 Section 2.2 also authorizes the district attorney or city attorney of any county or
114 city, respectively, to authorize a traffic enforcement agency over whom the district
115 attorney or city attorney has jurisdiction to elect to treat certain traffic and related
116 offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil infraction. Finally,
117 section 2.2 provides that a bench warrant may not be issued for a violation that is
118 treated as a civil infraction.
119 Existing law authorizes a peace officer to arrest a person without a warrant if
120 the peace officer has reasonable cause for believing that the person has committed
121 homicide by vehicle, certain offenses involving driving under the influence and
122 certain other traffic and related offenses. (NRS 484A.710) Section 2.6 of this bill
123 authorizes a peace officer who has reasonable cause for believing that a person has
124 committed a violation for which existing law authorizes the peace officer to arrest a
125 person to also arrest the person without a warrant for an offense that is punishable
126 as a civil infraction. Section 2.4 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to
127 arrests authorized by section 2.6.
128 Existing law establishes the jurisdiction of justice courts. (NRS 4.370) Section
129 2.67 of this bill authorizes the justice court to transfer original jurisdiction of a civil
130 infraction to the district court or juvenile court if: (1) the person charged with the
-
*SB104_R3*

– 4 –
131 civil infraction is a person under 18 years of age; and (2) the district court or
132 juvenile court, as applicable, approves the transfer.
133 Existing law provides certain persons with immunity from liability for certain
134 acts or omissions under certain circumstances. (Chapter 41 of NRS) Section 2.7 of
135 this bill provides that a prosecuting attorney who prosecutes a person charged with
136 a civil infraction or a violation of a traffic ordinance that is punishable by the
137 imposition of a civil penalty is immune from liability to the same extent as a
138 prosecuting attorney who prosecutes a person charged with violating a criminal law
139 of this State. Sections 2.72 and 2.74 of this bill make conforming changes to
140 indicate the proper placement of section 2.7 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
141 Section 2.8 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide
142 by ordinance that a violation of a traffic ordinance enacted by the board imposes a
143 civil penalty instead of a criminal sanction.
144 Section 2.9 of this bill requires the Department of Public Safety, in consultation
145 with law enforcement agencies and courts of this State, to: (1) study best practices
146 for developing and implementing a standardized, statewide uniform civil infraction
147 citation; and (2) submit its findings and recommendations for legislation to the
148 Joint Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary. Section 2.95 of this bill
149 requires justice courts and municipal courts, on or before January 1, 2024, to adopt
150 rules governing the practice and procedure for setting aside a default judgment in
151 an action relating to a civil infraction.

1 Sec. 1.3. NRS 484A.630 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 484A.630 1. Whenever a person is halted by a peace officer
4 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and is
5 not taken before a magistrate as required or permitted by NRS
6 484A.720 and 484A.730, the peace officer must prepare a traffic
7 citation manually or electronically in the form of a complaint
8 issuing in the name of “The State of Nevada,” containing a notice to
9 appear in court, the name and address of the person, the state
10 registration number of the [person’s] vehicle [,] the person was
11 driving when the citation was issued, if any, the number of the
12 person’s driver’s license, if any, the offense charged, including a
13 brief description of the offense and the NRS citation, the time and
14 place when and where the person is required to appear in court, and
15 such other pertinent information as may be necessary. The peace
16 officer may also request, and the person may provide, the electronic
17 mail address and mobile telephone number of the person for the
18 purpose of enabling the court in which the person is required to
19 appear to communicate with the person. If the peace officer requests
20 such information, the peace officer shall expressly inform the person
21 that providing such information is voluntary and, if the person
22 provides such information, the person thereby gives his or her
23 consent for the court to communicate with the person through such
24 means. The peace officer shall sign the citation and deliver a copy of
25 the citation to the person charged with the violation. If the citation is
26 prepared electronically, the peace officer shall sign the copy of the
27 citation that is delivered to the person charged with the violation.
28 2. The time specified in the notice to appear must be at least 5
29 days after the alleged violation.
30 3. The place specified in the notice to appear must be before a

32 4. The person charged with the violation may give his or her
33 written promise to appear in court by signing or physically receiving
34 at least one copy of the traffic citation prepared by the peace officer
35 and thereupon the peace officer shall not take the person into
36 physical custody for the violation. If the citation is prepared
37 electronically, the peace officer shall indicate on the electronic
38 record of the citation whether the person charged gave his or her
39 written promise to appear. A copy of the citation that is signed by
40 the person charged or the electronic record of the citation which
41 indicates that the person charged gave his or her written promise to
42 appear suffices as proof of service.
43 5. If the person charged with the violation refuses to sign a
44 copy of the traffic citation but physically receives a copy of the
45 citation delivered by the peace officer:
-

12 enforcement agency pursuant to NRS 484A.7049, for a violation
13 of certain such provisions that is punishable as a misdemeanor, or
14 a prosecuting attorney elects to treat a violation of chapters 483 to
15 484E, inclusive, 486 or 490 of NRS that is punishable as a
16 misdemeanor instead as a civil infraction in accordance with NRS
17 484A.7049, the peace officer or prosecuting attorney, as applicable,
18 may prepare a civil infraction citation manually or electronically in
19 the form of a complaint issuing in the name of “The State of

22 (a) A statement that the citation represents a determination by a
23 peace officer or prosecuting attorney that a civil infraction has been

42 forfeited if the order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
43 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff
44 during the proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the

21 the person would be required to pay if the civil penalty were a fine
22 imposed on a defendant who pleads guilty or guilty but mentally ill
23 or is found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of a misdemeanor. If, in
24 lieu of a civil penalty, the court authorizes a person to successfully
25 complete a course of traffic safety approved by the Department of

5 pay if the court determines that any circumstances warrant such a
6 waiver or reduction.
7 (c) Reduce any moving violation for which a person was issued
8 a civil infraction citation to a nonmoving violation if the court
9 determines that any circumstances warrant such a reduction.
10 5. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a
11 court having jurisdiction over a civil infraction pursuant to NRS
12 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive, to hold a hearing before
13 reducing a moving violation for which a person was issued a civil

13 a driver’s license for a specified period. If the delinquent person is
14 already the subject of a court order suspending or delaying the
15 issuance of his or her driver’s license, the court may order the
16 additional suspension or delay, as appropriate, to apply
17 consecutively with the previous order. At the time the court issues
18 an order pursuant to this paragraph suspending the driver’s license
19 of a delinquent person or delaying the ability of a delinquent person
20 to apply for a driver’s license, the court shall, within 5 days after
21 issuing the order, forward to the Department a copy of the order.
22 The Department shall report a suspension pursuant to this paragraph
23 to an insurance company or its agent inquiring about the delinquent
24 person’s driving record, but such a suspension must not be
