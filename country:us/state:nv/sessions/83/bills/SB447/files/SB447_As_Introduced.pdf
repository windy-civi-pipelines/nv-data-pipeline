AN ACT relating to public works; revising certain provisions
relating to an alternate writ of mandamus filed by a
contractor on a public work to compel performance of
certain required duties of a public body; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a contractor on a public work who believes the public body
2 has failed to perform certain required duties may apply to the district court of the
3 county in which the public work is located for an alternate writ of mandamus to
4 require the public body to perform the required duty. Existing law also provides
5 that a public body is authorized to include certain provisions governing the
6 payment of attorney’s fees in a contract with a contractor for a public work. (NRS
7 338.630) This bill provides that the court is authorized to award reasonable
8 attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party on an alternate writ of mandamus,
9 regardless of whether there is a provision in the contract governing the payment of
10 such fees and costs.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
