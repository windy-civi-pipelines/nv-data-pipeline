AN ACT relating to public works; [authorizing a court to award attorney’s fees and
costs to a party that prevails on a writ of mandamus to enforce certain
provisions relating to public works; revising certain provisions relating
to an alternate writ of mandamus filed by a contractor on a public work
to compel performance of certain required duties of a public body;]
authorizing an action seeking an alternate writ of mandamus to
require a public body to award certain contracts and authorizing a
court to award attorney’s fees and costs to a party that prevails on
such an alternate writ of mandamus; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures and requirements for contracts for a public
2 work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) [Section 1 of this bill authorizes a court to award reasonable
3 attorney’s fees and costs to a party that prevails on a writ of mandamus filed to enforce the
4 provisions of chapter 338 of NRS.
5 Under existing law, a contractor on a public work who believes the public body has failed
6 to perform certain required duties may apply to the district court of the county in which the
7 public work is located for an alternate writ of mandamus to require the public body to perform
8 the required duty. Existing law also provides that a public body is authorized to include
9 certain provisions governing the payment of attorney’s fees in a contract with a contractor for
10 a public work. (NRS 338.630) Section 1.5 of this bill provides that the court is authorized to
11 award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party on an alternate writ of
12 mandamus, regardless of whether there is a provision in the contract governing the payment of
13 such fees and costs.] Section 2 of this bill authorizes a party found by a court of
14 competent jurisdiction to have legal standing to bring an action in district court against
15 a public body to obtain an alternate writ of mandamus requiring the public body to
16 award a contract pursuant to the provisions of chapter 338 of NRS if: (1) the public
17 body attempts to award certain contracts in compliance with certain provisions of law
18 relating to public procurement; and (2) the work to be performed pursuant to the
19 contract is not directly related to the normal operation of the public body or the normal
20 maintenance of its property. Section 2 also authorizes a district court to award
21 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to a party that prevails on such an alternate writ of
22 mandamus.
