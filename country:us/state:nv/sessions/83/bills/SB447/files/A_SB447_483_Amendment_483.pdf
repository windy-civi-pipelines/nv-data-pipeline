AN ACT relating to public works; authorizing a court to award attorney’s fees
and costs to a party that prevails on a writ of mandamus to enforce
certain provisions relating to public works; revising certain
provisions relating to an alternate writ of mandamus filed by a
contractor on a public work to compel performance of certain required
duties of a public body; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures and requirements for contracts for a
2 public work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a court to award
3 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to a party that prevails on a writ of mandamus filed
4 to enforce the provisions of chapter 338 of NRS.
5 Under existing law, a contractor on a public work who believes the public body has failed
6 to perform certain required duties may apply to the district court of the county in which the
7 public work is located for an alternate writ of mandamus to require the public body to perform
8 the required duty. Existing law also provides that a public body is authorized to include
9 certain provisions governing the payment of attorney’s fees in a contract with a contractor for
10 a public work. (NRS 338.630) [This] Section 1.5 of this bill provides that the court is
11 authorized to award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party on an alternate
12 writ of mandamus, regardless of whether there is a provision in the contract governing the
13 payment of such fees and costs.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 338 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a
2 new section to read as follows:
3 A court may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing
4 party on a writ of mandamus filed in a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
5 the provisions of this chapter.

1 [Section 1.] Sec. 1.5. NRS 338.630 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 338.630 1. A contractor who believes that the public body has failed to
3 perform a duty to:
4 (a) Make a payment;
5 (b) Provide written notice of any withholding; or
6 (c) Provide information upon request relating to any payment with respect to a
7 contract which has not been fully performed,
8  pursuant to one or more of the provisions of NRS 338.515 to 338.535, inclusive,
9 in a timely manner may apply to the district court of the county in which the public
10 work or a part thereof is located for an alternate writ of mandamus pursuant to NRS
11 34.150 to 34.310, inclusive, to require the public body to perform the duty required
12 pursuant to such a provision.
13 2. The provisions of this section do not prevent a public body from including
14 a provision governing the payment of attorney’s fees and costs in a contract into
15 which it enters with a contractor for a public work. The court may award
16 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party on an alternate writ of
17 mandamus filed pursuant to subsection 1, regardless of whether there is a
18 provision in the contract governing the payment of such fees and costs.
