AN ACT relating to public works; authorizing a court to award
attorney’s fees and costs to a party that prevails on a writ
of mandamus to enforce certain provisions relating to
public works; revising certain provisions relating to an
alternate writ of mandamus filed by a contractor on a

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures and requirements for contracts for a
2 public work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a court to
3 award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to a party that prevails on a writ of
4 mandamus filed to enforce the provisions of chapter 338 of NRS.
5 Under existing law, a contractor on a public work who believes the public body
6 has failed to perform certain required duties may apply to the district court of the
7 county in which the public work is located for an alternate writ of mandamus to
8 require the public body to perform the required duty. Existing law also provides
9 that a public body is authorized to include certain provisions governing the
10 payment of attorney’s fees in a contract with a contractor for a public work. (NRS
11 338.630) Section 1.5 of this bill provides that the court is authorized to award
12 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party on an alternate writ of
13 mandamus, regardless of whether there is a provision in the contract governing the
14 payment of such fees and costs.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 338 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 A court may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the
4 prevailing party on a writ of mandamus filed in a court of
5 competent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
6 Sec. 1.5. NRS 338.630 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 338.630 1. A contractor who believes that the public body
8 has failed to perform a duty to:
9 (a) Make a payment;
10 (b) Provide written notice of any withholding; or
11 (c) Provide information upon request relating to any payment
12 with respect to a contract which has not been fully performed,
13  pursuant to one or more of the provisions of NRS 338.515 to
14 338.535, inclusive, in a timely manner may apply to the district
15 court of the county in which the public work or a part thereof is
16 located for an alternate writ of mandamus pursuant to NRS 34.150
17 to 34.310, inclusive, to require the public body to perform the duty
18 required pursuant to such a provision.

22 public work. The court may award reasonable attorney’s fees and
23 costs to the prevailing party on an alternate writ of mandamus

25 provision in the contract governing the payment of such fees and
26 costs.
