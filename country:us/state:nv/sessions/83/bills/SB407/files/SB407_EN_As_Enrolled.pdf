CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to indigent services; revising provisions governing
the Executive Director of the Department of Indigent Defense
Services and the State Public Defender; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Department of Indigent Defense Services and requires
the Governor to appoint the Executive Director of the Department, who serves at
the pleasure of the Governor. (NRS 180.400) Section 25.5 of this bill instead: (1)
requires the Executive Director to serve at the pleasure of the Board on Indigent
Defense Services; and (2) authorizes the Board to remove the Executive Director
only for good cause, unless an exception applies. Section 25.5 also specifies that
the Executive Director serves a term of 4 years and may be reappointed.
Existing law creates the Office of the State Public Defender within the
Department and requires the Governor to appoint the State Public Defender. (NRS
180.010) Section 16 of this bill instead requires the Executive Director to appoint
the State Public Defender. Section 16 also authorizes the Executive Director to
reappoint the State Public Defender.
Existing law requires the Executive Director and the State Public Defender to
be licensed to practice law in this State. (NRS 180.010, 180.400) Sections 16 and
25.5 instead require each such person to be a member of the State Bar of Nevada or
otherwise authorized to practice law in this State under the rules of the Supreme
Court.
Section 25.7 of this bill authorizes the person serving as the State Public
Defender on the effective date of this bill to serve the remainder of the term for
which he or she was appointed. Section 25.7 also provides that the person serving
as the Executive Director on the effective date of this bill is deemed to have been
appointed to a term of 4 years beginning on that date.
