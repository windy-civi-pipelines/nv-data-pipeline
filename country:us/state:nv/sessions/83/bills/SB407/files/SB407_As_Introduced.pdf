4 duties of the State Public Defender. (NRS 180.010-180.080) Section 3 of this bill
5 creates the Office of Alternate State Public Defender within the Department to
6 counsel and defend indigent persons under certain circumstances, including,
7 without limitation, if the county public defender or State Public Defender is
8 disqualified or otherwise unable to provide representation. Section 9 of this bill

– 2 –
15 authorizes the State Public Defender to enter into a contract with the Alternate State
16 Public Defender or Postconviction Counsel to provide representation for indigent
17 persons under certain circumstances; and (2) provides that all such services must be
18 performed under the supervision and control of the State Public Defender.
19 Existing law requires the Board on Indigent Defense Services and the
20 Department to perform certain duties related to the oversight of indigent defense
21 services in this State. (NRS 180.320, 180.400, 180.410, 180.430) Section 19 of this

25 the Department to perform certain duties relating to the oversight of postconviction
26 services in this State. Section 24 of this bill provides that the privilege for
27 confidential communication between a client and the client’s attorney is not waived
28 if a disclosure is made to the Department or its designee for the purpose of
29 submitting a complaint against an attorney providing postconviction services.
30 Sections 2 and 15 of this bill define the term “postconviction services” for the
31 purposes of this bill and certain other provisions of existing law governing the
32 provision of legal representation to indigent persons.
