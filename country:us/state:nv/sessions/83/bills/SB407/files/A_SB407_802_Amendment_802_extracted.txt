provisions governing the Executive Director of the Department of
Indigent Defense Services [; prescribing the qualifications, powers]
and [duties of] the [Alternate] State Public Defender ; [and
Postconviction Counsel; revising certain qualifications of members of
the Board on Indigent Defense Services; revising the duties of the
Board, Department and certain employees of the Department;] and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates [the Office of State Public Defender within] the Department of
2 Indigent Defense Services [to counsel and defend certain indigent persons. (NRS 180.010,
3 180.060) Existing law further prescribes the qualifications, powers and duties of the State
4 Public Defender. (NRS 180.010-180.080) Section 3 of this bill creates the Office of Alternate
5 State Public Defender within the Department to counsel and defend indigent persons under
6 certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if the county public defender or State
7 Public Defender is disqualified or otherwise unable to provide representation. Section 9 of this
8 bill likewise creates the Office of Postconviction Counsel within the Department to prosecute
9 appeals and other postconviction remedies on behalf of indigent persons under certain
10 circumstances. Sections 4-8 and 10-14 of this bill prescribe the qualifications, powers and
11 duties of the Alternate State Public Defender and the Postconviction Counsel, respectively,
12 and make various other changes relating to the provision of legal services by each such
13 officer. Section 18 of this bill: (1) authorizes the State Public Defender to enter into a contract
14 with the Alternate State Public Defender or Postconviction Counsel to provide representation
15 for indigent persons under certain circumstances; and (2) provides that all such services must
16 be performed under the supervision and control of the State Public Defender.
17 Existing law requires the Board on Indigent Defense Services and the Department to
18 perform certain duties related to the oversight of indigent defense services in this State. (NRS
19 180.320, 180.400, 180.410, 180.430) Section 19 of this bill revises certain qualifications of
Senate Amendment No. 802 to Senate Bill No. 407 Page 4
20 the members of the Board. Sections 20-23 of this bill revise the duties of the Board,
21 Department and certain employees of the Department to additionally require the Board,
22 Department and certain employees of the Department to perform certain duties relating to the
23 oversight of postconviction services in this State. Section 24 of this bill provides that the
24 privilege for confidential communication between a client and the client’s attorney is not
25 waived if a disclosure is made to the Department or its designee for the purpose of submitting
26 a complaint against an attorney providing postconviction services. Sections 2 and 15 of this
27 bill define the term “postconviction services” for the purposes of this bill and certain other
28 provisions of existing law governing the provision of legal representation to indigent persons.
29 Existing law generally prohibits the State Public Defender and any deputy state public
30 defender employed in the Office of State Public Defender from engaging in the private
31 practice of law. (NRS 180.010, 180.030) Sections 16 and 17 of this bill remove this
32 prohibition, thereby authorizing the State Public Defender and any deputy state public
33 defender to engage in the private practice of law.] and requires the Governor to appoint the
34 Executive Director of the Department, who serves at the pleasure of the Governor. (NRS
35 180.400) Section 25.5 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Executive Director to serve at
36 the pleasure of the Board on Indigent Defense Services; and (2) authorizes the Board to
37 remove the Executive Director only for good cause, unless an exception applies. Section
38 25.5 also specifies that the Executive Director serves a term of 4 years and may be
39 reappointed.
40 Existing law creates the Office of the State Public Defender within the Department
41 and requires the Governor to appoint the State Public Defender. (NRS 180.010) Section
42 16 of this bill instead requires the Executive Director to appoint the State Public
43 Defender. Section 16 also authorizes the Executive Director to reappoint the State Public
44 Defender.
45 Existing law requires the Executive Director and the State Public Defender to be
46 licensed to practice law in this State. (NRS 180.010, 180.400) Sections 16 and 25.5 instead
47 require each such person to be a member of the State Bar of Nevada or otherwise
48 authorized to practice law in this State under the rules of the Supreme Court.
49 Section 25.7 of this bill authorizes the person serving as the State Public Defender on
50 the effective date of this bill to serve the remainder of the term for which he or she was
51 appointed. Section 25.7 also provides that the person serving as the Executive Director
52 on the effective date of this bill is deemed to have been appointed to a term of 4 years
53 beginning on that date.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to [legal representation for indigent
persons.] the Department of Indigent Defense Services.
(BDR 14-492)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to indigent services; [creating the Office of Alternate State Public
Defender and the Office of Postconviction Counsel within] revising
provisions governing the Executive Director of the Department of
Indigent Defense Services [; prescribing the qualifications, powers]
and [duties of] the [Alternate] State Public Defender ; [and
Postconviction Counsel; revising certain qualifications of members of
the Board on Indigent Defense Services; revising the duties of the
Board, Department and certain employees of the Department;] and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates [the Office of State Public Defender within] the Department of
2 Indigent Defense Services [to counsel and defend certain indigent persons. (NRS 180.010,
3 180.060) Existing law further prescribes the qualifications, powers and duties of the State
4 Public Defender. (NRS 180.010-180.080) Section 3 of this bill creates the Office of Alternate
5 State Public Defender within the Department to counsel and defend indigent persons under
6 certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if the county public defender or State
7 Public Defender is disqualified or otherwise unable to provide representation. Section 9 of this
8 bill likewise creates the Office of Postconviction Counsel within the Department to prosecute
9 appeals and other postconviction remedies on behalf of indigent persons under certain
10 circumstances. Sections 4-8 and 10-14 of this bill prescribe the qualifications, powers and
11 duties of the Alternate State Public Defender and the Postconviction Counsel, respectively,
12 and make various other changes relating to the provision of legal services by each such
13 officer. Section 18 of this bill: (1) authorizes the State Public Defender to enter into a contract
14 with the Alternate State Public Defender or Postconviction Counsel to provide representation
15 for indigent persons under certain circumstances; and (2) provides that all such services must
16 be performed under the supervision and control of the State Public Defender.
17 Existing law requires the Board on Indigent Defense Services and the Department to
18 perform certain duties related to the oversight of indigent defense services in this State. (NRS
19 180.320, 180.400, 180.410, 180.430) Section 19 of this bill revises certain qualifications of

Senate Amendment No. 802 to Senate Bill No. 407 Page 4
20 the members of the Board. Sections 20-23 of this bill revise the duties of the Board,
21 Department and certain employees of the Department to additionally require the Board,
22 Department and certain employees of the Department to perform certain duties relating to the
23 oversight of postconviction services in this State. Section 24 of this bill provides that the
24 privilege for confidential communication between a client and the client’s attorney is not
25 waived if a disclosure is made to the Department or its designee for the purpose of submitting
26 a complaint against an attorney providing postconviction services. Sections 2 and 15 of this
27 bill define the term “postconviction services” for the purposes of this bill and certain other
28 provisions of existing law governing the provision of legal representation to indigent persons.
29 Existing law generally prohibits the State Public Defender and any deputy state public
30 defender employed in the Office of State Public Defender from engaging in the private
31 practice of law. (NRS 180.010, 180.030) Sections 16 and 17 of this bill remove this
32 prohibition, thereby authorizing the State Public Defender and any deputy state public
33 defender to engage in the private practice of law.] and requires the Governor to appoint the
34 Executive Director of the Department, who serves at the pleasure of the Governor. (NRS
35 180.400) Section 25.5 of this bill instead: (1) requires the Executive Director to serve at
36 the pleasure of the Board on Indigent Defense Services; and (2) authorizes the Board to
37 remove the Executive Director only for good cause, unless an exception applies. Section
38 25.5 also specifies that the Executive Director serves a term of 4 years and may be
39 reappointed.
40 Existing law creates the Office of the State Public Defender within the Department
41 and requires the Governor to appoint the State Public Defender. (NRS 180.010) Section
42 16 of this bill instead requires the Executive Director to appoint the State Public
43 Defender. Section 16 also authorizes the Executive Director to reappoint the State Public
44 Defender.
45 Existing law requires the Executive Director and the State Public Defender to be
46 licensed to practice law in this State. (NRS 180.010, 180.400) Sections 16 and 25.5 instead
47 require each such person to be a member of the State Bar of Nevada or otherwise
48 authorized to practice law in this State under the rules of the Supreme Court.
49 Section 25.7 of this bill authorizes the person serving as the State Public Defender on
50 the effective date of this bill to serve the remainder of the term for which he or she was
51 appointed. Section 25.7 also provides that the person serving as the Executive Director
52 on the effective date of this bill is deemed to have been appointed to a term of 4 years
53 beginning on that date.
