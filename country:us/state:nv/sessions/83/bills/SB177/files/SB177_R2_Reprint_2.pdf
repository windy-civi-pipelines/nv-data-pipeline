~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a
homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care to a temporary
alternative placement under certain circumstances;
revising the requirement for the principal of a school to
consult with certain persons before determining that a
homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care is a habitual
disciplinary problem; revising the procedure for the
suspension of homeless pupils or pupils in foster care and
the procedure for determining whether homelessness or
placement in foster care is a factor in the behavior of
certain pupils; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine
2 that a pupil who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual
3 disciplinary problem. (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11
4 years of age or older is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem and the school has
5 made a reasonable effort to complete a plan of action based on restorative justice
6 with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to suspend the pupil, or under
7 extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school. (NRS 392.466)
8 Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care may be
9 determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
10 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the principal
11 to conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons.
12 Section 1.5 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to
-
*SB177_R2*

– 2 –
13 additionally include the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a
14 court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
15 Existing law requires that, to suspend from school a pupil who is homeless or
16 has been placed in foster care for not more than 5 days, a determination must be
17 made, after consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster
18 care was not a factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person
19 responsible for making such a determination is required to presume that
20 homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior and make the
21 determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS 392.466, 392.467)
22 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize a principal to suspend a homeless pupil or a
23 pupil in foster care for 5 days or less without consideration of whether being
24 homeless or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil and to
25 consider such factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. As soon as
26 practicable and not later than the 10th school day after the pupil is suspended,
27 sections 2 and 3 require the principal to consider whether the behavior was caused
28 by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being
29 homeless during a meeting with certain persons who have an interest in the
30 education of the pupil. If during such a meeting it is determined that the conduct
31 was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or
32 being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the principal to either: (1)
33 end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with behavioral and academic
34 support; or (2) assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for not more
35 than 45 school days if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or the behavior
36 that led to the suspension consisted of, while at school or a school activity,
37 possessing a dangerous weapon or firearm, engaging in certain actions relating to
38 controlled substances or committing a battery intended to cause bodily injury.
39 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to continue the temporary
40 alternative placement of such a pupil for more than 45 days if the principal
41 determines that the continued temporary placement is necessary for the safety of
42 the pupil or others. Section 1 requires the principal to make such a determination
43 after holding a meeting with the local educational agency liaison for homeless
44 pupils or educational decision maker of the pupil and a contact person at the school.
45 If the principal makes such a determination, section 1 additionally requires the
46 principal to provide targeted intervention to the pupil and notify the educational
47 decision maker appointed for the pupil concerning the right to an evaluation to
48 determine if the pupil is eligible for special education and related services.
49 Additionally, section 1 requires the principal to hold a meeting to create a plan for
50 the transition of the pupil from the temporary alternative placement if the pupil is
51 assigned to a temporary alternative placement for more than 21 days.
52 Sections 1.5-3 additionally require that the school have been given notice that
53 the pupil is homeless or in foster care before the school is required to perform the
54 tasks set forth in those sections.

20 cumulative days.
21 7. If a school is unable to retain a pupil in the school pursuant
22 to subsections 1 to 6, inclusive, for the safety of any person or
23 because doing so would not be in the best interest of the pupil, the
24 pupil may be suspended, expelled or placed in another school. If a
25 pupil, including, without limitation, a pupil who is less than 11 years
26 of age, is placed in another school, the current school of the pupil
27 shall explain what services will be provided to the pupil at the new
28 school that the current school is unable to provide to address the

4 to NRS 389.155 for pupils who have been suspended or expelled
5 from public school or a program of distance education provided

8 requirements of the applicable program; or
9 (c) Enroll in a program of alternative education provided by the
10 school district in which the pupil resides. Each school district shall,

19 in a particular case in that school district or public school, as
20 applicable, allow a modification to a suspension or expulsion

22 forth in writing. The superintendent or the administrative head of a
23 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as
24 applicable, shall allow such a modification if he or she determines
25 that a plan of action based on restorative justice may be used
26 successfully.
27 11. This section does not prohibit a pupil from having in his or
28 her possession a knife or firearm with the approval of the principal
29 of the school. A principal may grant such approval only in
30 accordance with the policies or regulations adopted by the board of
31 trustees of the school district or the governing body of the charter
32 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as
33 applicable.
34 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5 or 6, a pupil
35 with a disability who is at least 11 years of age may, in accordance
36 with the procedural policy adopted by the board of trustees of the
37 school district or the governing body of the charter school or
38 university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, for
39 such matters and only after the board of trustees of the school
40 district or governing body, as applicable, or its designee has
41 reviewed the circumstances and determined that the action is in
42 compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
43 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq., be:

9 educational decision maker has been appointed for the pupil
10 pursuant to NRS 432B.462, a meeting with the educational
11 decision maker for the pupil, the principal determines that the
12 conduct of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other
13 persons at the school and if a determination is made that
14 homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
15 that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The
16 person responsible for making a determination of whether or not
17 homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
18 shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
19 factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise
20 pursuant to this subsection. A determination that homelessness was
21 not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation with the
22 local educational agency liaison for homeless pupils designated in
23 accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of
24 1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school,

26 worker. A determination that being in foster care was not a factor in
27 the behavior must be made in consultation with an advocate for
28 pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled or
29 the school counselor of the pupil.]
30 14. As soon as possible and not later than the 10th school day
31 after the pupil was suspended from school pursuant to subsection
32 13, the principal shall review all relevant information to consider
33 whether the behavior which led to the suspension was caused by
34 or had a direct and substantial relationship to the pupil being in
35 foster care or being homeless in a meeting with the educational
36 decision maker for the pupil or surrogate parent, if one has been
37 appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.462 or 34 C.F.R. § 300.519, as
38 applicable, an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school and
39 any other person the principal determines necessary. The relevant
40 information to be reviewed during the meeting must include,
41 without limitation:
42 (a) The pupil’s cumulative record;
43 (b) The pupil’s academic plan, if one exists;
44 (c) Observations by staff of the conduct leading to suspension
45 and the pupil generally; and
-
*SB177_R2*

– 15 –
1 (d) Any other information provided by a person at the meeting.
2 15. If during the meeting held pursuant to subsection 14, the
3 principal determines that the behavior leading to suspension was
4 caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in
5 foster care or being homeless, the principal shall:
6 (a) Eliminate the period of suspension and provide the pupil
7 with behavioral and academic support, including, without
8 limitation, the development of or revisions to an academic plan; or
9 (b) Assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for
10 not more than 45 school days pursuant to NRS 392.4645, if the
11 pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem pursuant to NRS 392.4655
12 or the behavior that led to the suspension consisted of, while on
13 the premises of any public school, at an activity sponsored by a
14 public school or on any school bus:
15 (1) Possessing a dangerous weapon or firearm;
16 (2) Knowingly possessing, using, selling, distributing or
17 soliciting for sale a controlled substance; or
18 (3) Committing a battery with the intent to cause bodily
19 injury.
20 16. If the principal provides three written notices on 3
21 separate days requesting a person attend a meeting required by
22 subsection 13 or 14 and does not receive a response from the
23 person within 24 hours after sending the third notice, the principal
24 may hold the meeting without that person.
25 17. The principal of a public school may, at his or her
26 discretion, reduce or eliminate the period of suspension, convert an
27 expulsion to a suspension or otherwise reduce, eliminate or alter a
28 disciplinary action imposed upon a pupil who commits a battery
29 which results in the bodily injury of an employee of the school.
30 [15.] 18. The principal of a public school may reduce the
31 period of suspension or convert an expulsion to a suspension for a
32 pupil who distributes a controlled substance while on the premises
33 of a public school, at an activity sponsored by a public school or on
34 a school bus if:
35 (a) The pupil is less than 11 years of age;
36 (b) The pupil has not engaged in such proscribed conduct
37 before; and
38 (c) After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances, the
39 principal determines that the pupil did not know that the substance
40 being distributed was a controlled substance.
41 [16.] 19. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS do not apply
42 to any hearing or proceeding conducted pursuant to this section.
43 Such hearings or proceedings must be closed to the public.
