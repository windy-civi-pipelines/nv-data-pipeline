EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a homeless pupil or
a pupil in foster care to a temporary alternative placement under certain
circumstances; revising the requirement for the principal of a school to
consult with certain persons before determining that a homeless pupil
or a pupil in foster care is a habitual disciplinary problem; revising the
procedure for the suspension of homeless pupils or pupils in foster care
and the procedure for determining whether homelessness or placement
in foster care is a factor in the behavior of certain pupils; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine that a pupil
2 who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual disciplinary problem.
3 (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11 years of age or older is deemed a
4 habitual disciplinary problem and the school has made a reasonable effort to complete a plan
5 of action based on restorative justice with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to
6 suspend the pupil, or under extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school.
7 (NRS 392.466) Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care
8 may be determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
9 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the principal to conduct
10 a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons. Section 1.5 also requires
11 such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to additionally include the educational
12 decision maker appointed for the pupil by a court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
13 Existing law requires that, to suspend from school a pupil who is homeless or has been
14 placed in foster care for not more than 5 days, a determination must be made, after
15 consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in
16 the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person responsible for making such a
17 determination is required to presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor
18 in the behavior and make the determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS
19 392.466, 392.467) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize a principal to suspend a homeless
20 pupil or a pupil in foster care for 5 days or less without consideration of whether being
21 homeless or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil and to consider such
22 factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. [On the 6th school day of a] As
Assembly Amendment No. 618 to Senate Bill No. 177 First Reprint Page 4
23 soon as practicable and not later than the 10th school day after the pupil [being] is
24 suspended, sections 2 and 3 require the principal to consider whether the behavior was caused
25 by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being homeless during a
26 meeting with certain persons who have an interest in the education of the pupil. If during such
27 a meeting it is determined that the conduct was caused by or had a substantial relationship to
28 the pupil being in foster care or being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the
29 principal to [end] either: (1) end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with
30 behavioral and academic support [.
31 Existing law authorizes the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom or other
32 premises of a public school under certain circumstances. Existing law prohibits a principal
33 from temporarily removing a pupil if the pupil is required to be suspended. (NRS 392.4645)] ;
34 or (2) assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for not more than 45 school
35 days if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or the behavior that led to the
36 suspension consisted of, while at school or a school activity, possessing a dangerous
37 weapon or firearm, engaging in certain actions relating to controlled substances or
38 committing a battery intended to cause bodily injury.
39 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to [temporarily remove a homeless pupil or a
40 pupil in foster care] continue the temporary alternative placement of such a pupil for [not]
41 more than 45 days if the [pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or at school or a school
42 activity possesses a dangerous weapon or firearm, engages in certain actions relating to
43 controlled substances or commits a battery intended to cause bodily injury. If such a pupil is
44 temporarily removed, section 1 additionally requires the] principal [to then review all relevant
45 information to determine whether the behavior was caused by or substantially related to the
46 pupil being homeless or in foster care.] determines that the continued temporary
47 placement is necessary for the safety of the pupil or others. Section 1 requires the
48 principal to make such a determination after holding a meeting with the local
49 educational agency liaison for homeless pupils or educational decision maker of the
50 pupil and a contact person at the school. If the principal makes such a determination,
51 section 1 additionally requires the principal to [hold a meeting with certain persons interested
52 in the education of the pupil to review the pupil’s academic plan for application to the
53 temporary removal and make revisions to the plan.] provide targeted intervention to the
54 pupil and notify the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil concerning the
55 right to an evaluation to determine if the pupil is eligible for special education and
56 related services. Additionally, section 1 requires the principal to hold a meeting to create
57 a plan for the transition of the pupil from the temporary alternative placement if the
58 pupil is assigned to a temporary alternative placement for more than 21 days.
59 Sections 1.5-3 additionally require that the school have been given notice that the
60 pupil is homeless or in foster care before the school is required to perform the tasks set
61 forth in those sections.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a homeless pupil or
a pupil in foster care to a temporary alternative placement under certain
circumstances; revising the requirement for the principal of a school to
consult with certain persons before determining that a homeless pupil
or a pupil in foster care is a habitual disciplinary problem; revising the
procedure for the suspension of homeless pupils or pupils in foster care
and the procedure for determining whether homelessness or placement
in foster care is a factor in the behavior of certain pupils; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine that a pupil
2 who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual disciplinary problem.
3 (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11 years of age or older is deemed a
4 habitual disciplinary problem and the school has made a reasonable effort to complete a plan
5 of action based on restorative justice with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to
6 suspend the pupil, or under extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school.
7 (NRS 392.466) Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care
8 may be determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
9 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the principal to conduct
10 a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons. Section 1.5 also requires
11 such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to additionally include the educational
12 decision maker appointed for the pupil by a court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
13 Existing law requires that, to suspend from school a pupil who is homeless or has been
14 placed in foster care for not more than 5 days, a determination must be made, after
15 consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in
16 the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person responsible for making such a
17 determination is required to presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor
18 in the behavior and make the determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS
19 392.466, 392.467) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize a principal to suspend a homeless
20 pupil or a pupil in foster care for 5 days or less without consideration of whether being
21 homeless or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil and to consider such
22 factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. [On the 6th school day of a] As

Assembly Amendment No. 618 to Senate Bill No. 177 First Reprint Page 4
23 soon as practicable and not later than the 10th school day after the pupil [being] is
24 suspended, sections 2 and 3 require the principal to consider whether the behavior was caused
25 by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being homeless during a
26 meeting with certain persons who have an interest in the education of the pupil. If during such
27 a meeting it is determined that the conduct was caused by or had a substantial relationship to
28 the pupil being in foster care or being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the
29 principal to [end] either: (1) end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with
30 behavioral and academic support [.
31 Existing law authorizes the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom or other
32 premises of a public school under certain circumstances. Existing law prohibits a principal
33 from temporarily removing a pupil if the pupil is required to be suspended. (NRS 392.4645)] ;
34 or (2) assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for not more than 45 school
35 days if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or the behavior that led to the
36 suspension consisted of, while at school or a school activity, possessing a dangerous
37 weapon or firearm, engaging in certain actions relating to controlled substances or
38 committing a battery intended to cause bodily injury.
39 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to [temporarily remove a homeless pupil or a
40 pupil in foster care] continue the temporary alternative placement of such a pupil for [not]
41 more than 45 days if the [pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or at school or a school
42 activity possesses a dangerous weapon or firearm, engages in certain actions relating to
43 controlled substances or commits a battery intended to cause bodily injury. If such a pupil is
44 temporarily removed, section 1 additionally requires the] principal [to then review all relevant
45 information to determine whether the behavior was caused by or substantially related to the
46 pupil being homeless or in foster care.] determines that the continued temporary
47 placement is necessary for the safety of the pupil or others. Section 1 requires the
48 principal to make such a determination after holding a meeting with the local
49 educational agency liaison for homeless pupils or educational decision maker of the
50 pupil and a contact person at the school. If the principal makes such a determination,
51 section 1 additionally requires the principal to [hold a meeting with certain persons interested
52 in the education of the pupil to review the pupil’s academic plan for application to the
53 temporary removal and make revisions to the plan.] provide targeted intervention to the
54 pupil and notify the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil concerning the
55 right to an evaluation to determine if the pupil is eligible for special education and
56 related services. Additionally, section 1 requires the principal to hold a meeting to create
57 a plan for the transition of the pupil from the temporary alternative placement if the
58 pupil is assigned to a temporary alternative placement for more than 21 days.
59 Sections 1.5-3 additionally require that the school have been given notice that the
60 pupil is homeless or in foster care before the school is required to perform the tasks set
61 forth in those sections.

35 less than 11 years of age must not be expelled or permanently expelled from school.
36 In extraordinary circumstances, a school may request an exception to the
37 prohibition set forth in this subsection against expelling or permanently expelling a
38 pupil who is less than 11 years of age from school from the board of trustees of the
39 school district or the governing body of the charter school or university school, as

46 a pupil who:
47 (a) Poses a continuing danger to persons or property;
48 (b) Is an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process;

Assembly Amendment No. 618 to Senate Bill No. 177 First Reprint Page 16
1  may be removed from the school immediately upon being given an explanation
2 of the reasons for his or her removal and pending proceedings, to be conducted as
3 soon as practicable after removal, for the pupil’s suspension or expulsion.
4 4. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS do not apply to any hearing or
5 proceeding conducted pursuant to this section. Such hearings or proceedings must
6 be closed to the public.
7 5. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter
8 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, or its
9 designee shall not authorize the expulsion, suspension or removal of any pupil from
10 the public school system solely for offenses related to attendance or because the
11 pupil is declared a truant or habitual truant in accordance with NRS 392.130 or
12 392.140.
13 6. A pupil with a disability may, in accordance with the procedural policy
14 adopted by the board of trustees of the school district or the governing body of the
15 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, for
16 such matters and only after an administrative review of the circumstances and a
17 determination that the action is in compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities
18 Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq., be:
19 (a) Suspended from school pursuant to this section for not more than 10 days
20 for each occurrence of proscribed conduct.
21 (b) Expelled from school pursuant to this section.
22 (c) Permanently expelled from school pursuant to this section.
23 7. [A] If the school is on notice that a pupil is homeless or in foster care, a
24 homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care may be suspended from school pursuant to
25 this section for [not] more than 5 days if, following a review of all available
26 information [,] and, if an educational decision maker has been appointed for the
27 pupil pursuant to NRS 432B.462, a meeting with the educational decision maker
28 for the pupil, the principal determines that the conduct of the pupil poses an
29 ongoing threat to the pupil or other persons at the school and if a determination is
30 made that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior that
31 led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The person responsible for
32 making a determination of whether or not homelessness or being in foster care was
33 a factor in the behavior shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was
34 not a factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise pursuant to this
35 subsection. A determination that homelessness was not a factor in the behavior
36 must be made in consultation with the local educational agency liaison for homeless
37 pupils designated in accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance
38 Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school, including,
39 without limitation, a school counselor or school social worker. A determination that
40 being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation
41 with an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled
42 or the school counselor of the pupil.]
43 8. [On the 6th school day] As soon as practicable and not later than the
44 10th school day after the pupil was suspended from school pursuant to subsection
45 7, the principal shall review all relevant information to consider whether the
46 behavior which led to the suspension was caused by or had a direct and
47 substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being homeless in a
48 meeting with the educational decision maker for the pupil or surrogate parent, if
49 one has been appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.462 or 34 C.F.R. § 300.519, as
50 applicable, an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school and any other
51 person the principal determines necessary. The relevant information to be
52 reviewed during the meeting must include, without limitation:
53 (a) The pupil’s cumulative record;

Assembly Amendment No. 618 to Senate Bill No. 177 First Reprint Page 17
1 (b) The pupil’s academic plan, if one exists;
2 (c) Observations by staff of the conduct leading to suspension and the pupil
3 generally; and
4 (d) Any other information provided by a person at the meeting.
5 9. If during the meeting held pursuant to subsection 8, the principal
6 determines that the behavior leading to suspension was caused by or had a
7 substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being homeless, the
8 principal shall:
9 (a) Eliminate the period of suspension [;] and
10 [(b) Provide] provide the pupil with behavioral and academic support,
11 including, without limitation, the development of or revisions to an academic
12 plan [.] ; or
13 (b) Assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for not more than
14 45 school days pursuant to NRS 392.4645, if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary
15 problem pursuant to NRS 392.4655 or the behavior that led to the suspension
16 consisted of, while on the premises of any public school, at an activity sponsored
17 by a public school or on any school bus:
18 (1) Possessing a dangerous weapon or firearm;
19 (2) Knowingly possessing, using, selling, distributing or soliciting for
20 sale a controlled substance; or
21 (3) Committing a battery with intend to cause bodily injury.
22 10. If the principal provides three written notices on 3 separate days
23 requesting a person attend a meeting required by subsection 7 or 8 and does not
24 receive a response from the person, the principal may hold the meeting without
25 that person.
26 11. As used in this section:
27 (a) “Battery” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 392.466.
28 (b) “Bodily injury” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 392.466.
29 (c) “Dangerous weapon” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 392.466.
