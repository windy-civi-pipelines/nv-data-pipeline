EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising the requirement for the
principal of a school to consult with certain persons
before determining that a homeless pupil or pupil in foster
care is a habitual disciplinary problem or suspending or
expelling such a pupil; revising certain presumptions used
when determining whether homelessness or placement in
foster care is a factor in the behavior of certain pupils; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine
2 that a pupil who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual
3 disciplinary problem. (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11
4 years of age or older is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem and the school has
5 made a reasonable effort to complete a plan of action based on restorative justice
6 with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to suspend the pupil, or under
7 extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school. (NRS 392.466)
8 Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care may be
9 determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
10 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1 of this bill requires the principal to
11 conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons.
12 Section 1 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to
13 additionally include the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a
14 court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
15 Existing law requires that, to suspend or expel from school a pupil who is
16 homeless or has been placed in foster care, a determination must be made, after
17 consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster care was not
18 a factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person responsible for
19 making such a determination is required to presume that homelessness or being in
20 foster care was not a factor in the behavior and make the determination in
-
*SB177*

– 2 –
21 consultation with certain persons. (NRS 392.466, 392.467) Sections 2 and 3 of this
22 bill change the presumption used to determine whether homeless or being in foster
23 care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil by requiring the person responsible for
24 making the determination to presume that homelessness or being in foster care was
25 a factor in the behavior. Sections 2 and 3 also require: (1) the person making the
26 determining to conduct a meeting with certain persons rather than consult with
27 those persons; and (2) such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to
28 additionally include the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a
29 court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 392.4655 is hereby amended to read as

12 behavior pursuant to subsection 5 and the pupil has not made efforts
13 to enter into or participate in such a plan of behavior;
14 (c) The homelessness of the pupil was not a factor in his or her
15 behavior, as determined [in consultation] after conducting a
16 meeting with the local educational agency liaison for homeless
17 pupils designated in accordance with the McKinney-Vento
18 Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a
19 contact person at a school, including, without limitation, a school
20 counselor or school social worker; and
21 (d) The placement in foster care of the pupil was not a factor in

17 (b) An explanation that if the pupil receives five significant
18 suspensions on his or her record during the current school year and

21 problem;
22 (c) An explanation that, pursuant to subsection 8 of NRS
23 392.466, a pupil who is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem may

30 limitation, that if it is determined in accordance with 20 U.S.C. §
31 1415 that the pupil’s behavior is not a manifestation of the pupil’s
32 disability, he or she may be suspended or expelled from school in
33 the same manner as a pupil without a disability; and
34 (e) A summary of the provisions of subsection 5.
35 4. A school shall provide the notice required by subsection 3
36 for each suspension on the record of a pupil during a school year.
37 Such notice must be provided at least 7 days before the school
38 deems the pupil a habitual disciplinary problem.
39 5. If a pupil, including, without limitation, a pupil who is less
40 than 11 years of age, is suspended, the school in which the pupil is
41 enrolled shall develop, in consultation with the pupil and the parent
42 or legal guardian of the pupil, a plan of behavior for the pupil. The
43 parent or legal guardian of the pupil or, if the pupil is an
44 unaccompanied pupil, the pupil may choose for the pupil not to
45 participate in the plan of behavior. If the parent or legal guardian of
-
*SB177*

1 the pupil or the pupil chooses for the pupil not to participate, the
2 school shall inform the parent or legal guardian or the pupil of the
3 consequences of not participating in the plan of behavior. Such a

5 habitual disciplinary problem and may include, without limitation:

24 school district.
25 6. If a pupil commits the same act for which notice was
26 provided pursuant to subsection 3 after he or she enters into a plan
27 of behavior pursuant to subsection 5, the pupil shall be deemed to
28 have not successfully completed the plan of behavior and may be
29 deemed a habitual disciplinary problem.
30 7. A pupil may, pursuant to the provisions of this section, enter
31 into one plan of behavior per school year.

33 unaccompanied pupil, a pupil who has entered into a plan of
34 behavior with a school pursuant to this section may appeal to the

10 homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
11 shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was [not] a
12 factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise
13 pursuant to this subsection. A determination that homelessness was

21 consultation] after conducting a meeting with an advocate for
22 pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled or
23 the school counselor of the pupil [.] and, if an educational decision
24 maker has been appointed for the pupil pursuant to NRS

32 suspension or convert an expulsion to a suspension for a pupil who

37 (b) The pupil has not engaged in such proscribed conduct
38 before; and
39 (c) After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances, the

13 conduct of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other
14 persons at the school and if a determination is made that
15 homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
16 that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. The person
17 responsible for making a determination of whether or not
18 homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
19 shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was [not] a
20 factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise

26 contact person at a school, including, without limitation, a school
27 counselor or school social worker. A determination that being in
28 foster care was not a factor in the behavior must be made [in
29 consultation] after conducting a meeting with an advocate for
30 pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled or
31 the school counselor of the pupil [.] and, if an educational decision
32 maker has been appointed for the pupil pursuant to NRS
33 432B.462, the educational decision maker for the pupil.
