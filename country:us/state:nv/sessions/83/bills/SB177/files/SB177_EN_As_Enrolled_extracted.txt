Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a
homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care to a temporary
alternative placement under certain circumstances; revising
the requirement for the principal of a school to consult with
certain persons before determining that a homeless pupil or a
pupil in foster care is a habitual disciplinary problem;
revising the procedure for the suspension of homeless pupils
or pupils in foster care and the procedure for determining
whether homelessness or placement in foster care is a factor
in the behavior of certain pupils; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine
that a pupil who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual
disciplinary problem. (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11
years of age or older is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem and the school has
made a reasonable effort to complete a plan of action based on restorative justice
with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to suspend the pupil, or under
extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school. (NRS 392.466)
Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care may be
determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the principal
to conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons.

Section 2:
Section 1.5 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to
additionally include the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a
court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
Existing law requires that, to suspend from school a pupil who is homeless or
has been placed in foster care for not more than 5 days, a determination must be
made, after consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster
care was not a factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person
responsible for making such a determination is required to presume that
homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior and make the
determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS 392.466, 392.467)

Section 3:
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize a principal to suspend a homeless pupil or a
pupil in foster care for 5 days or less without consideration of whether being
homeless or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil and to
consider such factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. As soon as
practicable and not later than the 10th school day after the pupil is suspended,

Section 4:
sections 2 and 3 require the principal to consider whether the behavior was caused
by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being
homeless during a meeting with certain persons who have an interest in the
education of the pupil. If during such a meeting it is determined that the conduct
was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or
being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the principal to either: (1)
end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with behavioral and academic
support; or (2) assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for not more
than 45 school days if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or the behavior

that led to the suspension consisted of, while at school or a school activity,
possessing a dangerous weapon or firearm, engaging in certain actions relating to
controlled substances or committing a battery intended to cause bodily injury.

Section 5:
Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to continue the temporary
alternative placement of such a pupil for more than 45 days if the principal
determines that the continued temporary placement is necessary for the safety of
the pupil or others. Section 1 requires the principal to make such a determination
after holding a meeting with the local educational agency liaison for homeless
pupils or educational decision maker of the pupil and a contact person at the school.
If the principal makes such a determination, section 1 additionally requires the
principal to provide targeted intervention to the pupil and notify the educational
decision maker appointed for the pupil concerning the right to an evaluation to
determine if the pupil is eligible for special education and related services.
Additionally, section 1 requires the principal to hold a meeting to create a plan for
the transition of the pupil from the temporary alternative placement if the pupil is
assigned to a temporary alternative placement for more than 21 days.

Section 6:
Sections 1.5-3 additionally require that the school have been given notice that
the pupil is homeless or in foster care before the school is required to perform the
tasks set forth in those sections.

days if, following a review of all available information [,] and, if an
educational decision maker has been appointed for the pupil
pursuant to NRS 432B.462, a meeting with the educational
decision maker for the pupil, the principal determines that the
conduct of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other
persons at the school and if a determination is made that
homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The
person responsible for making a determination of whether or not
homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise
pursuant to this subsection. A determination that homelessness was
not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation with the
local educational agency liaison for homeless pupils designated in
accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of
1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school,
including, without limitation, a school counselor or school social
worker. A determination that being in foster care was not a factor in
the behavior must be made in consultation with an advocate for
pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled or

foster care or being homeless in a meeting with the educational
decision maker for the pupil or surrogate parent, if one has been
appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.462 or 34 C.F.R. § 300.519, as
applicable, an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school and
any other person the principal determines necessary. The relevant

with behavioral and academic support, including, without
limitation, the development of or revisions to an academic plan; or
(b) Assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for
not more than 45 school days pursuant to NRS 392.4645, if the

discretion, reduce or eliminate the period of suspension, convert an
expulsion to a suspension or otherwise reduce, eliminate or alter a
disciplinary action imposed upon a pupil who commits a battery
which results in the bodily injury of an employee of the school.
[15.] 18. The principal of a public school may reduce the
period of suspension or convert an expulsion to a suspension for a

body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 177–Senator Ohrenschall
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a
homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care to a temporary
alternative placement under certain circumstances; revising
the requirement for the principal of a school to consult with
certain persons before determining that a homeless pupil or a
pupil in foster care is a habitual disciplinary problem;
revising the procedure for the suspension of homeless pupils
or pupils in foster care and the procedure for determining
whether homelessness or placement in foster care is a factor
in the behavior of certain pupils; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine
that a pupil who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual
disciplinary problem. (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11
years of age or older is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem and the school has
made a reasonable effort to complete a plan of action based on restorative justice
with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to suspend the pupil, or under
extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school. (NRS 392.466)
Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care may be
determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the principal
to conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons.
Section 1.5 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to
additionally include the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a
court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
Existing law requires that, to suspend from school a pupil who is homeless or
has been placed in foster care for not more than 5 days, a determination must be
made, after consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster
care was not a factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person
responsible for making such a determination is required to presume that
homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior and make the
determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS 392.466, 392.467)
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize a principal to suspend a homeless pupil or a
pupil in foster care for 5 days or less without consideration of whether being
homeless or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil and to
consider such factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. As soon as
practicable and not later than the 10th school day after the pupil is suspended,
sections 2 and 3 require the principal to consider whether the behavior was caused
by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being
homeless during a meeting with certain persons who have an interest in the
education of the pupil. If during such a meeting it is determined that the conduct
was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or
being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the principal to either: (1)
end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with behavioral and academic
support; or (2) assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for not more
than 45 school days if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or the behavior

that led to the suspension consisted of, while at school or a school activity,
possessing a dangerous weapon or firearm, engaging in certain actions relating to
controlled substances or committing a battery intended to cause bodily injury.
Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to continue the temporary
alternative placement of such a pupil for more than 45 days if the principal
determines that the continued temporary placement is necessary for the safety of
the pupil or others. Section 1 requires the principal to make such a determination
after holding a meeting with the local educational agency liaison for homeless
pupils or educational decision maker of the pupil and a contact person at the school.
If the principal makes such a determination, section 1 additionally requires the
principal to provide targeted intervention to the pupil and notify the educational
decision maker appointed for the pupil concerning the right to an evaluation to
determine if the pupil is eligible for special education and related services.
Additionally, section 1 requires the principal to hold a meeting to create a plan for
the transition of the pupil from the temporary alternative placement if the pupil is
assigned to a temporary alternative placement for more than 21 days.
Sections 1.5-3 additionally require that the school have been given notice that
the pupil is homeless or in foster care before the school is required to perform the
tasks set forth in those sections.

compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq., be:
(a) Suspended from school pursuant to this section for not more
than 10 days. Such a suspension may be imposed pursuant to this
paragraph for each occurrence of conduct proscribed by
subsection 1.
(b) Expelled from school pursuant to this section.
(c) Permanently expelled from school pursuant to this section.
13. [A] If a school has notice that the pupil is homeless or in
foster care, a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care may be
suspended from school pursuant to this section for [not] more than 5
days if, following a review of all available information [,] and, if an
educational decision maker has been appointed for the pupil
pursuant to NRS 432B.462, a meeting with the educational
decision maker for the pupil, the principal determines that the
conduct of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other
persons at the school and if a determination is made that
homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The
person responsible for making a determination of whether or not
homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise
pursuant to this subsection. A determination that homelessness was
not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation with the
local educational agency liaison for homeless pupils designated in
accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of
1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school,
including, without limitation, a school counselor or school social
worker. A determination that being in foster care was not a factor in
the behavior must be made in consultation with an advocate for
pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled or
the school counselor of the pupil.]
14. As soon as possible and not later than the 10th school day
after the pupil was suspended from school pursuant to subsection
13, the principal shall review all relevant information to consider
whether the behavior which led to the suspension was caused by
or had a direct and substantial relationship to the pupil being in
foster care or being homeless in a meeting with the educational
decision maker for the pupil or surrogate parent, if one has been
appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.462 or 34 C.F.R. § 300.519, as
applicable, an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school and
any other person the principal determines necessary. The relevant

(b) The pupil’s academic plan, if one exists;
(c) Observations by staff of the conduct leading to suspension
and the pupil generally; and

15. If during the meeting held pursuant to subsection 14, the
principal determines that the behavior leading to suspension was
caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in

with behavioral and academic support, including, without
limitation, the development of or revisions to an academic plan; or
(b) Assign the pupil to a temporary alternative placement for
not more than 45 school days pursuant to NRS 392.4645, if the
pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem pursuant to NRS 392.4655
or the behavior that led to the suspension consisted of, while on
the premises of any public school, at an activity sponsored by a
public school or on any school bus:
(1) Possessing a dangerous weapon or firearm;
(2) Knowingly possessing, using, selling, distributing or
soliciting for sale a controlled substance; or
(3) Committing a battery with the intent to cause bodily
injury.
16. If the principal provides three written notices on 3
separate days requesting a person attend a meeting required by
subsection 13 or 14 and does not receive a response from the
person within 24 hours after sending the third notice, the principal
may hold the meeting without that person.
17. The principal of a public school may, at his or her
discretion, reduce or eliminate the period of suspension, convert an
expulsion to a suspension or otherwise reduce, eliminate or alter a
disciplinary action imposed upon a pupil who commits a battery
which results in the bodily injury of an employee of the school.
[15.] 18. The principal of a public school may reduce the
period of suspension or convert an expulsion to a suspension for a
pupil who distributes a controlled substance while on the premises
of a public school, at an activity sponsored by a public school or on
a school bus if:
(a) The pupil is less than 11 years of age;

[18.] 21. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a pupil
who is suspended or expelled from enrolling in a charter school that
is designed exclusively for the enrollment of pupils with disciplinary
problems if the pupil is accepted for enrollment by the charter
school pursuant to NRS 388A.453 or 388A.456. Upon request, the
governing body of a charter school must be provided with access to

this subsection and subsections 5 and 6 of NRS 392.466, a pupil
who is at least 6 years of age but less than 11 years of age must not
be expelled or permanently expelled from school. In extraordinary
circumstances, a school may request an exception to the prohibition

the board of trustees of the school district or the governing body of
the charter school or university school, as applicable.
2. A pupil who is less than 6 years of age must not be
permanently expelled from school.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, no pupil may
be suspended or expelled until the pupil has been given notice of the
charges against him or her, an explanation of the evidence and an
opportunity to schedule a hearing, except that a pupil who:
(a) Poses a continuing danger to persons or property;
(b) Is an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process;
(c) Is selling or distributing any controlled substance; or
(d) Is found to be in possession of a firearm or a dangerous
weapon as provided in NRS 392.466,

an explanation of the reasons for his or her removal and pending
proceedings, to be conducted as soon as practicable after removal,
for the pupil’s suspension or expulsion.
4. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS do not apply to any

5. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing
body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
pupils, as applicable, or its designee shall not authorize the

school system solely for offenses related to attendance or because
the pupil is declared a truant or habitual truant in accordance with
NRS 392.130 or 392.140.
6. A pupil with a disability may, in accordance with the
procedural policy adopted by the board of trustees of the school
district or the governing body of the charter school or university
school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, for such matters

(a) Suspended from school pursuant to this section for not more
than 10 days for each occurrence of proscribed conduct.
(b) Expelled from school pursuant to this section.
(c) Permanently expelled from school pursuant to this section.
7. [A] If the school is on notice that a pupil is homeless or in
foster care, a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care may be
suspended from school pursuant to this section for [not] more than 5
days if, following a review of all available information [,] and, if an
educational decision maker has been appointed for the pupil
pursuant to NRS 432B.462, a meeting with the educational
decision maker for the pupil, the principal determines that the
conduct of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other
persons at the school and if a determination is made that
homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The
person responsible for making a determination of whether or not
homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise
pursuant to this subsection. A determination that homelessness was
not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation with the
local educational agency liaison for homeless pupils designated in
accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of
1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school,
