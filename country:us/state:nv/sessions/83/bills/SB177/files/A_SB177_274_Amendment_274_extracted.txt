EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a homeless
pupil or a pupil in foster care to a temporary alternative placement
under certain circumstances; revising the requirement for the
principal of a school to consult with certain persons before determining
that a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care is a habitual disciplinary
problem ; [or suspending or expelling such a pupil;] revising [certain
presumptions used when] the procedure for the suspension of
homeless pupils or pupils in foster care and the procedure for
determining whether homelessness or placement in foster care is a
factor in the behavior of certain pupils; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine that a pupil
2 who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual disciplinary problem.
3 (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11 years of age or older is deemed a
4 habitual disciplinary problem and the school has made a reasonable effort to complete a plan
5 of action based on restorative justice with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to
6 suspend the pupil, or under extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school.
7 (NRS 392.466) Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care
8 may be determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
9 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill requires the principal to
10 conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons. Section [1] 1.5
11 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to additionally include
12 the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a court under existing law. (NRS
13 432B.462)
14 Existing law requires that, to suspend [or expel] from school a pupil who is homeless or
15 has been placed in foster care [,] for not more than 5 days, a determination must be made,
16 after consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
17 factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person responsible for making such
18 a determination is required to presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
19 factor in the behavior and make the determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS
Senate Amendment No. 274 to Senate Bill No. 177 Page 4
20 392.466, 392.467) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill [change the presumption used to determine]
21 authorize a principal to suspend a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care for 5 days or
22 less without consideration of whether being homeless or being in foster care was a factor in
23 the behavior of the pupil [by requiring the person responsible for making the determination to
24 presume that homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior. Sections] and
25 to consider such factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. On the 6th
26 school day of a pupil being suspended, sections 2 and 3 [also] require [: (1) the person
27 making the determining to conduct] the principal to consider whether the behavior was
28 caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being
29 homeless during a meeting with certain persons [rather than consult with those persons; and
30 (2)] who have an interest in the education of the pupil. If during such a meeting
31 [concerning a pupil who is in foster care to additionally include the educational decision
32 maker appointed for the pupil by a court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)] it is
33 determined that the conduct was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil
34 being in foster care or being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the principal
35 to end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with behavioral and academic
36 support.
37 Existing law authorizes the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom or other
38 premises of a public school under certain circumstances. Existing law prohibits a
39 principal from temporarily removing a pupil if the pupil is required to be suspended.
40 (NRS 392.4645) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to temporarily remove a
41 homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care for not more than 45 days if the pupil is a
42 habitual disciplinary problem or at school or a school activity possesses a dangerous
43 weapon or firearm, engages in certain actions relating to controlled substances or
44 commits a battery intended to cause bodily injury. If such a pupil is temporarily
45 removed, section 1 additionally requires the principal to then review all relevant
46 information to determine whether the behavior was caused by or substantially related to
47 the pupil being homeless or in foster care. If the principal makes such a determination,
48 section 1 additionally requires the principal to hold a meeting with certain persons
49 interested in the education of the pupil to review the pupil’s academic plan for
50 application to the temporary removal and make revisions to the plan.

27 of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other persons at the school and
28 if a determination is made that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor
29 in the behavior that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The

49 surrogate parent, if one has been appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.462 or 34
50 C.F.R. § 300.519, as applicable, an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school

21 (b) The pupil has not engaged in such proscribed conduct before; and
22 (c) After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances, the principal
23 determines that the pupil did not know that the substance being distributed was a
24 controlled substance.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a homeless
pupil or a pupil in foster care to a temporary alternative placement
under certain circumstances; revising the requirement for the
principal of a school to consult with certain persons before determining
that a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care is a habitual disciplinary
problem ; [or suspending or expelling such a pupil;] revising [certain
presumptions used when] the procedure for the suspension of
homeless pupils or pupils in foster care and the procedure for
determining whether homelessness or placement in foster care is a
factor in the behavior of certain pupils; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine that a pupil
2 who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual disciplinary problem.
3 (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11 years of age or older is deemed a
4 habitual disciplinary problem and the school has made a reasonable effort to complete a plan
5 of action based on restorative justice with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to
6 suspend the pupil, or under extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school.
7 (NRS 392.466) Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care
8 may be determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
9 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill requires the principal to
10 conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons. Section [1] 1.5
11 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to additionally include
12 the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a court under existing law. (NRS
13 432B.462)
14 Existing law requires that, to suspend [or expel] from school a pupil who is homeless or
15 has been placed in foster care [,] for not more than 5 days, a determination must be made,
16 after consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
17 factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person responsible for making such
18 a determination is required to presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
19 factor in the behavior and make the determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS

Senate Amendment No. 274 to Senate Bill No. 177 Page 4
20 392.466, 392.467) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill [change the presumption used to determine]
21 authorize a principal to suspend a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care for 5 days or
22 less without consideration of whether being homeless or being in foster care was a factor in
23 the behavior of the pupil [by requiring the person responsible for making the determination to
24 presume that homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior. Sections] and
25 to consider such factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. On the 6th
26 school day of a pupil being suspended, sections 2 and 3 [also] require [: (1) the person
27 making the determining to conduct] the principal to consider whether the behavior was
28 caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being
29 homeless during a meeting with certain persons [rather than consult with those persons; and
30 (2)] who have an interest in the education of the pupil. If during such a meeting
31 [concerning a pupil who is in foster care to additionally include the educational decision
32 maker appointed for the pupil by a court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)] it is
33 determined that the conduct was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil
34 being in foster care or being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require the principal
35 to end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with behavioral and academic
36 support.
37 Existing law authorizes the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom or other
38 premises of a public school under certain circumstances. Existing law prohibits a
39 principal from temporarily removing a pupil if the pupil is required to be suspended.
40 (NRS 392.4645) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to temporarily remove a
41 homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care for not more than 45 days if the pupil is a
42 habitual disciplinary problem or at school or a school activity possesses a dangerous
43 weapon or firearm, engages in certain actions relating to controlled substances or
44 commits a battery intended to cause bodily injury. If such a pupil is temporarily
45 removed, section 1 additionally requires the principal to then review all relevant
46 information to determine whether the behavior was caused by or substantially related to
47 the pupil being homeless or in foster care. If the principal makes such a determination,
48 section 1 additionally requires the principal to hold a meeting with certain persons
49 interested in the education of the pupil to review the pupil’s academic plan for
50 application to the temporary removal and make revisions to the plan.

29 6. If a pupil commits the same act for which notice was provided pursuant to
30 subsection 3 after he or she enters into a plan of behavior pursuant to subsection 5,
31 the pupil shall be deemed to have not successfully completed the plan of behavior
32 and may be deemed a habitual disciplinary problem.
33 7. A pupil may, pursuant to the provisions of this section, enter into one plan

41 receipt of such a request, the superintendent of the school district or the
42 administrative head of the charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
43 pupils, as applicable, shall review the determination in accordance with the
44 procedure established by the board of trustees of the school district or the governing
45 body of the charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as
46 applicable, for such matters.
