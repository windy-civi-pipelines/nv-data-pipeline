EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a principal to assign a
homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care to a temporary
alternative placement under certain circumstances;
revising the requirement for the principal of a school to
consult with certain persons before determining that a
homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care is a habitual
disciplinary problem; revising the procedure for the
suspension of homeless pupils or pupils in foster care and
the procedure for determining whether homelessness or
placement in foster care is a factor in the behavior of
certain pupils; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the process for the principal of a school to determine
2 that a pupil who is 11 years of age or older and enrolled in the school is a habitual
3 disciplinary problem. (NRS 392.4655) Under existing law, if a pupil who is 11
4 years of age or older is deemed a habitual disciplinary problem and the school has
5 made a reasonable effort to complete a plan of action based on restorative justice
6 with the pupil, the principal is generally authorized to suspend the pupil, or under
7 extraordinary circumstances, expel the pupil from the school. (NRS 392.466)
8 Existing law provides that before a pupil who is homeless or in foster care may be
9 determined to be a habitual disciplinary problem, the principal is required to consult
10 with certain persons. (NRS 392.4655) Section 1.5 of this bill requires the principal
11 to conduct a meeting with those persons rather than consult with those persons.
12 Section 1.5 also requires such a meeting concerning a pupil who is in foster care to
-
*SB177_R1*

– 2 –
13 additionally include the educational decision maker appointed for the pupil by a
14 court under existing law. (NRS 432B.462)
15 Existing law requires that, to suspend from school a pupil who is homeless or
16 has been placed in foster care for not more than 5 days, a determination must be
17 made, after consultation with certain persons, that homelessness or being in foster
18 care was not a factor in the behavior of the pupil. Under existing law, the person
19 responsible for making such a determination is required to presume that
20 homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior and make the
21 determination in consultation with certain persons. (NRS 392.466, 392.467)
22 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize a principal to suspend a homeless pupil or a
23 pupil in foster care for 5 days or less without consideration of whether being
24 homeless or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior of the pupil and to
25 consider such factors when the pupil is suspended for more than 5 days. On the 6th
26 school day of a pupil being suspended, sections 2 and 3 require the principal to
27 consider whether the behavior was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the
28 pupil being in foster care or being homeless during a meeting with certain persons
29 who have an interest in the education of the pupil. If during such a meeting it is
30 determined that the conduct was caused by or had a substantial relationship to the
31 pupil being in foster care or being homeless, sections 2 and 3 additionally require
32 the principal to end the period of suspension and provide the pupil with behavioral
33 and academic support.
34 Existing law authorizes the temporary removal of a pupil from a classroom or
35 other premises of a public school under certain circumstances. Existing law
36 prohibits a principal from temporarily removing a pupil if the pupil is required to be
37 suspended. (NRS 392.4645) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a principal to
38 temporarily remove a homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care for not more than 45
39 days if the pupil is a habitual disciplinary problem or at school or a school activity
40 possesses a dangerous weapon or firearm, engages in certain actions relating to
41 controlled substances or commits a battery intended to cause bodily injury. If such
42 a pupil is temporarily removed, section 1 additionally requires the principal to then
43 review all relevant information to determine whether the behavior was caused by or
44 substantially related to the pupil being homeless or in foster care. If the principal
45 makes such a determination, section 1 additionally requires the principal to hold a
46 meeting with certain persons interested in the education of the pupil to review the
47 pupil’s academic plan for application to the temporary removal and make revisions
48 to the plan.

2 pupil may be suspended, expelled or placed in another school. If a
3 pupil, including, without limitation, a pupil who is less than 11 years
4 of age, is placed in another school, the current school of the pupil
5 shall explain what services will be provided to the pupil at the new
6 school that the current school is unable to provide to address the
7 specific needs and behaviors of the pupil. The current school of the
8 pupil shall coordinate with the new school to create a plan of action
9 based on restorative justice for the pupil and to ensure that any
10 resources required to execute the plan of action based on restorative
11 justice are available at the new school.
12 8. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a pupil is
13 deemed a habitual disciplinary problem pursuant to NRS 392.4655
14 and the school has made a reasonable effort to complete a plan of

45 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as
-

15 university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, for
16 such matters and only after the board of trustees of the school
17 district or governing body, as applicable, or its designee has
18 reviewed the circumstances and determined that the action is in

29 days if, following a review of all available information [,] and, if an
30 educational decision maker has been appointed for the pupil
31 pursuant to NRS 432B.462, a meeting with the educational
32 decision maker for the pupil, the principal determines that the
33 conduct of the pupil poses an ongoing threat to the pupil or other
34 persons at the school and if a determination is made that
35 homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
36 that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. [The
37 person responsible for making a determination of whether or not
38 homelessness or being in foster care was a factor in the behavior
39 shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was not a
40 factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise
41 pursuant to this subsection. A determination that homelessness was
42 not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation with the
43 local educational agency liaison for homeless pupils designated in
44 accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of
45 1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school,

2 worker. A determination that being in foster care was not a factor in
3 the behavior must be made in consultation with an advocate for
4 pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled or
5 the school counselor of the pupil.]
6 14. On the 6th school day after the pupil was suspended from
7 school pursuant to subsection 13, the principal shall review all
8 relevant information to consider whether the behavior which lead
9 to the suspension was caused by or had a direct and substantial
10 relationship to the pupil being in foster care or being homeless in
11 a meeting with the educational decision maker for the pupil or
12 surrogate parent, if one has been appointed pursuant to NRS
13 432B.462 or 34 C.F.R. § 300.519, as applicable, an advocate for

22 15. If during the meeting held pursuant to subsection 14, the
23 principal determines that the behavior leading to suspension was
24 caused by or had a substantial relationship to the pupil being in
25 foster care or being homeless, the principal shall:
26 (a) Eliminate the period of suspension pursuant to subsection
27 16; and
28 (b) Provide the pupil with behavioral and academic support,
29 including, without limitation, the development of or revisions to an
30 academic plan.
31 16. The principal of a public school may, at his or her
32 discretion, reduce or eliminate the period of suspension, convert an
33 expulsion to a suspension or otherwise reduce, eliminate or alter a
34 disciplinary action imposed upon a pupil who commits a battery
35 which results in the bodily injury of an employee of the school.
36 [15.] 17. The principal of a public school may reduce the
37 period of suspension or convert an expulsion to a suspension for a
38 pupil who distributes a controlled substance while on the premises

40 a school bus if:
41 (a) The pupil is less than 11 years of age;
42 (b) The pupil has not engaged in such proscribed conduct
43 before; and

2 principal determines that the pupil did not know that the substance
3 being distributed was a controlled substance.
4 [16.] 18. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS do not apply
