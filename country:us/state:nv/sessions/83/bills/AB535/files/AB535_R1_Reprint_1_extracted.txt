SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the sales tax
exemption for organizations created for religious,
charitable or educational purposes. (BDR 32-812)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
administration of the exemption from sales and use taxes
for organizations created for religious, charitable or
educational purposes; requiring the Department of
Taxation to report to the Legislature certain information
concerning applications for such an exemption; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross
2 receipts of the retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State,
3 and requires the retailer to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction
4 to which the sales tax applies. (NRS 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115)
5 Existing law also imposes a use tax on the storage, use or other consumption in this
6 State of tangible personal property purchased outside of this State from a retailer in
7 a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this State if it had
8 occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
9 Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any
10 tangible personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for
11 religious, charitable or educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under
12 existing law, among other requirements, an organization that claims this exemption
13 is required to establish that the sole or primary purpose of the organization is to
14 further certain specified purposes deemed to be religious, charitable or educational.
15 (NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill establish criteria for the
16 Department of Taxation and the Nevada Tax Commission to use to determine
17 whether an organization satisfies that requirement, including, without limitation, by
18 the organization establishing that it: (1) operates exclusively for a purpose exempt
19 under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is recognized as exempt
20 by the Internal Revenue Service under the provision of that section; or (2) furthers
-

21 at least one of certain specified purposes. Sections 1.5 and 2.3 of this bill require
22 the Department to: (1) provide to an organization that does not qualify for the
23 exemption a full explanation outlining the reasons why the organization does not
24 qualify and the procedure to appeal such a determination; and (2) submit to the
25 Legislature every odd-numbered year a report concerning applications for the tax
26 exemption.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 535–COMMITTEE ON REVENUE
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the sales tax
exemption for organizations created for religious,
charitable or educational purposes. (BDR 32-812)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
administration of the exemption from sales and use taxes
for organizations created for religious, charitable or
educational purposes; requiring the Department of
Taxation to report to the Legislature certain information
concerning applications for such an exemption; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross
2 receipts of the retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State,
3 and requires the retailer to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction
4 to which the sales tax applies. (NRS 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115)
5 Existing law also imposes a use tax on the storage, use or other consumption in this
6 State of tangible personal property purchased outside of this State from a retailer in
7 a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this State if it had
8 occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
9 Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any
10 tangible personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for
11 religious, charitable or educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under
12 existing law, among other requirements, an organization that claims this exemption
13 is required to establish that the sole or primary purpose of the organization is to
14 further certain specified purposes deemed to be religious, charitable or educational.
15 (NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill establish criteria for the
16 Department of Taxation and the Nevada Tax Commission to use to determine
17 whether an organization satisfies that requirement, including, without limitation, by
18 the organization establishing that it: (1) operates exclusively for a purpose exempt
19 under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is recognized as exempt
20 by the Internal Revenue Service under the provision of that section; or (2) furthers
-
*AB535_R1*

– 2 –
21 at least one of certain specified purposes. Sections 1.5 and 2.3 of this bill require
22 the Department to: (1) provide to an organization that does not qualify for the
23 exemption a full explanation outlining the reasons why the organization does not
24 qualify and the procedure to appeal such a determination; and (2) submit to the
25 Legislature every odd-numbered year a report concerning applications for the tax
26 exemption.
