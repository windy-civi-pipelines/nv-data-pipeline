Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
administration of the exemption from sales and use taxes for
organizations created for religious, charitable or educational
purposes; requiring the Department of Taxation to report to
the Legislature certain information concerning applications
for such an exemption; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross
receipts of the retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State,
and requires the retailer to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction
to which the sales tax applies. (NRS 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115)
Existing law also imposes a use tax on the storage, use or other consumption in this
State of tangible personal property purchased outside of this State from a retailer in
a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this State if it had
occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any
tangible personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for
religious, charitable or educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under
existing law, among other requirements, an organization that claims this exemption
is required to establish that the sole or primary purpose of the organization is to
further certain specified purposes deemed to be religious, charitable or educational.
(NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill establish criteria for the
Department of Taxation and the Nevada Tax Commission to use to determine
whether an organization satisfies the requirements to be exempt from sales and use
taxes as a charitable organization, including, without limitation, by the organization
establishing that it: (1) operates exclusively for a purpose exempt under section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is recognized as exempt by the Internal
Revenue Service under the provision of that section; or (2) furthers at least one of
certain specified purposes. Sections 1.5 and 2.3 of this bill require the Department
to: (1) provide to an organization that does not qualify for the exemption as a
religious, charitable or educational organization a full explanation outlining the
reasons why the organization does not qualify and the procedure to appeal such a
determination; and (2) submit to the Legislature every odd-numbered year a report
concerning applications for the tax exemption.

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
administration of the exemption from sales and use taxes for
organizations created for religious, charitable or educational
purposes; requiring the Department of Taxation to report to
the Legislature certain information concerning applications
for such an exemption; and providing other matters properly

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross
receipts of the retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State,
and requires the retailer to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction
to which the sales tax applies. (NRS 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115)
Existing law also imposes a use tax on the storage, use or other consumption in this
State of tangible personal property purchased outside of this State from a retailer in
a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this State if it had
occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any
tangible personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for
religious, charitable or educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under
existing law, among other requirements, an organization that claims this exemption
is required to establish that the sole or primary purpose of the organization is to
further certain specified purposes deemed to be religious, charitable or educational.
(NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill establish criteria for the
Department of Taxation and the Nevada Tax Commission to use to determine
whether an organization satisfies the requirements to be exempt from sales and use
taxes as a charitable organization, including, without limitation, by the organization
establishing that it: (1) operates exclusively for a purpose exempt under section
