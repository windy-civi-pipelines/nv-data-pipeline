Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the sales tax exemption for
organizations created for religious, charitable or educational
purposes. (BDR 32-812)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the administration of
the exemption from sales and use taxes for organizations created for
religious, charitable or educational purposes; requiring the Department
of Taxation to report to the Legislature certain information concerning
applications for such an exemption; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross receipts of the
2 retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State, and requires the retailer
3 to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction to which the sales tax applies. (NRS
4 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115) Existing law also imposes a use tax on the
5 storage, use or other consumption in this State of tangible personal property purchased outside
6 of this State from a retailer in a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this
7 State if it had occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
8 Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any tangible
9 personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for religious, charitable or
10 educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under existing law, among other
11 requirements, an organization that claims this exemption is required to establish that the sole
12 or primary purpose of the organization is to further certain specified purposes deemed to be
13 religious, charitable or educational. (NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
14 establish criteria for the Department of Taxation and the Nevada Tax Commission to use to
15 determine whether an organization satisfies [that requirement,] the requirements to be
16 exempt from sales and use taxes as a charitable organization, including, without
17 limitation, by the organization establishing that it: (1) operates exclusively for a purpose
18 exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is recognized as exempt by
19 the Internal Revenue Service under the provision of that section; or (2) furthers at least one of
20 certain specified purposes. Sections 1.5 and 2.3 of this bill require the Department to: (1)
21 provide to an organization that does not qualify for the exemption as a religious, charitable
22 or educational organization a full explanation outlining the reasons why the organization
23 does not qualify and the procedure to appeal such a determination; and (2) submit to the
24 Legislature every odd-numbered year a report concerning applications for the tax exemption.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the sales tax exemption for
organizations created for religious, charitable or educational
purposes. (BDR 32-812)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the administration of
the exemption from sales and use taxes for organizations created for
religious, charitable or educational purposes; requiring the Department
of Taxation to report to the Legislature certain information concerning
applications for such an exemption; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross receipts of the
2 retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State, and requires the retailer
3 to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction to which the sales tax applies. (NRS
4 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115) Existing law also imposes a use tax on the
5 storage, use or other consumption in this State of tangible personal property purchased outside
6 of this State from a retailer in a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this
7 State if it had occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
8 Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any tangible
9 personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for religious, charitable or
10 educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under existing law, among other
11 requirements, an organization that claims this exemption is required to establish that the sole
12 or primary purpose of the organization is to further certain specified purposes deemed to be
13 religious, charitable or educational. (NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
14 establish criteria for the Department of Taxation and the Nevada Tax Commission to use to
15 determine whether an organization satisfies [that requirement,] the requirements to be
16 exempt from sales and use taxes as a charitable organization, including, without
17 limitation, by the organization establishing that it: (1) operates exclusively for a purpose
18 exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is recognized as exempt by
19 the Internal Revenue Service under the provision of that section; or (2) furthers at least one of
20 certain specified purposes. Sections 1.5 and 2.3 of this bill require the Department to: (1)
21 provide to an organization that does not qualify for the exemption as a religious, charitable
22 or educational organization a full explanation outlining the reasons why the organization
23 does not qualify and the procedure to appeal such a determination; and (2) submit to the
24 Legislature every odd-numbered year a report concerning applications for the tax exemption.
