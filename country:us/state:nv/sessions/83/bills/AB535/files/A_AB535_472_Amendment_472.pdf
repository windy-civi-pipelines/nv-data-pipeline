~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the administration of
the exemption from sales and use taxes for organizations created for
religious, charitable or educational purposes; requiring the
Department of Taxation to report to the Legislature certain
information concerning applications for such an exemption; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes upon each retailer a sales tax measured by the gross receipts of the
2 retailer from the retail sale of tangible personal property in this State, and requires the retailer
3 to collect the sales tax from the purchaser in a transaction to which the sales tax applies. (NRS
4 372.105, 372.110, 374.110, 374.111, 374.115) Existing law also imposes a use tax on the
5 storage, use or other consumption in this State of tangible personal property purchased outside
6 of this State from a retailer in a transaction that would have been subject to the sales tax in this
7 State if it had occurred within this State. (NRS 372.185, 374.190, 374.191)
8 Existing law exempts from such taxes the gross receipts from the sale of any tangible
9 personal property sold by or to a nonprofit organization created for religious, charitable or
10 educational purposes. (NRS 372.326, 374.3306) Under existing law, among other
11 requirements, an organization that claims this exemption is required to establish that the sole
12 or primary purpose of the organization is to further certain specified purposes deemed to be
13 religious, charitable or educational. (NRS 372.3261, 374.3306) [This] Sections 1 and 2 of
14 this bill [authorizes] establish criteria for the Department of Taxation and the Nevada
15 Tax Commission to use to determine whether an organization [to satisfy] satisfies that
16 requirement , including, without limitation, by the organization establishing that it : (1)
17 operates exclusively for a purpose exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
18 Code and is recognized as exempt by the Internal Revenue Service under the provision of that
19 section [.] ; or (2) furthers at least one of certain specified purposes. Sections 1.5 and 2.3
20 of this bill require the Department to: (1) provide to an organization that does not
21 qualify for the exemption a full explanation outlining the reasons why the organization
22 does not qualify and the procedure to appeal such a determination; and (2) submit to the
23 Legislature every odd-numbered year a report concerning applications for the tax
24 exemption.
