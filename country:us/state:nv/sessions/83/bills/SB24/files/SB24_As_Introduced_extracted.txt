Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the certification and regulation of emergency medical
2 technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics: (1) in a
3 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the
4 district board of health; or (2) in a county whose population is less than 700,000
5 (currently all counties other than Clark County), the State Board of Health and the
6 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
7 Services. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.077, 450B.130, 450B.180, 450B.1905-450B.1975)

8 Existing regulations provide for the certification of emergency medical responders.
9 (NAC 450B.355) Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 of this bill codify into law provisions for
10 the certification and regulation of emergency medical responders by the same
11 entities responsible for certifying and regulating emergency medical technicians,
12 advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics. Section 2 of this bill
13 defines the term “emergency medical responder.” Section 3 of this bill applies the
14 definition set forth in section 2 to the provisions governing emergency medical
15 services.
16 Section 10 of this bill prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as
17 an emergency medical responder unless the person holds a valid certification as an
18 emergency medical responder. A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a
19 misdemeanor and is also subject to administrative penalties. (NRS 450B.900)
20 Sections 1, 5, 7 and 11-28 of this bill make various revisions so that
21 emergency medical responders are treated similarly to emergency medical
22 technicians with regard to: (1) workplace safety, legal protections and benefits; (2)
23 the submission of written nominations by employee organizations for appointment
24 to the Committee on Emergency Medical Services; (3) the applicability of
25 provisions governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment; (4) the authority
26 to administer auto-injectable epinephrine and opioid antagonists; (5) the collection
27 of certain data; (6) legal protections for certain providers of health care who
28 provide instruction to emergency medical personnel at the scene of an emergency
29 or while transporting a sick or injured person; (7) the staffing of certain facilities;
30 and (8) certain other provisions governing reporting and the retention of records.

3 2. When possible, before filing a petition pursuant to
4 subsection 1, the person, employer or public agency for which the
5 person volunteers, and who is petitioning shall submit information
6 concerning the likely exposure to a communicable disease to the
7 designated health care officer for the employer or public agency or,
8 if there is no designated health care officer, the person designated by
9 the employer or public agency to document and verify likely
10 exposure to communicable diseases, for verification that there was
11 substantial exposure. Each designated health care officer or person
12 designated by an employer or public agency to document and verify
13 likely exposure to communicable diseases shall establish guidelines
14 based on current scientific information to determine substantial
15 exposure.
16 3. A court shall promptly hear a petition filed pursuant to
17 subsection 1 and determine whether there is probable cause to
18 believe that a likely transfer of blood or other bodily fluids occurred
19 between the person who filed the petition or on whose behalf the
20 petition was filed and the person or decedent who likely exposed
21 him or her to a communicable disease. If the court determines that
22 such probable cause exists, the court shall:
23 (a) Order the person who likely exposed the petitioner, or the
24 person on whose behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable
25 disease to submit two appropriate specimens to a local hospital or
26 medical laboratory for testing for exposure to a communicable
27 disease; or
28 (b) Order that two appropriate specimens be taken from the
29 decedent who likely exposed the petitioner, or the person on whose
30 behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable disease and be
31 submitted to a local hospital or medical laboratory for testing for
32 exposure to the communicable disease.
33  The local hospital or medical laboratory shall perform the test in
34 accordance with generally accepted medical practices and shall
35 disclose the results of the test in the manner set forth in
36 NRS 629.069.
37 4. If a judge or a justice of the peace enters an order pursuant to
38 this section, the judge or justice of the peace may authorize the
39 designated health care officer or the person designated by the
40 employer or public agency to document and verify likely exposure
41 to a communicable disease to sign the name of the judge or justice
42 of the peace on a duplicate order. Such a duplicate order shall be
43 deemed to be an order of the court. As soon as practicable after the
44 duplicate order is signed, the duplicate order must be returned to the
45 judge or justice of the peace who authorized the signing of it and
-
*SB24*

1 must indicate on its face the judge or justice of the peace to whom it
2 is to be returned. The judge or justice of the peace, upon receiving
3 the returned order, shall endorse the order with his or her name and
4 enter the date on which the order was returned. Any failure of the
5 judge or justice of the peace to make such an endorsement and entry
6 does not in and of itself invalidate the order.
7 5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 629.069, all records
8 submitted to the court in connection with a petition filed pursuant to
9 this section and any proceedings concerning the petition are
10 confidential and the judge or justice of the peace shall order the
11 records and any record of the proceedings to be sealed and to be
12 opened for inspection only upon an order of the court for good cause
13 shown.
14 6. A court may establish rules to allow a judge or justice of the
15 peace to conduct a hearing or issue an order pursuant to this section
16 by electronic or telephonic means.
17 7. The employer of a person or the public agency for which the
18 person volunteers, who files a petition or on whose behalf a petition

S.B. 24
SENATE BILL NO. 24–COMMITTEE ON
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
(ON BEHALF OF THE DIVISION OF PUBLIC AND
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 7, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Provides for the certification and regulation of
emergency medical responders. (BDR 40-292)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; providing for the
certification and regulation of emergency medical
responders; prescribing certain duties and authority of an
emergency medical responder; prohibiting a person from
representing himself or herself as an emergency medical
responder without a valid certification; applying certain
legal protections for emergency medical services to
emergency medical responders; authorizing the collection
of certain data from an applicant for the renewal of a
certificate as an emergency medical responder; requiring
the reporting of certain data concerning veterans who
apply for and receive certification as an emergency
medical responder; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the certification and regulation of emergency medical
2 technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics: (1) in a
3 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the
4 district board of health; or (2) in a county whose population is less than 700,000
5 (currently all counties other than Clark County), the State Board of Health and the
6 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
7 Services. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.077, 450B.130, 450B.180, 450B.1905-450B.1975)

– 2 –
8 Existing regulations provide for the certification of emergency medical responders.
9 (NAC 450B.355) Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 of this bill codify into law provisions for
10 the certification and regulation of emergency medical responders by the same
11 entities responsible for certifying and regulating emergency medical technicians,
12 advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics. Section 2 of this bill
13 defines the term “emergency medical responder.” Section 3 of this bill applies the
14 definition set forth in section 2 to the provisions governing emergency medical
15 services.
16 Section 10 of this bill prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as
17 an emergency medical responder unless the person holds a valid certification as an
18 emergency medical responder. A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a
19 misdemeanor and is also subject to administrative penalties. (NRS 450B.900)
20 Sections 1, 5, 7 and 11-28 of this bill make various revisions so that
21 emergency medical responders are treated similarly to emergency medical
22 technicians with regard to: (1) workplace safety, legal protections and benefits; (2)
23 the submission of written nominations by employee organizations for appointment
24 to the Committee on Emergency Medical Services; (3) the applicability of
25 provisions governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment; (4) the authority
26 to administer auto-injectable epinephrine and opioid antagonists; (5) the collection
27 of certain data; (6) legal protections for certain providers of health care who
28 provide instruction to emergency medical personnel at the scene of an emergency
29 or while transporting a sick or injured person; (7) the staffing of certain facilities;
30 and (8) certain other provisions governing reporting and the retention of records.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 441A.195 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 441A.195 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 259.047, a
4 law enforcement officer, correctional officer, emergency medical
5 attendant, firefighter, county coroner or medical examiner or any of
6 their employees or volunteers, any other person who is employed by
7 or is a volunteer for an agency of criminal justice or any other public
8 employee or volunteer for a public agency who, in the course of his
9 or her official duties, comes into contact with human blood or
10 bodily fluids, or the employer of such a person or the public agency
11 for which the person volunteers, may petition a court for an order
12 requiring the testing of a person or decedent for exposure to a
13 communicable disease if:
14 (a) The officer, emergency medical attendant, firefighter, county
15 coroner or medical examiner or their employee or volunteer, other
16 person employed by or volunteering for an agency of criminal
17 justice or other public employee or volunteer for a public agency
18 was likely exposed to a communicable disease; and

20 the appropriate treatment for the officer, emergency medical
-

– 3 –
1 attendant, firefighter, county coroner, medical examiner, employee
2 or volunteer.
3 2. When possible, before filing a petition pursuant to
4 subsection 1, the person, employer or public agency for which the
5 person volunteers, and who is petitioning shall submit information
6 concerning the likely exposure to a communicable disease to the
7 designated health care officer for the employer or public agency or,
8 if there is no designated health care officer, the person designated by
9 the employer or public agency to document and verify likely
10 exposure to communicable diseases, for verification that there was
11 substantial exposure. Each designated health care officer or person
12 designated by an employer or public agency to document and verify
13 likely exposure to communicable diseases shall establish guidelines
14 based on current scientific information to determine substantial
15 exposure.
16 3. A court shall promptly hear a petition filed pursuant to
17 subsection 1 and determine whether there is probable cause to
18 believe that a likely transfer of blood or other bodily fluids occurred
19 between the person who filed the petition or on whose behalf the
20 petition was filed and the person or decedent who likely exposed
21 him or her to a communicable disease. If the court determines that
22 such probable cause exists, the court shall:
23 (a) Order the person who likely exposed the petitioner, or the
24 person on whose behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable
25 disease to submit two appropriate specimens to a local hospital or
26 medical laboratory for testing for exposure to a communicable
27 disease; or
28 (b) Order that two appropriate specimens be taken from the
29 decedent who likely exposed the petitioner, or the person on whose
30 behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable disease and be
31 submitted to a local hospital or medical laboratory for testing for
32 exposure to the communicable disease.
33  The local hospital or medical laboratory shall perform the test in
34 accordance with generally accepted medical practices and shall
35 disclose the results of the test in the manner set forth in
36 NRS 629.069.
37 4. If a judge or a justice of the peace enters an order pursuant to
38 this section, the judge or justice of the peace may authorize the
39 designated health care officer or the person designated by the
40 employer or public agency to document and verify likely exposure
41 to a communicable disease to sign the name of the judge or justice
42 of the peace on a duplicate order. Such a duplicate order shall be
43 deemed to be an order of the court. As soon as practicable after the
44 duplicate order is signed, the duplicate order must be returned to the
45 judge or justice of the peace who authorized the signing of it and
-
*SB24*

– 4 –
1 must indicate on its face the judge or justice of the peace to whom it
2 is to be returned. The judge or justice of the peace, upon receiving
3 the returned order, shall endorse the order with his or her name and
4 enter the date on which the order was returned. Any failure of the
5 judge or justice of the peace to make such an endorsement and entry
6 does not in and of itself invalidate the order.
7 5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 629.069, all records
8 submitted to the court in connection with a petition filed pursuant to
9 this section and any proceedings concerning the petition are
10 confidential and the judge or justice of the peace shall order the
11 records and any record of the proceedings to be sealed and to be
12 opened for inspection only upon an order of the court for good cause
13 shown.
14 6. A court may establish rules to allow a judge or justice of the
15 peace to conduct a hearing or issue an order pursuant to this section
16 by electronic or telephonic means.
17 7. The employer of a person or the public agency for which the
18 person volunteers, who files a petition or on whose behalf a petition
19 is filed pursuant to this section or the insurer of the employer or
20 public agency, shall pay the cost of performing the test pursuant to
21 subsection 3.
