Section 1:
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; providing for the
certification and regulation of emergency medical
responders; prescribing certain duties and authority of an
emergency medical responder; prohibiting a person from
representing himself or herself as an emergency medical
responder without a valid certification; applying certain legal
protections for emergency medical services to emergency
medical responders; authorizing the collection of certain data
from an applicant for the renewal of a certificate as an
emergency medical responder; requiring the reporting of
certain data concerning veterans who apply for and receive
certification as an emergency medical responder; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the certification and regulation of emergency medical
technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics: (1) in a
county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the
district board of health; or (2) in a county whose population is less than 700,000
(currently all counties other than Clark County), the State Board of Health and the
Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.077, 450B.130, 450B.180, 450B.1905-450B.1975)
Existing regulations provide for the certification of emergency medical responders.
(NAC 450B.355) Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 of this bill codify into law provisions for
the certification and regulation of emergency medical responders by the same
entities responsible for certifying and regulating emergency medical technicians,
advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics. Section 2 of this bill
defines the term “emergency medical responder.” Section 3 of this bill applies the
definition set forth in section 2 to the provisions governing emergency medical
services.

Section 2:
Section 10 of this bill prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as
an emergency medical responder unless the person holds a valid certification as an
emergency medical responder. A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a
misdemeanor and is also subject to administrative penalties. (NRS 450B.900)

Section 3:
Sections 1, 5, 7 and 11-28 of this bill make various revisions so that
emergency medical responders are treated similarly to emergency medical
technicians with regard to: (1) workplace safety, legal protections and benefits; (2)
the submission of written nominations by employee organizations for appointment
to the Committee on Emergency Medical Services; (3) the applicability of
provisions governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment; (4) the authority
to administer auto-injectable epinephrine and opioid antagonists; (5) the collection
of certain data; (6) legal protections for certain providers of health care who
provide instruction to emergency medical personnel at the scene of an emergency
or while transporting a sick or injured person; (7) the staffing of certain facilities;
and (8) certain other provisions governing reporting and the retention of records.

law enforcement officer, correctional officer, emergency medical
attendant, firefighter, county coroner or medical examiner or any of
their employees or volunteers, any other person who is employed by
or is a volunteer for an agency of criminal justice or any other public
employee or volunteer for a public agency who, in the course of his
or her official duties, comes into contact with human blood or
bodily fluids, or the employer of such a person or the public agency
for which the person volunteers, may petition a court for an order
requiring the testing of a person or decedent for exposure to a
communicable disease if:
(a) The officer, emergency medical attendant, firefighter, county
coroner or medical examiner or their employee or volunteer, other
person employed by or volunteering for an agency of criminal
justice or other public employee or volunteer for a public agency
was likely exposed to a communicable disease; and
(b) Testing of the person or decedent is necessary to determine
the appropriate treatment for the officer, emergency medical
attendant, firefighter, county coroner, medical examiner, employee
or volunteer.

Section 5:
2. When possible, before filing a petition pursuant to
subsection 1, the person, employer or public agency for which the
person volunteers, and who is petitioning shall submit information
concerning the likely exposure to a communicable disease to the
designated health care officer for the employer or public agency or,
if there is no designated health care officer, the person designated by
the employer or public agency to document and verify likely
exposure to communicable diseases, for verification that there was
substantial exposure. Each designated health care officer or person
designated by an employer or public agency to document and verify
likely exposure to communicable diseases shall establish guidelines
based on current scientific information to determine substantial
exposure.

Section 6:
3. A court shall promptly hear a petition filed pursuant to
subsection 1 and determine whether there is probable cause to
believe that a likely transfer of blood or other bodily fluids occurred
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
between the person who filed the petition or on whose behalf the
petition was filed and the person or decedent who likely exposed
him or her to a communicable disease. If the court determines that
such probable cause exists, the court shall:
(a) Order the person who likely exposed the petitioner, or the
person on whose behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable
disease to submit two appropriate specimens to a local hospital or
medical laboratory for testing for exposure to a communicable
disease; or
(b) Order that two appropriate specimens be taken from the
decedent who likely exposed the petitioner, or the person on whose
behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable disease and be
submitted to a local hospital or medical laboratory for testing for
exposure to the communicable disease.
 The local hospital or medical laboratory shall perform the test in
accordance with generally accepted medical practices and shall
disclose the results of the test in the manner set forth in
NRS 629.069.

Section 7:
4. If a judge or a justice of the peace enters an order pursuant to
this section, the judge or justice of the peace may authorize the
designated health care officer or the person designated by the
employer or public agency to document and verify likely exposure
to a communicable disease to sign the name of the judge or justice
of the peace on a duplicate order. Such a duplicate order shall be
deemed to be an order of the court. As soon as practicable after the
duplicate order is signed, the duplicate order must be returned to the
judge or justice of the peace who authorized the signing of it and
must indicate on its face the judge or justice of the peace to whom it
is to be returned. The judge or justice of the peace, upon receiving
the returned order, shall endorse the order with his or her name and
enter the date on which the order was returned. Any failure of the
judge or justice of the peace to make such an endorsement and entry
does not in and of itself invalidate the order.

Section 8:
5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 629.069, all records
submitted to the court in connection with a petition filed pursuant to
this section and any proceedings concerning the petition are
confidential and the judge or justice of the peace shall order the
records and any record of the proceedings to be sealed and to be
opened for inspection only upon an order of the court for good cause
shown.

Section 9:
6. A court may establish rules to allow a judge or justice of the
peace to conduct a hearing or issue an order pursuant to this section

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 24–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; providing for the
certification and regulation of emergency medical
responders; prescribing certain duties and authority of an
emergency medical responder; prohibiting a person from
representing himself or herself as an emergency medical
responder without a valid certification; applying certain legal
protections for emergency medical services to emergency
medical responders; authorizing the collection of certain data
from an applicant for the renewal of a certificate as an
emergency medical responder; requiring the reporting of
certain data concerning veterans who apply for and receive
certification as an emergency medical responder; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the certification and regulation of emergency medical
technicians, advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics: (1) in a
county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), the
district board of health; or (2) in a county whose population is less than 700,000
(currently all counties other than Clark County), the State Board of Health and the
Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.077, 450B.130, 450B.180, 450B.1905-450B.1975)
Existing regulations provide for the certification of emergency medical responders.
(NAC 450B.355) Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 of this bill codify into law provisions for
the certification and regulation of emergency medical responders by the same
entities responsible for certifying and regulating emergency medical technicians,
advanced emergency medical technicians and paramedics. Section 2 of this bill
defines the term “emergency medical responder.” Section 3 of this bill applies the
definition set forth in section 2 to the provisions governing emergency medical
services.
Section 10 of this bill prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as
an emergency medical responder unless the person holds a valid certification as an
emergency medical responder. A person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a
misdemeanor and is also subject to administrative penalties. (NRS 450B.900)
Sections 1, 5, 7 and 11-28 of this bill make various revisions so that
emergency medical responders are treated similarly to emergency medical
technicians with regard to: (1) workplace safety, legal protections and benefits; (2)
the submission of written nominations by employee organizations for appointment
to the Committee on Emergency Medical Services; (3) the applicability of
provisions governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment; (4) the authority
to administer auto-injectable epinephrine and opioid antagonists; (5) the collection
of certain data; (6) legal protections for certain providers of health care who
provide instruction to emergency medical personnel at the scene of an emergency
or while transporting a sick or injured person; (7) the staffing of certain facilities;
and (8) certain other provisions governing reporting and the retention of records.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 441A.195 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
441A.195 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 259.047, a
law enforcement officer, correctional officer, emergency medical
attendant, firefighter, county coroner or medical examiner or any of
their employees or volunteers, any other person who is employed by
or is a volunteer for an agency of criminal justice or any other public
employee or volunteer for a public agency who, in the course of his
or her official duties, comes into contact with human blood or
bodily fluids, or the employer of such a person or the public agency
for which the person volunteers, may petition a court for an order
requiring the testing of a person or decedent for exposure to a
communicable disease if:
(a) The officer, emergency medical attendant, firefighter, county
coroner or medical examiner or their employee or volunteer, other
person employed by or volunteering for an agency of criminal
justice or other public employee or volunteer for a public agency
was likely exposed to a communicable disease; and
(b) Testing of the person or decedent is necessary to determine
the appropriate treatment for the officer, emergency medical
attendant, firefighter, county coroner, medical examiner, employee
or volunteer.
2. When possible, before filing a petition pursuant to
subsection 1, the person, employer or public agency for which the
person volunteers, and who is petitioning shall submit information
concerning the likely exposure to a communicable disease to the
designated health care officer for the employer or public agency or,
if there is no designated health care officer, the person designated by
the employer or public agency to document and verify likely
exposure to communicable diseases, for verification that there was
substantial exposure. Each designated health care officer or person
designated by an employer or public agency to document and verify
likely exposure to communicable diseases shall establish guidelines
based on current scientific information to determine substantial
exposure.
3. A court shall promptly hear a petition filed pursuant to
subsection 1 and determine whether there is probable cause to
believe that a likely transfer of blood or other bodily fluids occurred
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
between the person who filed the petition or on whose behalf the
petition was filed and the person or decedent who likely exposed
him or her to a communicable disease. If the court determines that
such probable cause exists, the court shall:
(a) Order the person who likely exposed the petitioner, or the
person on whose behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable
disease to submit two appropriate specimens to a local hospital or
medical laboratory for testing for exposure to a communicable
disease; or
(b) Order that two appropriate specimens be taken from the
decedent who likely exposed the petitioner, or the person on whose
behalf the petition was filed, to a communicable disease and be
submitted to a local hospital or medical laboratory for testing for
exposure to the communicable disease.
 The local hospital or medical laboratory shall perform the test in
accordance with generally accepted medical practices and shall
disclose the results of the test in the manner set forth in
NRS 629.069.
4. If a judge or a justice of the peace enters an order pursuant to
this section, the judge or justice of the peace may authorize the
designated health care officer or the person designated by the
employer or public agency to document and verify likely exposure
to a communicable disease to sign the name of the judge or justice
of the peace on a duplicate order. Such a duplicate order shall be
deemed to be an order of the court. As soon as practicable after the
duplicate order is signed, the duplicate order must be returned to the
judge or justice of the peace who authorized the signing of it and
must indicate on its face the judge or justice of the peace to whom it
is to be returned. The judge or justice of the peace, upon receiving
the returned order, shall endorse the order with his or her name and
enter the date on which the order was returned. Any failure of the
judge or justice of the peace to make such an endorsement and entry
does not in and of itself invalidate the order.
5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 629.069, all records
submitted to the court in connection with a petition filed pursuant to
this section and any proceedings concerning the petition are
confidential and the judge or justice of the peace shall order the
records and any record of the proceedings to be sealed and to be
opened for inspection only upon an order of the court for good cause
shown.
6. A court may establish rules to allow a judge or justice of the
peace to conduct a hearing or issue an order pursuant to this section
by electronic or telephonic means.
