Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners or a governing body
2 of an incorporated city, with certain exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or
3 proper to address matters of local concern for the effective operation of county or
4 city government, as applicable, whether or not the powers are expressly granted to
5 the board or governing body. (NRS 244.146, 268.0035) Existing law defines
6 “matter of local concern” to include planning, zoning, development and
7 redevelopment. (NRS 244.143, 268.003) Sections 2 and 6 of this bill eliminate
8 planning, zoning, development and redevelopment from the definition of “matter of
9 local concern.” As a result, the board of county commissioners or the governing
10 body of a city will not have authority to regulate planning, zoning, development
11 and redevelopment as a matter of local concern.
12 Sections 1 and 5 of this bill prohibit a board of county commissioners or the
13 governing body of an incorporated city from enacting any ordinance or measure
14 that imposes rent control.
15 Existing law sets forth certain powers and duties of governing bodies of cities
16 and counties relating to planning and zoning. (Chapter 278 of NRS) Sections 9-14
17 of this bill impose certain restrictions on those powers and duties. Section 9
18 requires notwithstanding any health, safety, building or fire code adopted by the
19 governing body, each governing body of a city or county to, by ordinance,
20 authorize: (1) single-staircase apartment buildings of not more than five stories; and
21 (2) single-room occupancy housing.
22 Section 10: (1) prohibits a governing body of a city or county from adopting an
23 ordinance that prohibits multi-family housing or mixed-use development in any
24 area zoned for commercial use; and (2) requires a governing body to authorize by
25 ordinance the conversion of any commercial building into multi-family housing.
26 Section 11 requires a governing body of a city or county to authorize, in any
27 area that is zoned for residential use, the development of multi-family housing.
28 Section 12 prohibits the governing body of a city or county from imposing any
29 of the following restrictions on the zoning or development of residential housing:
30 (1) minimum parking requirements; (2) height restrictions; (3) minimum lot size;
31 (4) setback requirements; and (5) limitations on square footage. Section 12 also
32 prohibits a governing body from limiting residential or commercial development by
33 creating any urban growth boundary.
34 Section 13 requires each governing body of a county and each governing body
35 of a city to adopt an ordinance to authorize, under certain circumstances, the owner
36 of a single-family residential property to add an accessory dwelling unit to the
37 single family-residential property.
38 Section 14 requires each governing body of a county and each governing body
39 of a city to establish an expedited process for the by-right development of
40 residential housing, including multi-family housing. The expedited process must
41 provide that any proposed project for the development of residential housing will
42 be approved by the county or city, as applicable, without any discretionary review
43 or discretionary approval if the proposed project is consistent with all applicable
44 zoning ordinances, building codes, housing codes and other applicable ordinances
45 and codes.
46 Section 18 of this bill eliminates the authority for a governing body to prohibit
47 factory-built housing in a specified area if the area contains a building, structure or
48 other object having a special character or special historical interest or value.
49 (NRS 278.0209)
50 Existing law requires the governing body of a county whose population is
51 100,000 or more (currently only Clark and Washoe Counties) or the governing
52 body of a city whose population is 150,000 or more (currently the cities of
53 Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and Reno) to regulate tiny houses,
54 including: (1) designating at least one zoning district in which a tiny house may be
-
*AB443*

– 3 –
55 located and classified as an accessory dwelling unit; (2) designating at least one
56 zoning district in which a tiny house may be located and classified as a single-
57 family residential unit; and (3) designating at least one zoning district in which a
58 tiny house may be located in a tiny house park. (NRS 278.253) Section 23 of this
59 bill provides instead that in an ordinance relating to the zoning of land adopted or
60 amended by such a governing body the definition of “single-family residence” must
61 include tiny houses. Section 23 applies to all counties and cities regardless of
62 population.
63 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the limitation of
64 the authority of the governing body of a city or county to restrict minimum lot size.
65 Subject to certain limitations, existing law authorizes the governing body of a
66 county or city to: (1) regulate all matters relating to the construction, maintenance
67 and safety of buildings, structures and property within the county; and (2) adopt
68 any necessary building, electrical, housing, plumbing or safety code. (NRS
69 244.3675, 268.413) Sections 4 and 7 of this bill provide that such authority is also
70 subject to the limitations set forth in sections 9-14.
71 Existing law authorizes and empowers the governing bodies of cities and
72 counties to regulate and restrict the improvement of land and to control the location
73 and soundness of structures. (NRS 278.020) Section 15 of this bill provides that
74 such restrictions, regulations and control must comply with any restriction on the
75 powers of cities and counties set forth in certain provisions of law.
76 Existing law sets forth the requirements for a master plan, which may be made
77 the basis for the physical development of a city or county, as applicable. (NRS
78 278.160) Section 21 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 9-14 are an
79 exception to this authority.
80 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, that in a county whose
81 population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe
82 County) any provision of the master plan governs any action taken in regard to an
83 application for development. (NRS 278.0284) Section 20 of this bill provides
84 instead that any provision of the master plan that is not consistent with the
85 provisions of sections 9-14 does not govern any action taken in regard to an
86 application for development.
87 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to divide the
88 city, county or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
89 best suited to carry out provisions of law relating to planning and zoning. Within
90 the zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the erection,
91 construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or
92 land. (NRS 278.250) Section 22 of this bill provides exceptions to the powers and
93 duties to account for the limitations on the planning and zoning powers set forth
94 sections 9-14.
95 Sections 26-60 of this bill make changes to each existing city charter to account
96 for the limitations set forth in sections 7 and 9-14 on the power of the governing
97 body of a city to adopt certain building codes and regulate planning and zoning.
98 Section 61 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Housing Division of the
99 Department of Business and Industry to appoint a task force to study issues relating
100 to housing during the 2025-2026 interim.
101 Section 62 of this bill voids any ordinance, regulation, building code, housing
102 code or fire code enacted or adopted by a county or city before, on or after
103 October 1, 2025, which conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
