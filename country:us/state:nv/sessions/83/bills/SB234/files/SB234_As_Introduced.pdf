AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to provide
certain limited coverage to certain persons who would
otherwise be ineligible for Medicaid because of their
immigration status; prescribing the scope and limitations
of such coverage; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires Medicaid to provide to certain aliens, including
2 aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States, limited coverage for health
3 care services that are necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. (42 U.S.C.
4 § 1396b(v)(2); 42 C.F.R. § 440.255) Section 1 of this bill prescribes specific
5 requirements governing such coverage under Medicaid in this State. Specifically,
6 section 1 provides that such coverage must consist of coverage for: (1) emergency
7 medical transportation services directly relating to the treatment of the emergency
8 medical condition; (2) care to treat the emergency medical condition provided in an
9 emergency room or similar setting in a hospital or an independent center for
10 emergency medical care; and (3) certain inpatient services relating to the treatment
11 of the emergency medical condition. Additionally, section 1 provides limited
12 coverage for certain care to treat renal disease and cancer in certain circumstances,
13 if the Department of Health and Human Services grants prior approval for such care
14 based on the medical necessity of the care. Section 1 also provides limited
15 coverage in certain circumstances for continuing care relating to an emergency
16 medical condition that is provided in a facility for skilled nursing, or other similar
17 type of facility, if: (1) such care is necessary to prevent the condition of the person
-

– 2 –
18 from becoming an emergency medical condition; and (2) the Department grants
19 prior approval for such care based on the medical necessity of the care.
20 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
21 Department to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as other
22 provisions relating to Medicaid.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 422 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:

4 available, the Director shall include under Medicaid pursuant to
5 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)(2) and 42 C.F.R. § 440.255 coverage for care
6 that is necessary to treat an emergency medical condition of a
7 resident of this State who would otherwise be ineligible for
8 Medicaid solely because of his or her immigration status. The
9 coverage provided pursuant to this section must consist of
10 coverage for:
11 (a) Emergency medical transportation services directly relating
12 to the treatment of the emergency medical condition;
13 (b) Care to treat the emergency medical condition provided in

20 her emergency medical condition, if the inpatient services directly
21 relate to the treatment of the emergency medical condition;
22 (d) If approved by the Department pursuant to subsection 3:
23 (1) Care that is provided in a facility for skilled nursing or
24 other similar facility for treatment in a community setting

26 person was receiving inpatient services, if the care directly relates
27 to the emergency medical condition for which the person received
28 care before the discharge;
29 (2) Dialysis provided in a hospital or a facility for the
30 treatment of irreversible renal disease;
31 (3) Care, including, without limitation, surgery,
32 chemotherapy and radiation therapy, that is necessary to treat

2 (e) Any follow-up services that are included within a payment
3 for a service described in paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive.
4 2. The Director shall not include under Medicaid coverage
5 pursuant to this section for any care or service not described in
6 subsection 1, including, without limitation:

9 provider of health care as part of the care or treatment described
10 in subsection 1;

29 3. The Department may not provide coverage under Medicaid
30 pursuant to this section for the care described in paragraph (d) of
31 subsection 1 unless the Department determines, before the care
32 being rendered, that such care is medically necessary and
33 appropriate, based on the condition of the person to whom the
34 care may be provided. To provide coverage for the care described
35 in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (d) of subsection 1, the
36 Department must additionally determine that the care is necessary
37 to prevent the condition of the person from rapidly becoming an
38 emergency medical condition.
