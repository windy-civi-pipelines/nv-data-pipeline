AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to provide certain limited
coverage to certain persons who would otherwise be ineligible for
Medicaid because of their immigration status; prescribing the scope
and limitations of such coverage; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to seek an increase to rates of
reimbursement under Medicaid for services relating to certain
childhood diseases; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires Medicaid to provide to certain aliens, including aliens who
2 are not lawfully present in the United States, limited coverage for health care services that are
3 necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. (42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)(2); 42 C.F.R. §
4 440.255) Section 1 of this bill prescribes specific requirements governing such coverage
5 under Medicaid in this State [.] for persons who are less than 21 years of age. Specifically,
6 section 1 provides that such coverage must consist of coverage for: (1) emergency medical
7 transportation services directly relating to the treatment of the emergency medical condition;
8 (2) care to treat the emergency medical condition provided in an emergency room or similar
9 setting in a hospital or an independent center for emergency medical care; and (3) certain
10 inpatient services relating to the treatment of the emergency medical condition. Additionally,
11 section 1 provides limited coverage for certain care to treat renal disease and cancer in certain
12 circumstances, if the Department of Health and Human Services grants prior approval for such
13 care based on the medical necessity of the care. Section 1 also provides limited coverage in
14 certain circumstances for continuing care relating to an emergency medical condition that is
15 provided in a facility for skilled nursing, or other similar type of facility, if: (1) such care is
16 necessary to prevent the condition of the person from becoming an emergency medical
17 condition; and (2) the Department grants prior approval for such care based on the medical
18 necessity of the care.

Senate Amendment No. 352 to Senate Bill No. 234 Page 4

20 Department to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as other provisions
21 relating to Medicaid.
22 Section 2.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to: (1) identify the
23 most common services provided by clinics and hospitals in this State to treat pediatric
24 cancer and rare childhood diseases; and (2) apply to the United States Secretary of
25 Health and Human Services to increase the rate of reimbursement under Medicaid for
26 each service identified.
