AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to provide

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law requires Medicaid to provide to certain aliens, including
2 aliens who are not lawfully present in the United States, limited coverage for health
3 care services that are necessary to treat an emergency medical condition. (42 U.S.C.
4 § 1396b(v)(2); 42 C.F.R. § 440.255) Section 1 of this bill prescribes specific
5 requirements governing such coverage under Medicaid in this State for persons

7 coverage must consist of coverage for: (1) emergency medical transportation

9 care to treat the emergency medical condition provided in an emergency room or
10 similar setting in a hospital or an independent center for emergency medical care;
11 and (3) certain inpatient services relating to the treatment of the emergency medical
12 condition. Additionally, section 1 provides limited coverage for certain care to treat

18 necessary to prevent the condition of the person from becoming an emergency
19 medical condition; and (2) the Department grants prior approval for such care based
20 on the medical necessity of the care.
21 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
22 Department to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as other
23 provisions relating to Medicaid.
24 Section 2.5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to: (1) identify
25 the most common services provided by clinics and hospitals in this State to treat
26 pediatric cancer and rare childhood diseases; and (2) apply to the United States
