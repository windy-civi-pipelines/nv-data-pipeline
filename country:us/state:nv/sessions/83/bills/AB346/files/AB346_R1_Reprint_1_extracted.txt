Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal
2 condition to refuse life-resuscitating or life-sustaining treatment in certain
3 circumstances. (NRS 449A.400-449A.581, 450B.400-450B.590) Sections 5-33 of
4 this bill authorize a patient, under certain circumstances, to self-administer a
5 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. Section 14 defines
6 “practitioner” to mean a physician, osteopathic physician or advanced practice
7 registered nurse. Sections 6-13, 15 and 16 define other relevant terms. Section 17
8 authorizes a patient to request that his or her attending practitioner prescribe a
9 medication that is designed to end his or her life if the patient: (1) is at least 18
10 years of age; (2) has been diagnosed with a terminal condition by at least two
11 practitioners; (3) has made an informed and voluntary decision to end his or her
12 own life; (4) is mentally capable of making such a decision; and (5) is not
13 requesting the medication because of coercion, deception or undue influence.
14 Section 18 prescribes certain requirements concerning the manner in which a
15 patient may request a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient,
16 including that the patient make two verbal requests and one written request for the
17 medication, and that the written request for the medication be signed by a witness.
18 Section 19 prescribes the form for the written request for the medication. Section
19 20 imposes certain requirements before a practitioner is authorized to prescribe a
20 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient, including that the
21 practitioner: (1) inform the patient of his or her right to revoke a request for the
22 medication at any time; (2) determine and verify that the patient meets
23 the requirements for making such a request; (3) discuss certain relevant factors with
24 the patient, including the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient and alternative
25 options for care; (4) refer the patient to a consulting practitioner who can confirm
26 the diagnosis, prognosis and mental capability of the patient and that the patient has
27 not been coerced or unduly influenced; and (5) instruct the patient against self-
28 administering the medication in public. Section 21 requires a practitioner who
29 determines that a patient who has requested a prescription for a medication that is
30 designed to end his or her life may not be mentally capable to refer the patient to a
31 qualified mental health professional and to receive confirmation about the patient’s
32 mental capability.
33 Section 22: (1) prescribes procedures for the issuance of a prescription for a
34 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient; and (2) provides that only
35 an attending practitioner or a pharmacist may dispense such a medication. Section
36 22.5 of this bill prescribes the manner in which the attending practitioner may bill
37 the patient or the insurer of the patient for diagnosing the condition of the patient
38 and prescribing the medication. Section 23 prohibits an attending practitioner from
39 prescribing a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient based solely on
40 the age or disability of the patient. Section 24 requires certain providers of health
41 care to include certain information concerning requests and prescriptions for and
42 the dispensing of a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient in the
43 medical record of the patient. If a patient who has requested a medication that is
44 designed to end the life of a patient transfers care to another practitioner or health
45 care facility, sections 24 and 31 require the practitioner or health care facility that
46 previously provided care to the patient to forward the patient’s medical records to
47 the new practitioner or health care facility. Section 27 prescribes certain
48 information that must be reported by an attending practitioner to the Division of
49 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services
50 relating to a patient who has been prescribed or self-administered such a
51 medication. Section 28 requires the Division to compile an annual report
52 concerning the implementation of the provisions of this bill authorizing a patient to
53 request a prescription for a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient.
-
*AB346_R1*
– 3 –
54 Sections 27, 40 and 43 of this bill provide that such information is otherwise
55 confidential when reported to the Division.
56 Section 25 authorizes a patient, at any time, to revoke a request for a
57 medication that is designed to end his or her life. Sections 26 and 35 of this bill
58 provide that only the patient to whom a medication that is designed to end his or
59 her life is prescribed may administer the medication. Section 26 establishes
60 requirements for the disposal of any unused portion of the medication.
61 Section 33 makes certain persons exempt from professional discipline and
62 immune from civil and criminal penalties and provides that such persons do not
63 violate any applicable standard of care for taking actions authorized by this bill to
64 assist a patient in acquiring a medication that is designed to end the life of the
65 patient. Section 33.3 of this bill requires a person who administers emergency
66 medical services to treat a prescription for a medication that is designed to end the
67 life of a patient as a written do-not-resuscitate order for the purpose of withholding
68 life-sustaining treatment. Section 33.6 of this bill requires a person who administers
69 emergency medical services who responds to a person who has self-administered a
70 medication that is designed to end his or her life to indicate “medical aid in dying”
71 in any report concerning the incident. Section 33.1 of this bill makes a conforming
72 change to include a patient who has self-administered a medication designed to end
73 his or her life in the definition of “qualified patient” for the purpose of provisions
74 governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment. Section 29 provides that a
75 death resulting from the self-administration of a medication that is designed to end
76 the life of a patient is not mercy killing, euthanasia, assisted suicide, suicide or
77 homicide when done in accordance with the provisions of this bill, and section 2 of
78 this bill requires a death certificate to list the terminal condition of the patient as the
79 cause of death of the patient. However, section 1.5 of this bill requires a death
80 certificate to include a box that may be marked to indicate that a patient died from
81 the self-administration of a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient,
82 and section 2 requires the death certificate of such a patient to indicate that the
83 patient died in that manner through a mark in that box. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill
84 provide that a coroner, coroner’s deputy or local health officer is not required to
85 certify the cause of such a death. Section 42 of this bill: (1) authorizes a coroner to
86 make an appropriate investigation after discovering that a person has self-
87 administered a medication designed to end the life of the person, to the extent
88 necessary to determine the cause of the terminal condition with which the person
89 was diagnosed; and (2) requires a coroner to cease such an investigation after
90 determining that the terminal condition resulted from a natural cause. Section 41 of
91 this bill makes a conforming change to revise certain internal references.
92 Sections 30 and 38 of this bill prohibit a person from preventing or requiring a
93 person to make or revoke a request for a medication that is designed to end the life
94 of the person as a condition to receiving health care or as a condition in an
95 agreement, contract or will.
96 Section 31 clarifies that a practitioner is not required to prescribe a medication
97 that is designed to end the life of a patient and remains responsible for treating the
98 patient’s pain. However, if a patient who is diagnosed with a terminal condition
99 requests information concerning the prescription and self-administration of a
100 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient, section 31 requires a
101 practitioner to provide that information or facilitate the transfer of the patient to
102 another provider of health care. Section 31 also provides that a pharmacist is not
103 required to fill a prescription for or dispense such a medication. Section 32
104 authorizes the owner or operator of a health care facility to prohibit an employee or
105 independent contractor of the health care facility or any person who provides
106 services on the premises of the health care facility from providing any services
107 relating to prescribing a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient
108 while acting within the scope of his or her employment or contract with the facility
-
*AB346_R1*

109 or while on the premises of the facility. Section 33 prohibits a health care facility or
110 provider of health care from taking certain actions against an employee or
111 independent contractor who: (1) provides accurate, scientific information
112 concerning end-of-life care to a patient; or (2) facilitates the prescription or self-
113 administration of a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient.
114 Sections 34-37 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a practitioner or
115 pharmacist is authorized to dispense a medication that is designed to end the life of
116 a patient that is a controlled substance or dangerous drug and a patient may self-
117 administer such a medication in accordance with other provisions governing
118 medications designed to end the life of a patient.
119 Section 39 of this bill provides that a proposed protected person shall not be
120 deemed to be in need of a general or special guardian solely because the proposed
121 protected person requested a medication that is designed to end his or her life or
122 revoked such a request.
123 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill prohibit insurers from conditioning life
124 insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits or the payment of claims on
125 whether the insured makes, fails to make or revokes a request for a medication that
126 is designed to end the life of the insured or self-administers such a medication.
127 Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect this prohibition on a
128 policy of group life insurance.
1 WHEREAS, A mentally capable adult patient should have the
2 right to self-determination concerning his or her health care
3 decisions based on his or her values, beliefs or personal preferences;
4 and
5 WHEREAS, It is important that patients have the full range of
6 options for their care, especially at the end of their lives; and
7 WHEREAS, Patients with a terminal illness may undergo
8 unremitting pain, agonizing discomfort and a sudden, continuing
9 and irreversible reduction in their quality of life; and
10 WHEREAS, The availability of medical aid in dying provides an
11 additional palliative care option for persons with a terminal illness
12 who seek to retain their autonomy and some level of control over
13 the progression of their disease or ease unnecessary pain and
14 suffering; and
15 WHEREAS, The integration of medical aid in dying into standard
16 end-of-life care has demonstrably improved such care by
17 contributing to better conversations between providers of health care
18 and patients, earlier and more appropriate enrollment in hospice care
19 and better training concerning palliative care for providers; and
20 WHEREAS, Patient-directed care respects and responds to the
21 decisions, preferences, needs and values of individual patients,
22 ensures that the values of patients direct all clinical decisions
23 concerning their care and ensures that patients are fully informed of
24 and able to access the options for care that they desire; now,
25 therefore,

1 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
2 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
3 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
4 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

6 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
7 electronically, the confidential information from the information
8 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
9 confidential.
10 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
11 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
12 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
13 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
14 means of an electronic medium if:
15 (a) The public record:
16 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
17 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
18 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

20 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
21 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
22 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
23 information that is not otherwise confidential.
24 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
25 has legal custody or control of a public record:
26 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
27 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
28 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
29 medium.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
31 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
32 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
33 or herself.
34 Sec. 41. NRS 259.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 259.010 1. Every county in this State constitutes a coroner’s
36 district, except a county where a coroner is appointed pursuant to
37 the provisions of NRS 244.163.
38 2. The provisions of this chapter, except NRS 259.025,
39 259.045, 259.047, 259.049, subsections [3] 4 and [4] 5 of NRS
40 259.050, NRS 259.053 and 259.150 to 259.180, inclusive, do not

42 provisions of NRS 244.163.
43 Sec. 42. NRS 259.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 259.050 1. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is
45 informed that a person has been killed, has committed suicide or has
-
*AB346_R1*
– 30 –
1 suddenly died under such circumstances as to afford reasonable
2 ground to suspect that the death has been occasioned by unnatural
3 means, the coroner shall make an appropriate investigation.
4 2. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is informed or
5 otherwise discovers that a person has self-administered a
6 medication designed to end his or her life pursuant to sections 5 to
7 33, inclusive, of this act, the coroner:
8 (a) May make an appropriate investigation to the extent
9 necessary to determine that the cause of the terminal condition
10 with which the person was diagnosed; and
11 (b) Must cease investigating the death after determining that
12 the terminal condition with which the person was diagnosed
13 resulted from a natural cause.
14 3. In all cases where it is apparent or can be reasonably inferred
15 that the death may have been caused by a criminal act, the coroner
16 or the coroner’s deputy shall notify the district attorney of the
17 county where the inquiry is made, and the district attorney shall
18 make an investigation with the assistance of the coroner. If the
19 sheriff is not ex officio the coroner, the coroner shall also notify the
20 sheriff, and the district attorney and sheriff shall make
21 the investigation with the assistance of the coroner.
22 [3.] 4. If it is apparent to or can be reasonably inferred by the
23 coroner that a death may have been caused by drug use or
24 poisoning, the coroner shall cause a postmortem examination to be
25 performed on the decedent by a forensic pathologist unless the death
26 occurred following a hospitalization stay of 24 hours or more.
27 [4.] 5. A coroner may issue a subpoena for the production of
28 any document, record or material that is directly related or believed
29 to contain evidence related to an investigation by the coroner.
30 [5.] 6. The holding of a coroner’s inquest is within the sound
31 discretion of the district attorney or district judge of the county. An
32 inquest need not be conducted in any case of death manifestly
33 occasioned by natural cause, suicide, accident, motor vehicle crash
34 or when it is publicly known that the death was caused by a person
35 already in custody, but an inquest must be held unless the district
36 attorney or a district judge certifies that no inquest is required.
37 [6.] 7. If an inquest is to be held, the district attorney shall call
38 upon a justice of the peace of the county to preside over it. The
39 justice of the peace shall summon three persons qualified by law to
40 serve as jurors, to appear before the justice of the peace forthwith at
41 the place where the body is or such other place within the county as
42 may be designated by him or her to inquire into the cause of death.
43 [7.] 8. A single inquest may be held with respect to more than
44 one death, where all the deaths were occasioned by a common
45 cause.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal
2 condition to refuse life-resuscitating or life-sustaining treatment in certain
3 circumstances. (NRS 449A.400-449A.581, 450B.400-450B.590) Sections 5-33 of
4 this bill authorize a patient, under certain circumstances, to self-administer a
5 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. Section 14 defines
6 “practitioner” to mean a physician, osteopathic physician or advanced practice
7 registered nurse. Sections 6-13, 15 and 16 define other relevant terms. Section 17
8 authorizes a patient to request that his or her attending practitioner prescribe a
9 medication that is designed to end his or her life if the patient: (1) is at least 18
10 years of age; (2) has been diagnosed with a terminal condition by at least two
11 practitioners; (3) has made an informed and voluntary decision to end his or her
12 own life; (4) is mentally capable of making such a decision; and (5) is not
13 requesting the medication because of coercion, deception or undue influence.
14 Section 18 prescribes certain requirements concerning the manner in which a
15 patient may request a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient,
16 including that the patient make two verbal requests and one written request for the
17 medication, and that the written request for the medication be signed by a witness.
18 Section 19 prescribes the form for the written request for the medication. Section
19 20 imposes certain requirements before a practitioner is authorized to prescribe a
20 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient, including that the
21 practitioner: (1) inform the patient of his or her right to revoke a request for the
22 medication at any time; (2) determine and verify that the patient meets
23 the requirements for making such a request; (3) discuss certain relevant factors with
24 the patient, including the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient and alternative
25 options for care; (4) refer the patient to a consulting practitioner who can confirm
26 the diagnosis, prognosis and mental capability of the patient and that the patient has
27 not been coerced or unduly influenced; and (5) instruct the patient against self-
28 administering the medication in public. Section 21 requires a practitioner who
29 determines that a patient who has requested a prescription for a medication that is
30 designed to end his or her life may not be mentally capable to refer the patient to a
31 qualified mental health professional and to receive confirmation about the patient’s
32 mental capability.
33 Section 22: (1) prescribes procedures for the issuance of a prescription for a
34 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient; and (2) provides that only
35 an attending practitioner or a pharmacist may dispense such a medication. Section
36 22.5 of this bill prescribes the manner in which the attending practitioner may bill
37 the patient or the insurer of the patient for diagnosing the condition of the patient
38 and prescribing the medication. Section 23 prohibits an attending practitioner from
39 prescribing a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient based solely on
40 the age or disability of the patient. Section 24 requires certain providers of health
41 care to include certain information concerning requests and prescriptions for and
42 the dispensing of a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient in the
43 medical record of the patient. If a patient who has requested a medication that is
44 designed to end the life of a patient transfers care to another practitioner or health
45 care facility, sections 24 and 31 require the practitioner or health care facility that
46 previously provided care to the patient to forward the patient’s medical records to
47 the new practitioner or health care facility. Section 27 prescribes certain
48 information that must be reported by an attending practitioner to the Division of
49 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services
50 relating to a patient who has been prescribed or self-administered such a
51 medication. Section 28 requires the Division to compile an annual report
52 concerning the implementation of the provisions of this bill authorizing a patient to
53 request a prescription for a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient.
-
*AB346_R1*

– 3 –
54 Sections 27, 40 and 43 of this bill provide that such information is otherwise
55 confidential when reported to the Division.
56 Section 25 authorizes a patient, at any time, to revoke a request for a
57 medication that is designed to end his or her life. Sections 26 and 35 of this bill
58 provide that only the patient to whom a medication that is designed to end his or
59 her life is prescribed may administer the medication. Section 26 establishes
60 requirements for the disposal of any unused portion of the medication.
61 Section 33 makes certain persons exempt from professional discipline and
62 immune from civil and criminal penalties and provides that such persons do not
63 violate any applicable standard of care for taking actions authorized by this bill to
64 assist a patient in acquiring a medication that is designed to end the life of the
65 patient. Section 33.3 of this bill requires a person who administers emergency
66 medical services to treat a prescription for a medication that is designed to end the
67 life of a patient as a written do-not-resuscitate order for the purpose of withholding
68 life-sustaining treatment. Section 33.6 of this bill requires a person who administers
69 emergency medical services who responds to a person who has self-administered a
70 medication that is designed to end his or her life to indicate “medical aid in dying”
71 in any report concerning the incident. Section 33.1 of this bill makes a conforming
72 change to include a patient who has self-administered a medication designed to end
73 his or her life in the definition of “qualified patient” for the purpose of provisions
74 governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment. Section 29 provides that a
75 death resulting from the self-administration of a medication that is designed to end
76 the life of a patient is not mercy killing, euthanasia, assisted suicide, suicide or
77 homicide when done in accordance with the provisions of this bill, and section 2 of
78 this bill requires a death certificate to list the terminal condition of the patient as the
79 cause of death of the patient. However, section 1.5 of this bill requires a death
80 certificate to include a box that may be marked to indicate that a patient died from
81 the self-administration of a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient,
82 and section 2 requires the death certificate of such a patient to indicate that the
83 patient died in that manner through a mark in that box. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill
84 provide that a coroner, coroner’s deputy or local health officer is not required to
85 certify the cause of such a death. Section 42 of this bill: (1) authorizes a coroner to
86 make an appropriate investigation after discovering that a person has self-
87 administered a medication designed to end the life of the person, to the extent
88 necessary to determine the cause of the terminal condition with which the person
89 was diagnosed; and (2) requires a coroner to cease such an investigation after
90 determining that the terminal condition resulted from a natural cause. Section 41 of
91 this bill makes a conforming change to revise certain internal references.
92 Sections 30 and 38 of this bill prohibit a person from preventing or requiring a
93 person to make or revoke a request for a medication that is designed to end the life
94 of the person as a condition to receiving health care or as a condition in an
95 agreement, contract or will.
96 Section 31 clarifies that a practitioner is not required to prescribe a medication
97 that is designed to end the life of a patient and remains responsible for treating the
98 patient’s pain. However, if a patient who is diagnosed with a terminal condition
99 requests information concerning the prescription and self-administration of a
100 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient, section 31 requires a
101 practitioner to provide that information or facilitate the transfer of the patient to
102 another provider of health care. Section 31 also provides that a pharmacist is not
103 required to fill a prescription for or dispense such a medication. Section 32
104 authorizes the owner or operator of a health care facility to prohibit an employee or
105 independent contractor of the health care facility or any person who provides
106 services on the premises of the health care facility from providing any services
107 relating to prescribing a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient
108 while acting within the scope of his or her employment or contract with the facility
-
*AB346_R1*

– 4 –
109 or while on the premises of the facility. Section 33 prohibits a health care facility or
110 provider of health care from taking certain actions against an employee or
111 independent contractor who: (1) provides accurate, scientific information
112 concerning end-of-life care to a patient; or (2) facilitates the prescription or self-
113 administration of a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient.
114 Sections 34-37 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a practitioner or
115 pharmacist is authorized to dispense a medication that is designed to end the life of
116 a patient that is a controlled substance or dangerous drug and a patient may self-
117 administer such a medication in accordance with other provisions governing
118 medications designed to end the life of a patient.
119 Section 39 of this bill provides that a proposed protected person shall not be
120 deemed to be in need of a general or special guardian solely because the proposed
121 protected person requested a medication that is designed to end his or her life or
122 revoked such a request.
123 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill prohibit insurers from conditioning life
124 insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits or the payment of claims on
125 whether the insured makes, fails to make or revokes a request for a medication that
126 is designed to end the life of the insured or self-administers such a medication.
127 Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect this prohibition on a
128 policy of group life insurance.
1 WHEREAS, A mentally capable adult patient should have the
2 right to self-determination concerning his or her health care
3 decisions based on his or her values, beliefs or personal preferences;
4 and
5 WHEREAS, It is important that patients have the full range of
6 options for their care, especially at the end of their lives; and
7 WHEREAS, Patients with a terminal illness may undergo
8 unremitting pain, agonizing discomfort and a sudden, continuing
9 and irreversible reduction in their quality of life; and
10 WHEREAS, The availability of medical aid in dying provides an
11 additional palliative care option for persons with a terminal illness
12 who seek to retain their autonomy and some level of control over
13 the progression of their disease or ease unnecessary pain and
14 suffering; and
15 WHEREAS, The integration of medical aid in dying into standard
16 end-of-life care has demonstrably improved such care by
17 contributing to better conversations between providers of health care
18 and patients, earlier and more appropriate enrollment in hospice care
19 and better training concerning palliative care for providers; and
20 WHEREAS, Patient-directed care respects and responds to the
21 decisions, preferences, needs and values of individual patients,
22 ensures that the values of patients direct all clinical decisions
23 concerning their care and ensures that patients are fully informed of
24 and able to access the options for care that they desire; now,
25 therefore,

1 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
2 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
3 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or

11 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
12 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity

16 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
17 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
18 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

22 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
23 information that is not otherwise confidential.
24 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
25 has legal custody or control of a public record:
26 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

28 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
29 medium.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
31 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
32 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
33 or herself.
34 Sec. 41. NRS 259.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 259.010 1. Every county in this State constitutes a coroner’s
36 district, except a county where a coroner is appointed pursuant to
37 the provisions of NRS 244.163.
38 2. The provisions of this chapter, except NRS 259.025,
39 259.045, 259.047, 259.049, subsections [3] 4 and [4] 5 of NRS
40 259.050, NRS 259.053 and 259.150 to 259.180, inclusive, do not

42 provisions of NRS 244.163.
43 Sec. 42. NRS 259.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 259.050 1. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is
45 informed that a person has been killed, has committed suicide or has
-
*AB346_R1*

– 30 –
1 suddenly died under such circumstances as to afford reasonable
2 ground to suspect that the death has been occasioned by unnatural
3 means, the coroner shall make an appropriate investigation.
4 2. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is informed or
5 otherwise discovers that a person has self-administered a
6 medication designed to end his or her life pursuant to sections 5 to
7 33, inclusive, of this act, the coroner:
8 (a) May make an appropriate investigation to the extent
9 necessary to determine that the cause of the terminal condition
10 with which the person was diagnosed; and
11 (b) Must cease investigating the death after determining that
12 the terminal condition with which the person was diagnosed
13 resulted from a natural cause.
14 3. In all cases where it is apparent or can be reasonably inferred
15 that the death may have been caused by a criminal act, the coroner
16 or the coroner’s deputy shall notify the district attorney of the
17 county where the inquiry is made, and the district attorney shall
18 make an investigation with the assistance of the coroner. If the
19 sheriff is not ex officio the coroner, the coroner shall also notify the
20 sheriff, and the district attorney and sheriff shall make
21 the investigation with the assistance of the coroner.
22 [3.] 4. If it is apparent to or can be reasonably inferred by the
23 coroner that a death may have been caused by drug use or
24 poisoning, the coroner shall cause a postmortem examination to be
25 performed on the decedent by a forensic pathologist unless the death
26 occurred following a hospitalization stay of 24 hours or more.
27 [4.] 5. A coroner may issue a subpoena for the production of
28 any document, record or material that is directly related or believed
29 to contain evidence related to an investigation by the coroner.
30 [5.] 6. The holding of a coroner’s inquest is within the sound
31 discretion of the district attorney or district judge of the county. An
32 inquest need not be conducted in any case of death manifestly
33 occasioned by natural cause, suicide, accident, motor vehicle crash
34 or when it is publicly known that the death was caused by a person
35 already in custody, but an inquest must be held unless the district
36 attorney or a district judge certifies that no inquest is required.
37 [6.] 7. If an inquest is to be held, the district attorney shall call
38 upon a justice of the peace of the county to preside over it. The
39 justice of the peace shall summon three persons qualified by law to
40 serve as jurors, to appear before the justice of the peace forthwith at
41 the place where the body is or such other place within the county as
42 may be designated by him or her to inquire into the cause of death.
43 [7.] 8. A single inquest may be held with respect to more than
44 one death, where all the deaths were occasioned by a common
45 cause.

7 before, on or after the effective date of this act is void and
8 unenforceable.
9 Sec. 46. NRS 688B.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 688B.040 No policy of group life insurance shall be delivered
11 in this State unless it contains in substance the provisions set forth in
12 NRS 688B.040 to 688B.150, inclusive, and section 45 of this act or
13 provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner are more
14 favorable to the persons insured, or at least as favorable to the
15 persons insured and more favorable to the policyholder; except:
16 1. NRS 688B.100 to 688B.140, inclusive, do not apply to
17 policies issued to a creditor to insure debtors of such creditor;
18 2. The standard provisions required for individual life
19 insurance policies do not apply to group life insurance policies; and
20 3. If the group life insurance policy is on a plan of insurance
21 other than the term plan, it shall contain a nonforfeiture provision or
22 provisions which in the opinion of the Commissioner is or are
23 equitable to the insured persons and to the policyholder; but nothing
24 in this subsection shall be construed to require that group life
25 insurance policies contain the same nonforfeiture provisions as are
26 required for individual life insurance policies.
27 Sec. 47. Not later than 45 days after the effective date of this
28 act, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department
29 of Health and Human Services shall prescribe and make available
30 on an Internet website maintained by the Division the forms for
31 making the reports required by section 27 of this act.
32 Sec. 48. This act becomes effective upon passage and
33 approval.
