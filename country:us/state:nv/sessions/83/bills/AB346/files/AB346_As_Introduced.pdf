Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal
2 condition to refuse life-resuscitating or life-sustaining treatment in certain
3 circumstances. (NRS 449A.400-449A.581, 450B.400-450B.590) Sections 5-33 of
4 this bill authorize a patient, under certain circumstances, to self-administer a
5 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. Section 14 defines
6 “practitioner” to mean a physician, osteopathic physician or advanced practice
7 registered nurse. Sections 6-13, 15 and 16 define other relevant terms. Section 17
8 authorizes a patient to request that his or her attending practitioner prescribe a
9 medication that is designed to end his or her life if the patient: (1) is at least 18
10 years of age; (2) has been diagnosed with a terminal condition by at least two
11 practitioners; (3) has made an informed and voluntary decision to end his or her
12 own life; (4) is mentally capable of making such a decision; and (5) is not
13 requesting the medication because of coercion, deception or undue influence.
14 Section 18 prescribes certain requirements concerning the manner in which a
15 patient may request a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient,
16 including that the patient make two verbal requests and one written request for the
17 medication, and that the written request for the medication be signed by a witness.
18 Section 19 prescribes the form for the written request for the medication. Section
19 20 imposes certain requirements before a practitioner is authorized to prescribe a
20 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient, including that the
21 practitioner: (1) inform the patient of his or her right to revoke a request for the
22 medication at any time; (2) determine and verify that the patient meets
23 the requirements for making such a request; (3) discuss certain relevant factors with
24 the patient, including the diagnosis and prognosis of the patient and alternative
25 options for care; (4) refer the patient to a consulting practitioner who can confirm
26 the diagnosis, prognosis and mental capability of the patient and that the patient has
27 not been coerced or unduly influenced; and (5) instruct the patient against self-
28 administering the medication in public. Section 21 requires a practitioner who
29 determines that a patient who has requested a prescription for a medication that is
30 designed to end his or her life may not be mentally capable to refer the patient to a
31 qualified mental health professional and to receive confirmation about the patient’s
32 mental capability.
33 Section 22: (1) prescribes procedures for the issuance of a prescription for a
34 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient; and (2) provides that only
35 an attending practitioner or a pharmacist may dispense such a medication. Section
36 23 prohibits an attending practitioner from prescribing a medication that is designed
37 to end the life of a patient based solely on the age or disability of the patient.
38 Section 24 requires certain providers of health care to include certain information
39 concerning requests and prescriptions for and the dispensing of a medication that is
40 designed to end the life of a patient in the medical record of the patient. If a patient
41 who has requested a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient transfers
42 care to another practitioner or health care facility, sections 24 and 31 require the
43 practitioner or health care facility that previously provided care to the patient to
44 forward the patient’s medical records to the new practitioner or health care facility.
45 Section 27 prescribes certain information that must be reported by an attending
46 practitioner to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of
47 Health and Human Services relating to a patient who has been prescribed or self-
48 administered such a medication. Section 28 requires the Division to compile an
49 annual report concerning the implementation of the provisions of this bill
50 authorizing a patient to request a prescription for a medication that is designed to
51 end the life of the patient. Sections 27, 40 and 43 of this bill provide that such
52 information is otherwise confidential when reported to the Division.
53 Section 25 authorizes a patient, at any time, to revoke a request for a
54 medication that is designed to end his or her life. Sections 26 and 35 of this bill
-
*AB346*

– 3 –
55 provide that only the patient to whom a medication that is designed to end his or
56 her life is prescribed may administer the medication. Section 26 establishes
57 requirements for the disposal of any unused portion of the medication.
58 Section 33 makes certain persons exempt from professional discipline and
59 immune from civil and criminal penalties and provides that such persons do not
60 violate any applicable standard of care for taking actions authorized by this bill to
61 assist a patient in acquiring a medication that is designed to end the life of the
62 patient. Section 29 provides that a death resulting from the self-administration of a
63 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient is not mercy killing,
64 euthanasia, assisted suicide, suicide or homicide when done in accordance with the
65 provisions of this bill, and section 2 of this bill requires a death certificate to list the
66 terminal condition of the patient as the cause of death of the patient. Sections 1 and
67 3 of this bill provide that a coroner, coroner’s deputy or local health officer is not
68 required to certify the cause of such a death. Section 42 of this bill: (1) authorizes a
69 coroner to make an appropriate investigation after discovering that a person has
70 self-administered a medication designed to end the life of the person, to the extent
71 necessary to determine the cause of the terminal condition with which the person
72 was diagnosed; and (2) requires a coroner to cease such an investigation after
73 determining that the terminal condition resulted from a natural cause. Section 41 of
74 this bill makes a conforming change to revise certain internal references.
75 Sections 30 and 38 of this bill prohibit a person from preventing or requiring a
76 person to make or revoke a request for a medication that is designed to end the life
77 of the person as a condition to receiving health care or as a condition in an
78 agreement, contract or will.
79 Section 31 clarifies that a practitioner is not required to prescribe a medication
80 that is designed to end the life of a patient and remains responsible for treating the
81 patient’s pain. However, if a patient who is diagnosed with a terminal condition
82 requests information concerning the prescription and self-administration of a
83 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient, section 31 requires a
84 practitioner to provide that information or facilitate the transfer of the patient to
85 another provider of health care. Section 31 also provides that a pharmacist is not
86 required to fill a prescription for or dispense such a medication. Section 32
87 authorizes the owner or operator of a health care facility to prohibit an employee or
88 independent contractor of the health care facility or any person who provides
89 services on the premises of the health care facility from providing any services
90 relating to prescribing a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient
91 while acting within the scope of his or her employment or contract with the facility
92 or while on the premises of the facility. Section 33 prohibits a health care facility or
93 provider of health care from taking certain actions against an employee or
94 independent contractor who: (1) provides accurate, scientific information
95 concerning end-of-life care to a patient; or (2) facilitates the prescription or self-
96 administration of a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient.
97 Sections 34-37 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a practitioner or
98 pharmacist is authorized to dispense a medication that is designed to end the life of
99 a patient that is a controlled substance or dangerous drug and a patient may self-
100 administer such a medication in accordance with other provisions governing
101 medications designed to end the life of a patient.
102 Section 39 of this bill provides that a proposed protected person shall not be
103 deemed to be in need of a general or special guardian solely because the proposed
104 protected person requested a medication that is designed to end his or her life or
105 revoked such a request.
106 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill prohibit insurers from conditioning life
107 insurance benefits, group life insurance benefits or the payment of claims on
108 whether the insured makes, fails to make or revokes a request for a medication that
109 is designed to end the life of the insured or self-administers such a medication.

110 Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect this prohibition on a
111 policy of group life insurance.
1 WHEREAS, A mentally capable adult patient should have the
2 right to self-determination concerning his or her health care
3 decisions based on his or her values, beliefs or personal preferences;
4 and
5 WHEREAS, It is important that patients have the full range of
6 options for their care, especially at the end of their lives; and
7 WHEREAS, Patients with a terminal illness may undergo
8 unremitting pain, agonizing discomfort and a sudden, continuing
9 and irreversible reduction in their quality of life; and
10 WHEREAS, The availability of medical aid in dying provides an
11 additional palliative care option for persons with a terminal illness
12 who seek to retain their autonomy and some level of control over
13 the progression of their disease or ease unnecessary pain and
14 suffering; and
15 WHEREAS, The integration of medical aid in dying into standard
16 end-of-life care has demonstrably improved such care by
17 contributing to better conversations between providers of health care
18 and patients, earlier and more appropriate enrollment in hospice care
19 and better training concerning palliative care for providers; and
20 WHEREAS, Patient-directed care respects and responds to the
21 decisions, preferences, needs and values of individual patients,
22 ensures that the values of patients direct all clinical decisions
23 concerning their care and ensures that patients are fully informed of
24 and able to access the options for care that they desire; now,
25 therefore,

16 2. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is informed or
17 otherwise discovers that a person has self-administered a
18 medication designed to end his or her life pursuant to sections 5 to

20 (a) May make an appropriate investigation to the extent
21 necessary to determine that the cause of the terminal condition
22 with which the person was diagnosed; and

30 make an investigation with the assistance of the coroner. If the
31 sheriff is not ex officio the coroner, the coroner shall also notify the
32 sheriff, and the district attorney and sheriff shall make
33 the investigation with the assistance of the coroner.
34 [3.] 4. If it is apparent to or can be reasonably inferred by the
35 coroner that a death may have been caused by drug use or

38 occurred following a hospitalization stay of 24 hours or more.
39 [4.] 5. A coroner may issue a subpoena for the production of
40 any document, record or material that is directly related or believed
41 to contain evidence related to an investigation by the coroner.
42 [5.] 6. The holding of a coroner’s inquest is within the sound
43 discretion of the district attorney or district judge of the county. An

5 upon a justice of the peace of the county to preside over it. The
6 justice of the peace shall summon three persons qualified by law to
