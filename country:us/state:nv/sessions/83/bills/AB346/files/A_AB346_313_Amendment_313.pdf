AN ACT relating to health care; revising provisions concerning medical certificates
of death of persons who self-administer a medication that is designed
to end the life of the person; authorizing a physician or advanced
practice registered nurse to prescribe a medication that is designed to
end the life of a patient under certain circumstances; prohibiting
persons other than a patient from administering a medication that is
designed to end the life of the patient; imposing requirements relating
to the medical records of a patient who requests a medication that is
designed to end the life of the patient; providing immunity to certain
providers of health care and health care facilities for certain actions
relating to prescribing or dispensing a medication that is designed to
end the life of a patient; authorizing the owner or operator of a health
care facility to prohibit the provision of certain services relating to a
medication that is designed to end the life of a patient; prohibiting a
person from including certain provisions in a will, contract, agreement
or policy of life insurance; prohibiting certain actions on a policy of
life insurance because the insured requested or revoked a request for a
medication that is designed to end the life of the insured; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient who has been diagnosed with a terminal condition to
2 refuse life-resuscitating or life-sustaining treatment in certain circumstances. (NRS 449A.400-
3 449A.581, 450B.400-450B.590) Sections 5-33 of this bill authorize a patient, under certain
4 circumstances, to self-administer a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient.
5 Section 14 defines “practitioner” to mean a physician, osteopathic physician or advanced

Assembly Amendment No. 313 to Assembly Bill No. 346 Page 4
6 practice registered nurse. Sections 6-13, 15 and 16 define other relevant terms. Section 17
7 authorizes a patient to request that his or her attending practitioner prescribe a medication that
8 is designed to end his or her life if the patient: (1) is at least 18 years of age; (2) has been
9 diagnosed with a terminal condition by at least two practitioners; (3) has made an informed
10 and voluntary decision to end his or her own life; (4) is mentally capable of making such a
11 decision; and (5) is not requesting the medication because of coercion, deception or undue
12 influence. Section 18 prescribes certain requirements concerning the manner in which a
13 patient may request a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient, including that
14 the patient make two verbal requests and one written request for the medication, and that the
15 written request for the medication be signed by a witness. Section 19 prescribes the form for
16 the written request for the medication. Section 20 imposes certain requirements before a
17 practitioner is authorized to prescribe a medication that is designed to end the life of a patient,
18 including that the practitioner: (1) inform the patient of his or her right to revoke a request for
19 the medication at any time; (2) determine and verify that the patient meets the requirements
20 for making such a request; (3) discuss certain relevant factors with the patient, including the
21 diagnosis and prognosis of the patient and alternative options for care; (4) refer the patient to a
22 consulting practitioner who can confirm the diagnosis, prognosis and mental capability of the
23 patient and that the patient has not been coerced or unduly influenced; and (5) instruct the
24 patient against self-administering the medication in public. Section 21 requires a practitioner
25 who determines that a patient who has requested a prescription for a medication that is
26 designed to end his or her life may not be mentally capable to refer the patient to a qualified
27 mental health professional and to receive confirmation about the patient’s mental capability.
28 Section 22: (1) prescribes procedures for the issuance of a prescription for a medication
29 that is designed to end the life of the patient; and (2) provides that only an attending
30 practitioner or a pharmacist may dispense such a medication. Section 22.5 of this bill
31 prescribes the manner in which the attending practitioner may bill the patient or the
32 insurer of the patient for diagnosing the condition of the patient and prescribing the
33 medication. Section 23 prohibits an attending practitioner from prescribing a medication that
34 is designed to end the life of a patient based solely on the age or disability of the patient.
35 Section 24 requires certain providers of health care to include certain information concerning
36 requests and prescriptions for and the dispensing of a medication that is designed to end the
37 life of a patient in the medical record of the patient. If a patient who has requested a
38 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient transfers care to another practitioner or
39 health care facility, sections 24 and 31 require the practitioner or health care facility that
40 previously provided care to the patient to forward the patient’s medical records to the new
41 practitioner or health care facility. Section 27 prescribes certain information that must be
42 reported by an attending practitioner to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
43 Department of Health and Human Services relating to a patient who has been prescribed or
44 self-administered such a medication. Section 28 requires the Division to compile an annual
45 report concerning the implementation of the provisions of this bill authorizing a patient to
46 request a prescription for a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. Sections
47 27, 40 and 43 of this bill provide that such information is otherwise confidential when
48 reported to the Division.
49 Section 25 authorizes a patient, at any time, to revoke a request for a medication that is
50 designed to end his or her life. Sections 26 and 35 of this bill provide that only the patient to
51 whom a medication that is designed to end his or her life is prescribed may administer the
52 medication. Section 26 establishes requirements for the disposal of any unused portion of the
53 medication.
54 Section 33 makes certain persons exempt from professional discipline and immune from
55 civil and criminal penalties and provides that such persons do not violate any applicable
56 standard of care for taking actions authorized by this bill to assist a patient in acquiring a
57 medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. Section 33.3 of this bill requires a
58 person who administers emergency medical services to treat a prescription for a
59 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient as a written do-not-resuscitate
60 order for the purpose of withholding life-sustaining treatment. Section 33.6 of this bill
61 requires a person who administers emergency medical services who responds to a person
62 who has self-administered a medication that is designed to end his or her life to indicate
63 “medical aid in dying” in any report concerning the incident. Section 33.1 of this bill
64 makes a conforming change to include a patient who has self-administered a medication

Assembly Amendment No. 313 to Assembly Bill No. 346 Page 5
65 designed to end his or her life in the definition of “qualified patient” for the purpose of
66 provisions governing the withholding of life-sustaining treatment. Section 29 provides
67 that a death resulting from the self-administration of a medication that is designed to end the
68 life of a patient is not mercy killing, euthanasia, assisted suicide, suicide or homicide when
69 done in accordance with the provisions of this bill, and section 2 of this bill requires a death
70 certificate to list the terminal condition of the patient as the cause of death of the patient.
71 However, section 1.5 of this bill requires a death certificate to include a box that may be
72 marked to indicate that a patient died from the self-administration of a medication that
73 is designed to end the life of a patient, and section 2 requires the death certificate of such
74 a patient to indicate that the patient died in that manner through a mark in that box.
75 Sections 1 and 3 of this bill provide that a coroner, coroner’s deputy or local health officer is
76 not required to certify the cause of such a death. Section 42 of this bill: (1) authorizes a
77 coroner to make an appropriate investigation after discovering that a person has self-
78 administered a medication designed to end the life of the person, to the extent necessary to
79 determine the cause of the terminal condition with which the person was diagnosed; and (2)
80 requires a coroner to cease such an investigation after determining that the terminal condition
81 resulted from a natural cause. Section 41 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise
82 certain internal references.
83 Sections 30 and 38 of this bill prohibit a person from preventing or requiring a person to
84 make or revoke a request for a medication that is designed to end the life of the person as a
85 condition to receiving health care or as a condition in an agreement, contract or will.
86 Section 31 clarifies that a practitioner is not required to prescribe a medication that is
87 designed to end the life of a patient and remains responsible for treating the patient’s pain.
88 However, if a patient who is diagnosed with a terminal condition requests information
89 concerning the prescription and self-administration of a medication that is designed to end the
90 life of the patient, section 31 requires a practitioner to provide that information or facilitate
91 the transfer of the patient to another provider of health care. Section 31 also provides that a
92 pharmacist is not required to fill a prescription for or dispense such a medication. Section 32
93 authorizes the owner or operator of a health care facility to prohibit an employee or
94 independent contractor of the health care facility or any person who provides services on the
95 premises of the health care facility from providing any services relating to prescribing a
96 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient while acting within the scope of his or
97 her employment or contract with the facility or while on the premises of the facility. Section
98 33 prohibits a health care facility or provider of health care from taking certain actions against
99 an employee or independent contractor who: (1) provides accurate, scientific information
100 concerning end-of-life care to a patient; or (2) facilitates the prescription or self-administration
101 of a medication that is designed to end the life of the patient. Sections 34-37 of this bill make
102 conforming changes to clarify that a practitioner or pharmacist is authorized to dispense a
103 medication that is designed to end the life of a patient that is a controlled substance or
104 dangerous drug and a patient may self-administer such a medication in accordance with other
105 provisions governing medications designed to end the life of a patient.
106 Section 39 of this bill provides that a proposed protected person shall not be deemed to
107 be in need of a general or special guardian solely because the proposed protected person
108 requested a medication that is designed to end his or her life or revoked such a request.
109 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill prohibit insurers from conditioning life insurance benefits,
110 group life insurance benefits or the payment of claims on whether the insured makes, fails to
111 make or revokes a request for a medication that is designed to end the life of the insured or
112 self-administers such a medication. Section 46 of this bill makes a conforming change to
113 reflect this prohibition on a policy of group life insurance.
1 WHEREAS, A mentally capable adult patient should have the right to self-
2 determination concerning his or her health care decisions based on his or her
3 values, beliefs or personal preferences; and
4 WHEREAS, It is important that patients have the full range of options for their
5 care, especially at the end of their lives; and

Assembly Amendment No. 313 to Assembly Bill No. 346 Page 6
1 WHEREAS, Patients with a terminal illness may undergo unremitting pain,
2 agonizing discomfort and a sudden, continuing and irreversible reduction in their
3 quality of life; and
4 WHEREAS, The availability of medical aid in dying provides an additional
5 palliative care option for persons with a terminal illness who seek to retain their
6 autonomy and some level of control over the progression of their disease or ease
7 unnecessary pain and suffering; and
8 WHEREAS, The integration of medical aid in dying into standard end-of-life
9 care has demonstrably improved such care by contributing to better conversations
10 between providers of health care and patients, earlier and more appropriate
11 enrollment in hospice care and better training concerning palliative care for
12 providers; and
13 WHEREAS, Patient-directed care respects and responds to the decisions,
14 preferences, needs and values of individual patients, ensures that the values of
15 patients direct all clinical decisions concerning their care and ensures that patients
16 are fully informed of and able to access the options for care that they desire; now,
17 therefore,

14 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
15 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
16 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
17 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
18 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
19 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
20 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
21 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
22 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
23 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
24 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
25 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
26 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
27 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
28 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
29 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
30 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
31 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
32 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
33 record that is not otherwise confidential.
34 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
35 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
36 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
37 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
38 (a) The public record:
39 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
40 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
41 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
42 electronic medium would:
43 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
44 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
45 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
46 otherwise confidential.
47 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
48 custody or control of a public record:
49 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
50 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
51 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.

1 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
2 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
3 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
4 Sec. 41. NRS 259.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 259.010 1. Every county in this State constitutes a coroner’s district, except
6 a county where a coroner is appointed pursuant to the provisions of NRS 244.163.
7 2. The provisions of this chapter, except NRS 259.025, 259.045, 259.047,
8 259.049, subsections [3] 4 and [4] 5 of NRS 259.050, NRS 259.053 and 259.150 to
9 259.180, inclusive, do not apply to any county where a coroner is appointed
10 pursuant to the provisions of NRS 244.163.
11 Sec. 42. NRS 259.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 259.050 1. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is informed that a
13 person has been killed, has committed suicide or has suddenly died under such
14 circumstances as to afford reasonable ground to suspect that the death has been
15 occasioned by unnatural means, the coroner shall make an appropriate
16 investigation.
17 2. When a coroner or the coroner’s deputy is informed or otherwise
18 discovers that a person has self-administered a medication designed to end his or
19 her life pursuant to sections 5 to 33, inclusive, of this act, the coroner:
20 (a) May make an appropriate investigation to the extent necessary to
21 determine that the cause of the terminal condition with which the person was
22 diagnosed; and
23 (b) Must cease investigating the death after determining that the terminal
24 condition with which the person was diagnosed resulted from a natural cause.
25 3. In all cases where it is apparent or can be reasonably inferred that the death
26 may have been caused by a criminal act, the coroner or the coroner’s deputy shall
27 notify the district attorney of the county where the inquiry is made, and the district
28 attorney shall make an investigation with the assistance of the coroner. If the sheriff
29 is not ex officio the coroner, the coroner shall also notify the sheriff, and the district
30 attorney and sheriff shall make the investigation with the assistance of the coroner.
31 [3.] 4. If it is apparent to or can be reasonably inferred by the coroner that a
32 death may have been caused by drug use or poisoning, the coroner shall cause a
33 postmortem examination to be performed on the decedent by a forensic pathologist
34 unless the death occurred following a hospitalization stay of 24 hours or more.
35 [4.] 5. A coroner may issue a subpoena for the production of any document,
36 record or material that is directly related or believed to contain evidence related to
37 an investigation by the coroner.
38 [5.] 6. The holding of a coroner’s inquest is within the sound discretion of the
39 district attorney or district judge of the county. An inquest need not be conducted in
40 any case of death manifestly occasioned by natural cause, suicide, accident, motor
41 vehicle crash or when it is publicly known that the death was caused by a person
42 already in custody, but an inquest must be held unless the district attorney or a
43 district judge certifies that no inquest is required.
44 [6.] 7. If an inquest is to be held, the district attorney shall call upon a justice
45 of the peace of the county to preside over it. The justice of the peace shall summon
46 three persons qualified by law to serve as jurors, to appear before the justice of the
47 peace forthwith at the place where the body is or such other place within the county
48 as may be designated by him or her to inquire into the cause of death.
49 [7.] 8. A single inquest may be held with respect to more than one death,
50 where all the deaths were occasioned by a common cause.
51 Sec. 43. NRS 639.238 is hereby amended to read as follows:
52 639.238 1. Prescriptions filled and on file in a pharmacy are not a public
53 record. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 439.597 and 639.2357, and section

11 (f) An insurance carrier, on receipt of written authorization signed by the
12 patient or his or her legal guardian, authorizing the release of such information;
13 (g) Any person authorized by an order of a district court;
14 (h) Any member, inspector or investigator of a professional licensing board

31 (2) Determining a cause of death; or
32 (3) Performing other duties authorized by law.
33 2. Any copy of a prescription for a controlled substance or a dangerous drug
34 as defined in chapter 454 of NRS that is issued to a county coroner, medical

44 its face “Copy, Not Refillable—For Reference Purposes Only.” The copy must bear
45 the name or initials of the registered pharmacist who prepared the copy.

9 requested a medication designed to end the life of the insured, revoked such a
10 request or self-administered such a medication.
11 2. Any provision of a policy of life insurance or annuity contract that, in
12 conflict with the provisions of this section, allows the denial of a claim or
13 cancellation of the policy or contract and which is included in a policy or
14 contract that has been or is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed before, on or
15 after the effective date of this act is void and unenforceable.
