AN ACT relating to district courts; prescribing the method for
increasing the number of district judges in certain judicial
districts based upon certain increases in population;
increasing the number of district judges in certain judicial
districts; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) divides the State into 11 judicial districts; and (2) sets forth
2 the number of district judges in each judicial district. (NRS 3.010, 3.011-3.0197)
3 The Nevada Constitution authorizes the Legislature to increase or decrease the
4 number of district judges. (Nev. Const. Art. 6, § 5) Section 1 of this bill revises
5 requirements governing the number of district judges in each judicial district whose
6 population is 350,000 or more by setting forth a schedule for increasing the number
7 of district judges in any such judicial district based upon certain increases in the
8 population of the judicial district. If the schedule requires an increase in the number
9 of district judges due to an increased population of a judicial district, section 1
10 provides that if the Chief Judge of the judicial district submits to the Legislature
11 and the board of county commissioners of each county located within the judicial
12 district an opinion stating that the caseload of the judicial district does not warrant
13 the increase in the number of district judges set forth in the schedule, the number of
14 district judges must not be increased unless the Legislature, by resolution, expressly
15 approves of the increase.
16 Section 2 of this bill increases the number of district judges in the First Judicial
17 District, which includes Carson City and Storey County, from two district judges to

22 judges in the Sixth Judicial District, which includes Humboldt County, from one
23 district judge to two district judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.016) Sections 6 and 7 of this
24 bill increase the number of district judges in the Eighth Judicial District, which
25 includes Clark County, by eighteen district judges, eight of whom must be judges
26 of the family court. (NRS 3.010, 3.018, 3.0185) Section 8 of this bill increases the
27 number of district judges in the Tenth Judicial District, which includes Churchill
28 County, from one district judge to two district judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.0195) Section
29 9 of this bill increases the number of district judges in the Eleventh Judicial
30 District, which includes Lander County, Mineral County and Pershing County,
31 from one district judge to two district judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.0197) Section 10 of
