AN ACT relating to district courts; [prescribing the method for increasing the
number of district judges in certain judicial districts based upon certain
increases in population;] increasing the number of district judges in
certain judicial districts; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) divides the State into 11 judicial districts; and (2) sets forth the number
2 of district judges in each judicial district. (NRS 3.010, 3.011-3.0197) The Nevada Constitution
3 authorizes the Legislature to increase or decrease the number of district judges. (Nev. Const.
4 Art. 6, § 5) [Section 1 of this bill revises requirements governing the number of district judges
5 in each judicial district whose population is 350,000 or more by setting forth a schedule for
6 increasing the number of district judges in any such judicial district based upon certain
7 increases in the population of the judicial district. If the schedule requires an increase in the
8 number of district judges due to an increased population of a judicial district, section 1
9 provides that if the Chief Judge of the judicial district submits to the Legislature and the board
10 of county commissioners of each county located within the judicial district an opinion stating
11 that the caseload of the judicial district does not warrant the increase in the number of district
12 judges set forth in the schedule, the number of district judges must not be increased unless the
13 Legislature, by resolution, expressly approves of the increase.]
14 Section 2 of this bill increases the number of district judges in the First Judicial District,
15 which includes Carson City and Storey County, from two district judges to three district
16 judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.011) [Sections 3 and 4 of this bill increase the number of district judges
17 in the Second Judicial District, which includes Washoe County, by three district judges, one
18 of whom must be a judge of the family court. (NRS 3.010, 3.012, 3.0125) Section 5 of this bill
19 increases the number of district judges in the Sixth Judicial District, which includes Humboldt
20 County, from one district judge to two district judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.016) Sections 6 and 7 of
21 this bill increase the number of district judges in the Eighth Judicial District, which includes
22 Clark County, by eighteen district judges, eight of whom must be judges of the family court.
23 (NRS 3.010, 3.018, 3.0185)] Section 8 of this bill increases the number of district judges in
24 the Tenth Judicial District, which includes Churchill County, from one district judge to two

Assembly Amendment No. 286 to Assembly Bill No. 66 Page 4
25 district judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.0195) [Section 9 of this bill increases the number of district
26 judges in the Eleventh Judicial District, which includes Lander County, Mineral County and
27 Pershing County, from one district judge to two district judges. (NRS 3.010, 3.0197)] Section
28 10 of this bill sets out the timeframe for the election of the additional judges who will take
29 office on January 4, 2027.

2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, in addition to the district
4 judges established pursuant to NRS 3.011 to 3.0197, inclusive, the number of
5 district judges of each judicial district whose population is 350,000 or more must
6 be increased according to the population of the county or counties constituting
7 the judicial district, as certified by the Governor in even-numbered years
8 pursuant to NRS 360.285, in accordance with the following schedule:
9 (a) In each judicial district in which a family court has been established
10 pursuant to NRS 3.0105, the number of district judges must be increased by one
11 district judge who is not a judge of the family court and one district judge who is
12 a judge of the family court for each 40,000 population increase of the judicial
13 district that occurs on or after January 1, 2026.
14 (b) In each judicial district in which a family court has not been established,
15 the number of district judges must be increased by one district judge for each

23 3. If the schedule set forth in subsection 1 provides for an increase in the
24 number of district judges in a judicial district, and a majority of the district

27 the caseload does not warrant the increase provided for in subsection 1, the Chief
28 Judge shall notify the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the board
29 of county commissioners of each county located within the judicial district of his
30 or her opinion on or before March 15 of the even-numbered year in which the
31 population of the judicial district provides for such an increase. The Director of
32 the Legislative Counsel Bureau shall submit the opinion to the next regular
33 session of the Legislature for its consideration. If the Chief Judge transmits such
34 a notice to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and any board of
35 county commissioners, the number of district judges must not be increased
36 during that period unless the Legislature, by resolution, expressly approves the
37 increase.] (Deleted by amendment.)
