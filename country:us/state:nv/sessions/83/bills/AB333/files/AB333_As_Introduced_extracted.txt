Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law directed the State Board of Agriculture to lease certain real

3 (Chapter 251, Statutes of Nevada 1951, at pages 366-67) A portion of that real
-
*AB333*
– 2 –
4 property was later exempted from the trust to enable Washoe County to construct a
5 county public building complex on the real property. (Chapter 52, Statutes of
6 Nevada 1977, at pages 123-26; chapter 561, Statutes of Nevada 1997, at pages
7 2726-28) Section 10 of this bill terminates the lease for that real property which is
8 owned by the State of Nevada and leased to Washoe County. Section 14 of this bill
9 repeals the chapters of Statutes of Nevada that are related to the lease of this real
10 property to Washoe County. Section 9 of this bill sets forth a legislative declaration
11 relating to the legislative history of the lease of that real property and the reasons
12 for terminating the lease.
13 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of State Lands
14 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State
15 Land Registrar, to enter into an agreement to lease to Washoe County the real
16 property in use as a county public building complex. Section 11 requires that, as
17 part of the agreement, Washoe County must survey and generate a legal description
18 for the portion of the real property in use by Washoe County.
19 Section 12 of this bill provides that, following the termination of the lease, the
20 State Department of Agriculture is responsible for the operation and maintenance of
21 the portion of the real property that is not transferred to Washoe County, which
22 shall be referred to as the Nevada State Fairgrounds.
23 Sections 5 and 12 of this bill require the Director of the State Department of
24 Agriculture to establish a state fairground, to be known as the Nevada State
25 Fairgrounds, on the portion of the real property not leased to Washoe County.
26 Section 5 requires the Department to develop, maintain, operate and promote the
27 use of the Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon. Section 12
28 further provides that the Nevada State Fairgrounds are subject to the trust imposed
29 on that real property.
30 Section 6 of this bill creates the Account for the Maintenance and Operation of
31 the Nevada State Fairgrounds in the State General Fund with the money in the
32 Account to be used to develop, maintain, operate and promote the use of the
33 Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon.
34 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define “Department” and “Director”, respectively.
35 Section 2 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of sections 5 and 6
36 and certain provisions of existing law relating to fairs and exhibits. (Chapter 551 of
37 NRS) Section 7 of this bill revises certain references to the Department and
38 Director consistent with the definitions.
39 Existing law requires the Nevada Junior Livestock Show Board to review the
40 uses of the real property leased to Washoe County for use as a fairground and any
41 physical improvements or changes to the facilities at the fairground. (NRS 563.080)
42 Section 8 of this bill instead requires the Board to review any physical
43 improvements or changes to the Nevada State Fairgrounds.

building space within the next 15 years, and long-term growth
envisaged can only be accommodated through the
construction of additional facilities in a location that allows
sufficient area for planned expansion.

Section 17:
6. A portion of the premises leased by the State of
Nevada to Washoe County on May 1, 1951, provides an
excellent site for the construction of a county building
complex, having accessibility to the developing highway
transportation system, proximity to the citizens of the cities of
Reno and Sparks and the availability of free public parking.

Section 18:
7. On September 2, 1972, Washoe County executed a
lease with the Nevada State Fair, Inc., a nonprofit
corporation, by the terms of which the Washoe County
fairgrounds were leased to the Nevada State Fair, Inc., for 25
years for a nominal rent for the purpose of conducting the
annual Nevada State Fair; that such lease was amended on
September 5, 1975, specifically exempting 13.503 acres from
the original lease and reserving such parcel for the exclusive
use of Washoe County, subject to compatible use by the
Nevada State Fair, Inc., on official fair days.

Section 19:
8. In addition to its public building requirements,
Washoe County needs a senior citizens service center or a
community focal point on aging where older persons as
-
*AB333*
– 12 –
individuals or in groups can come together for services and
activities which enhance their dignity, support their
independence and encourage their involvement in and with
the community; that the registered voters of Washoe County,
Nevada, at a special election held September 14, 1976,
recognized the need for constructing and maintaining a senior
citizens service center by approving the issuance and sale of
Washoe County’s general obligation bonds in an amount not
to exceed $1,500,000 for the construction and equipping of
such a center by a vote of 18,385 to 6,212; that for the
reasons stated in subsection 6 construction and operation of
the senior citizens service center on a portion of the Washoe
County fairgrounds is desirable.
SEC. 2. 1. Upon the effective date of this act the
administrator of the division of state lands of the state
department of conservation and natural resources, as ex
officio state land registrar, is directed forthwith to execute an
amended lease with Washoe County, Nevada, without
consideration other than the fencing and beautification herein
required, whereby the real property described in section 3 of
this act shall be exempt from any trust imposed by the
statutes enumerated in section 1 of this act and shall be made
immediately available for use by Washoe County during the
term of the existing lease expiring March 21, 2050, for the
purposes of constructing and maintaining thereon a county
public building complex, including but not limited to public
buildings related to health, welfare, finance, administration
and aging functions. Washoe County shall agree in such
amended lease to erect during fiscal year 1977-1978 a good
and substantial fence and other beautification on the west side
of Sutro Street in Reno, Nevada, from Oddie Boulevard south
to the north boundary line of the parcel proposed to be
utilized as a site for the senior citizens service center.

Section 20:
2. The amended lease directed to be executed by
subsection 1 shall not affect the term of the lease from the
State of Nevada to Washoe County, which term expires,
unless otherwise directed by the legislature, on March 21,
2050; and as provided in subsection 2 of chapter 295, Statutes
of Nevada 1951, upon the expiration of the term of the lease
on March 21, 2050, the property and all improvements
thereon shall revert to the State of Nevada.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring the
Director of the State Department of Agriculture to
establish the Nevada State Fairgrounds; creating the
Account for the Maintenance and Operation of the
Nevada State Fairgrounds; revising certain duties of
the Nevada Junior Livestock Show Board relating to the
real property leased to Washoe County for use as a
fairground; terminating a lease for certain real property
leased to Washoe County; requiring the State Land

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law directed the State Board of Agriculture to lease certain real
2 property to Washoe County subject to a trust imposed on that real property.
3 (Chapter 251, Statutes of Nevada 1951, at pages 366-67) A portion of that real
-
*AB333*

– 2 –
4 property was later exempted from the trust to enable Washoe County to construct a
5 county public building complex on the real property. (Chapter 52, Statutes of
6 Nevada 1977, at pages 123-26; chapter 561, Statutes of Nevada 1997, at pages
7 2726-28) Section 10 of this bill terminates the lease for that real property which is
8 owned by the State of Nevada and leased to Washoe County. Section 14 of this bill
9 repeals the chapters of Statutes of Nevada that are related to the lease of this real
10 property to Washoe County. Section 9 of this bill sets forth a legislative declaration
11 relating to the legislative history of the lease of that real property and the reasons
12 for terminating the lease.
13 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of State Lands
14 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State
15 Land Registrar, to enter into an agreement to lease to Washoe County the real
16 property in use as a county public building complex. Section 11 requires that, as
17 part of the agreement, Washoe County must survey and generate a legal description
18 for the portion of the real property in use by Washoe County.
19 Section 12 of this bill provides that, following the termination of the lease, the
20 State Department of Agriculture is responsible for the operation and maintenance of
21 the portion of the real property that is not transferred to Washoe County, which
22 shall be referred to as the Nevada State Fairgrounds.
23 Sections 5 and 12 of this bill require the Director of the State Department of
24 Agriculture to establish a state fairground, to be known as the Nevada State
25 Fairgrounds, on the portion of the real property not leased to Washoe County.
26 Section 5 requires the Department to develop, maintain, operate and promote the
27 use of the Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon. Section 12
28 further provides that the Nevada State Fairgrounds are subject to the trust imposed
29 on that real property.
30 Section 6 of this bill creates the Account for the Maintenance and Operation of
31 the Nevada State Fairgrounds in the State General Fund with the money in the
32 Account to be used to develop, maintain, operate and promote the use of the
33 Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon.
34 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define “Department” and “Director”, respectively.
35 Section 2 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of sections 5 and 6
36 and certain provisions of existing law relating to fairs and exhibits. (Chapter 551 of
37 NRS) Section 7 of this bill revises certain references to the Department and
38 Director consistent with the definitions.
39 Existing law requires the Nevada Junior Livestock Show Board to review the
40 uses of the real property leased to Washoe County for use as a fairground and any
41 physical improvements or changes to the facilities at the fairground. (NRS 563.080)
42 Section 8 of this bill instead requires the Board to review any physical
43 improvements or changes to the Nevada State Fairgrounds.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

title of such acquired property to be vested in the State of
Nevada for the sole use and benefit of the State of Nevada.

envisaged can only be accommodated through the
construction of additional facilities in a location that allows
sufficient area for planned expansion.

the original lease and reserving such parcel for the exclusive

community focal point on aging where older persons as
-
*AB333*

– 12 –
individuals or in groups can come together for services and
activities which enhance their dignity, support their
independence and encourage their involvement in and with
the community; that the registered voters of Washoe County,
Nevada, at a special election held September 14, 1976,
recognized the need for constructing and maintaining a senior
citizens service center by approving the issuance and sale of
Washoe County’s general obligation bonds in an amount not
to exceed $1,500,000 for the construction and equipping of
such a center by a vote of 18,385 to 6,212; that for the

unless otherwise directed by the legislature, on March 21,
2050; and as provided in subsection 2 of chapter 295, Statutes
of Nevada 1951, upon the expiration of the term of the lease
on March 21, 2050, the property and all improvements
thereon shall revert to the State of Nevada.

the May 1, 1951, lease to March 21, 2050, upon the same
terms.
5. The limited building expansion capacity of Washoe
County coupled with the growth of the county dictate the
necessity for providing additional county’s building space
within the next 15 years, and the long-term growth envisaged
can only be accommodated through the construction of
additional facilities in a location that is contiguous to existing
facilities and allows sufficient area for planned expansion.
6. A portion of the premises leased by the State of
Nevada to Washoe County on May 1, 1951, provides an
excellent site for the construction of a county building
complex, having accessibility to the developing highway
transportation system, proximity to the residents of the cities
of Reno and Sparks and the availability of free public
parking.
7. On September 2, 1972, Washoe County executed a
lease with the Nevada State Fair, Inc., a nonprofit
corporation, by the terms of which the Washoe County
fairgrounds were leased to the Nevada State Fair, Inc., for 25
years for a nominal rent for the purpose of conducting the
annual Nevada State Fair; that such lease was amended on
September 5, 1975, specifically exempting 13.503 acres from
the original lease and reserving such parcel for the exclusive
use of Washoe County, subject to compatible use by the
Nevada State Fair, Inc., on official fair days.

8. In addition to its administrative building and senior
citizen center constructed on the 13.503 acres subject to the
lease executed on September 2, 1972, described above,
Washoe County needs a regional emergency operations
center, regional dispatch center and additional parking for
these and the other facilities at this location and for the
reasons stated in subsection 6, construction and operation of a
regional emergency operation facility, regional dispatch
center and additional parking on a portion of the Washoe
County fairgrounds is desirable.
Sec. 2. 1. Upon the effective date of this act, the
Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the State
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex
officio State Land Registrar, is directed forthwith to execute
an amended lease with Washoe County, Nevada, whereby the

from any trust imposed by the statutes enumerated in section
1 of this act and shall be made immediately available for use
by Washoe County during the term of the existing lease
expiring on March 21, 2050, for the purposes of constructing
and maintaining thereon a county public building complex.
2. The amended lease directed to be executed by
subsection 1 shall not affect the term of the lease from the
State of Nevada to Washoe County, which term expires,
unless otherwise directed by the Legislature, on March 21,
2050; and as provided in subsection 2 of chapter 295, Statutes
of Nevada 1951, upon the expiration of the term of the lease
on March 21, 2050, the property and all improvements
thereon shall revert to the State of Nevada.
