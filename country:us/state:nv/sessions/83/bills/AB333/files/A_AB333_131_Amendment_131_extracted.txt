Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law directed the State Board of Agriculture to lease certain real property to
2 Washoe County subject to a trust imposed on that real property. (Chapter 251, Statutes of
3 Nevada 1951, at pages 366-67) A portion of that real property was later exempted from the
4 trust to enable Washoe County to construct a county public building complex on the real
5 property. (Chapter 52, Statutes of Nevada 1977, at pages 123-26; chapter 561, Statutes of
6 Nevada 1997, at pages 2726-28) Section 10 of this bill terminates the lease for that real
7 property which is owned by the State of Nevada and leased to Washoe County. Section 14 of
8 this bill repeals the chapters of Statutes of Nevada that are related to the lease of this real
9 property to Washoe County. Section 9 of this bill sets forth a legislative declaration relating to
Assembly Amendment No. 131 to Assembly Bill No. 333 Page 4
10 the legislative history of the lease of that real property and the reasons for terminating the
11 lease.
12 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the
13 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State Land Registrar,
14 to enter into an agreement to lease to Washoe County the real property in use as a county
15 public building complex. Section 11 requires that, as part of the agreement, Washoe County
16 must survey and generate a legal description for the portion of the real property in use by
17 Washoe County.
18 Section 12 of this bill provides that, following the termination of the lease, the State
19 Department of Agriculture is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the portion of
20 the real property that is not [transferred] leased to Washoe County, which shall be referred to
21 as the Nevada State Fairgrounds.
22 Sections 5 and 12 of this bill require the Director of the State Department of Agriculture
23 to establish a state fairground, to be known as the Nevada State Fairgrounds, on the portion of
24 the real property not leased to Washoe County. Section 5 requires the Department to develop,
25 maintain, operate and promote the use of the Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities
26 located thereon. Section 12 further provides that the Nevada State Fairgrounds are subject to
27 the trust imposed on that real property.
28 Section 6 of this bill creates the Account for the Maintenance and Operation of the
29 Nevada State Fairgrounds in the State General Fund [with] and requires that the money in
30 the Account [to] be used to develop, maintain, operate and promote the use of the Nevada
31 State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon.
32 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define “Department” and [“Director”,] “Director,”
33 respectively. Section 2 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of sections 5 and
34 6 and certain provisions of existing law relating to fairs and exhibits. (Chapter 551 of NRS)
35 Section 7 of this bill revises certain references to the Department and Director consistent with
36 the definitions.
37 Existing law requires the Nevada Junior Livestock Show Board to review the uses of the
38 real property leased to Washoe County for use as a fairground and any physical improvements
39 or changes to the facilities at the fairground. (NRS 563.080) Section 8 of this bill instead
40 requires the Board to review any physical improvements or changes to the Nevada State
41 Fairgrounds.

AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring the Director of the
State Department of Agriculture to establish the Nevada State
Fairgrounds; creating the Account for the Maintenance and Operation
of the Nevada State Fairgrounds; revising certain duties of the Nevada
Junior Livestock Show Board relating to the real property leased to
Washoe County for use as a fairground; terminating a lease for certain
real property leased to Washoe County; requiring the State Land
Registrar to enter into an agreement to lease certain real property to
Washoe County; requiring the State Department of Agriculture to
assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of certain real

lease of certain real property to Washoe County; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law directed the State Board of Agriculture to lease certain real property to
2 Washoe County subject to a trust imposed on that real property. (Chapter 251, Statutes of
3 Nevada 1951, at pages 366-67) A portion of that real property was later exempted from the
4 trust to enable Washoe County to construct a county public building complex on the real
5 property. (Chapter 52, Statutes of Nevada 1977, at pages 123-26; chapter 561, Statutes of
6 Nevada 1997, at pages 2726-28) Section 10 of this bill terminates the lease for that real
7 property which is owned by the State of Nevada and leased to Washoe County. Section 14 of
8 this bill repeals the chapters of Statutes of Nevada that are related to the lease of this real
9 property to Washoe County. Section 9 of this bill sets forth a legislative declaration relating to

Assembly Amendment No. 131 to Assembly Bill No. 333 Page 4
10 the legislative history of the lease of that real property and the reasons for terminating the
11 lease.
12 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the
13 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State Land Registrar,
14 to enter into an agreement to lease to Washoe County the real property in use as a county
15 public building complex. Section 11 requires that, as part of the agreement, Washoe County
16 must survey and generate a legal description for the portion of the real property in use by
17 Washoe County.
18 Section 12 of this bill provides that, following the termination of the lease, the State
19 Department of Agriculture is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the portion of
20 the real property that is not [transferred] leased to Washoe County, which shall be referred to
21 as the Nevada State Fairgrounds.
22 Sections 5 and 12 of this bill require the Director of the State Department of Agriculture
23 to establish a state fairground, to be known as the Nevada State Fairgrounds, on the portion of
24 the real property not leased to Washoe County. Section 5 requires the Department to develop,
25 maintain, operate and promote the use of the Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities
26 located thereon. Section 12 further provides that the Nevada State Fairgrounds are subject to
27 the trust imposed on that real property.
28 Section 6 of this bill creates the Account for the Maintenance and Operation of the
29 Nevada State Fairgrounds in the State General Fund [with] and requires that the money in
30 the Account [to] be used to develop, maintain, operate and promote the use of the Nevada
31 State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon.
32 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define “Department” and [“Director”,] “Director,”
33 respectively. Section 2 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of sections 5 and
34 6 and certain provisions of existing law relating to fairs and exhibits. (Chapter 551 of NRS)
35 Section 7 of this bill revises certain references to the Department and Director consistent with
36 the definitions.
37 Existing law requires the Nevada Junior Livestock Show Board to review the uses of the
38 real property leased to Washoe County for use as a fairground and any physical improvements
39 or changes to the facilities at the fairground. (NRS 563.080) Section 8 of this bill instead
40 requires the Board to review any physical improvements or changes to the Nevada State
41 Fairgrounds.
