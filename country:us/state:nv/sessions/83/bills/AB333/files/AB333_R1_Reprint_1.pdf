Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law directed the State Board of Agriculture to lease certain real
2 property to Washoe County subject to a trust imposed on that real property.
3 (Chapter 251, Statutes of Nevada 1951, at pages 366-67) A portion of that real
4 property was later exempted from the trust to enable Washoe County to construct a
5 county public building complex on the real property. (Chapter 52, Statutes of
6 Nevada 1977, at pages 123-26; chapter 561, Statutes of Nevada 1997, at pages
7 2726-28) Section 10 of this bill terminates the lease for that real property which is
8 owned by the State of Nevada and leased to Washoe County. Section 14 of this bill
9 repeals the chapters of Statutes of Nevada that are related to the lease of this real
10 property to Washoe County. Section 9 of this bill sets forth a legislative declaration
11 relating to the legislative history of the lease of that real property and the reasons
12 for terminating the lease.
13 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of State Lands
14 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State
15 Land Registrar, to enter into an agreement to lease to Washoe County the real
16 property in use as a county public building complex. Section 11 requires that, as
17 part of the agreement, Washoe County must survey and generate a legal description
18 for the portion of the real property in use by Washoe County.
19 Section 12 of this bill provides that, following the termination of the lease, the
20 State Department of Agriculture is responsible for the operation and maintenance of
21 the portion of the real property that is not leased to Washoe County, which shall be
22 referred to as the Nevada State Fairgrounds.
23 Sections 5 and 12 of this bill require the Director of the State Department of
24 Agriculture to establish a state fairground, to be known as the Nevada State
25 Fairgrounds, on the portion of the real property not leased to Washoe County.
26 Section 5 requires the Department to develop, maintain, operate and promote the
27 use of the Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon. Section 12
28 further provides that the Nevada State Fairgrounds are subject to the trust imposed
29 on that real property.
30 Section 6 of this bill creates the Account for the Maintenance and Operation of
31 the Nevada State Fairgrounds in the State General Fund and requires that the
32 money in the Account be used to develop, maintain, operate and promote the use of
33 the Nevada State Fairgrounds and any facilities located thereon.
34 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define “Department” and “Director,” respectively.
35 Section 2 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of sections 5 and 6
36 and certain provisions of existing law relating to fairs and exhibits. (Chapter 551 of
37 NRS) Section 7 of this bill revises certain references to the Department and
38 Director consistent with the definitions.
39 Existing law requires the Nevada Junior Livestock Show Board to review the
40 uses of the real property leased to Washoe County for use as a fairground and any
41 physical improvements or changes to the facilities at the fairground. (NRS 563.080)
42 Section 8 of this bill instead requires the Board to review any physical
43 improvements or changes to the Nevada State Fairgrounds.

Reno and Sparks and the availability of free public parking.
7. On September 2, 1972, Washoe County executed a
lease with the Nevada State Fair, Inc., a nonprofit
corporation, by the terms of which the Washoe County
fairgrounds were leased to the Nevada State Fair, Inc., for 25
years for a nominal rent for the purpose of conducting the
annual Nevada State Fair; that such lease was amended on
September 5, 1975, specifically exempting 13.503 acres from
the original lease and reserving such parcel for the exclusive
use of Washoe County, subject to compatible use by the
Nevada State Fair, Inc., on official fair days.
8. In addition to its public building requirements,
Washoe County needs a senior citizens service center or a
community focal point on aging where older persons as
individuals or in groups can come together for services and
activities which enhance their dignity, support their
independence and encourage their involvement in and with
the community; that the registered voters of Washoe County,
Nevada, at a special election held September 14, 1976,
recognized the need for constructing and maintaining a senior
citizens service center by approving the issuance and sale of
Washoe County’s general obligation bonds in an amount not
to exceed $1,500,000 for the construction and equipping of
such a center by a vote of 18,385 to 6,212; that for the
reasons stated in subsection 6 construction and operation of
the senior citizens service center on a portion of the Washoe
County fairgrounds is desirable.
SEC. 2. 1. Upon the effective date of this act the
administrator of the division of state lands of the state
department of conservation and natural resources, as ex
officio state land registrar, is directed forthwith to execute an
amended lease with Washoe County, Nevada, without
consideration other than the fencing and beautification herein
required, whereby the real property described in section 3 of
this act shall be exempt from any trust imposed by the
statutes enumerated in section 1 of this act and shall be made
immediately available for use by Washoe County during the
term of the existing lease expiring March 21, 2050, for the
purposes of constructing and maintaining thereon a county
public building complex, including but not limited to public
buildings related to health, welfare, finance, administration
and aging functions. Washoe County shall agree in such
amended lease to erect during fiscal year 1977-1978 a good
and substantial fence and other beautification on the west side

to the north boundary line of the parcel proposed to be

2050; and as provided in subsection 2 of chapter 295, Statutes
of Nevada 1951, upon the expiration of the term of the lease

thereon shall revert to the State of Nevada.

Chapter 561, Statutes of Nevada 1997:
Section 1. The Legislature finds that:
1. By the provisions of chapter XXVII, Statutes of
Nevada 1887, the Nevada state agricultural society, a state
institution, was empowered to expend appropriated money to
purchase and improve fairgrounds, the title of such acquired
property to be vested in the State of Nevada for the sole use
and benefit of the State of Nevada.
2. On March 9, 1889, the Nevada state agricultural
society caused the NE 1/4 SW 1/4 and SE 1/4 NW 1/4 of
Section 1, T. 19 N., R. 19 E., M.D.B. & M., in Washoe
County, Nevada, to be conveyed to the State of Nevada in

3. On May 1, 1951, the state board of agriculture,
pursuant to chapter 251, Statutes of Nevada 1951, leased the
property described in subsection 2 (approximately 80 acres

Nevada, for 50 years with the express provision that the
lessee “recognized the trust imposed by Chapter XXVII,
Statutes of Nevada 1887, * * * and agrees to manage, control
and properly maintain the said property subject to said trust.”
4. On August 3, 1971, an amendment made pursuant to
chapter 295, Statutes of Nevada 1971, extended the term of
the May 1, 1951, lease to March 21, 2050, upon the same
terms.
5. The limited building expansion capacity of Washoe
County coupled with the growth of the county dictate the
necessity for providing additional county’s building space
within the next 15 years, and the long-term growth envisaged
can only be accommodated through the construction of
additional facilities in a location that is contiguous to existing
facilities and allows sufficient area for planned expansion.
6. A portion of the premises leased by the State of
Nevada to Washoe County on May 1, 1951, provides an
excellent site for the construction of a county building

fairgrounds were leased to the Nevada State Fair, Inc., for 25
years for a nominal rent for the purpose of conducting the
annual Nevada State Fair; that such lease was amended on
September 5, 1975, specifically exempting 13.503 acres from
the original lease and reserving such parcel for the exclusive

8. In addition to its administrative building and senior
citizen center constructed on the 13.503 acres subject to the
lease executed on September 2, 1972, described above,
Washoe County needs a regional emergency operations
center, regional dispatch center and additional parking for
these and the other facilities at this location and for the
reasons stated in subsection 6, construction and operation of a
regional emergency operation facility, regional dispatch
center and additional parking on a portion of the Washoe
