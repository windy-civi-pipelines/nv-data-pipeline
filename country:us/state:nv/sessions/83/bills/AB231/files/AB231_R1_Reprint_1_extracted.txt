AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain service contracts to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of providers of service contracts by the
2 Commissioner of Insurance. (Chapter 690C of NRS) Existing law requires that a
3 service contract specify the duties of the provider and any limitations, exceptions or
4 exclusions. (NRS 690C.260) This bill sets forth certain duties of a provider of a
5 home warranty service contract, which this bill defines to mean a service contract
6 that covers only the structural components, appliances or home systems of a
7 residence. This bill requires the duties of a provider of a home warranty service
8 contract set forth in the contract to include, without limitation, the duty to ensure
9 that: (1) any goods, other than an air conditioner, furnace or heater in a home or
10 dwelling, covered under the service contract are restored to sound working
11 condition within 14 business days after receiving notice that the goods are
12 defective; and (2) any goods which are restored and become defective within 14
13 business days after the date on which the goods were restored are restored within 2
14 business days after receiving notice that the goods are defective. With respect to an
15 air conditioner, furnace or heater in a home or dwelling that is covered under a
16 service contract, this bill requires a service contract to provide that the provider has
17 the duty to: (1) ensure that the air conditioner, furnace or heater is restored to sound
18 working condition within 5 business days after receiving notice that the air
19 conditioner, furnace or heater is defective; and (2) if the provider fails to do so,
