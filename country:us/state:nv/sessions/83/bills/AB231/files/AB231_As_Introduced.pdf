EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring a service contract to
impose certain duties upon the provider of the service
contract; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of providers of service contracts by the
2 Commissioner of Insurance. (Chapter 690C of NRS) Existing law requires that a
3 service contract specify the duties of the provider and any limitations, exceptions or
4 exclusions. (NRS 690C.260) This bill requires those duties to include, without
5 limitation, the duty to ensure that: (1) any goods, other than an air conditioner in a
6 home or dwelling, covered under the service contract are restored to sound working
7 condition within 14 business days after receiving notice that the goods are
8 defective; and (2) any goods which are restored and become defective within 14
9 business days after the date on which the goods were restored are restored within 2
10 business days after receiving notice that the goods are defective. With respect to an
11 air conditioner in a home or dwelling that is covered under a service contract, this
12 bill requires a service contract to provide that the provider has the duty to: (1)
13 ensure that the air conditioner is restored to sound working condition within 5
14 business days after receiving notice that the air conditioner is defective; and (2) if
15 the provider fails to do so, provide the holder with sleeping accommodations in a
16 hotel until the air conditioner is restored.

33 determines is false or misleading.
34 3. As used in this section, “restored” means restoration to a
