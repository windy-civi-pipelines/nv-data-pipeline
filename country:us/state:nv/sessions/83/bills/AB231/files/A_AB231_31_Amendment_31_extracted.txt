2 Commissioner of Insurance. (Chapter 690C of NRS) Existing law requires that a service
3 contract specify the duties of the provider and any limitations, exceptions or exclusions. (NRS
4 690C.260) This bill sets forth certain duties of a provider of a home warranty service
5 contract, which this bill defines to mean a service contract that covers only the structural
6 components, appliances or home systems of a residence. This bill requires [those] the
7 duties of a provider of a home warranty service contract set forth in the contract to
8 include, without limitation, the duty to ensure that: (1) any goods, other than an air conditioner
9 , furnace or heater in a home or dwelling, covered under the service contract are restored to
10 sound working condition within 14 business days after receiving notice that the goods are
11 defective; and (2) any goods which are restored and become defective within 14 business days
12 after the date on which the goods were restored are restored within 2 business days after
13 receiving notice that the goods are defective. With respect to an air conditioner , furnace or
14 heater in a home or dwelling that is covered under a service contract, this bill requires a
15 service contract to provide that the provider has the duty to: (1) ensure that the air conditioner
16 , furnace or heater is restored to sound working condition within 5 business days after
17 receiving notice that the air conditioner , furnace or heater is defective; and (2) if the
18 provider fails to do so, provide the holder with [sleeping accommodations in a hotel] a per
19 diem allowance for lodging until the air conditioner , furnace or heater is restored.
