Assembly Bill No. 296–Assemblymember Watts
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the initial
or renewal registration of a vehicle; prescribing certain
requirements for such installment loans; authorizing the
Director of the Department to authorize the use of digital
license plates; providing requirements governing the use of
digital license plates; revising the applicability of certain
provisions governing installment lenders to a lender who
contracts with the Department; extending the prospective
expiration of the pilot program to gather data about annual
vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this
State; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1)
requires the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and
taxes owed by vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2)
prohibits such a person from charging interest on an installment loan or charging a
fee or combination of fees for the installment loan in excess of 15 percent of the
total amount financed; (3) prohibits the making of loans less than $250; and (4)
prohibits the person from rolling over or refinancing any installment loan made
pursuant to section 1 into any other loan to the vehicle owner.
Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
(4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds
the fee charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill
provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person
who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to require
the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the
business of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS)
Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to
make loans to apply for a license for a place of business located outside this State.
Section 5.7 of this bill additionally authorizes such a person to conduct the business
of making loans within any office, suite, room or place of business in which any
other business is solicited or engaged in.
Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
(NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
(NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill extends the prospective
expiration of the pilot program until December 31, 2030.

– 4 –
the applicable fees and taxes due for the initial or renewal

Sec. 2. Chapter 482 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
thereto a new section to read as follows:
1. The Director may authorize the use of digital license plates
in accordance with this section upon application by a person who
otherwise complies with the requirements for registration and

2. The use of a digital license plate must be voluntary and the

(c) By regulation, restrict the types or classes of vehicles for

5. The Department may authorize digital license plates to
replicate the appearance of a license plate type other than a
standard license plate. If the Department authorizes a digital
license plate to replicate the appearance of a special license plate,
the Department shall charge for the use or renewal of a digital
license plate which replicates the appearance of a special license
plate the same fees which are charged for the conventional version
of the special license plate. Any such fee which is imposed to
generate financial support for a particular cause or charitable
organization must be deposited and distributed in the same
manner as the fee imposed with respect to the conventional
version of the special license plate. A digital license plate which
replicates the appearance of a special license plate is valid for the
same length of time as the conventional version of the special
license plate. The Department may cease the use of digital license
plates which replicate the appearance of a special license plate
which the Department no longer issues in conventional form. If
the owner of a vehicle does not renew the digital license plate
which replicates the appearance of a special license plate or the
Department has ceased the use of the digital license plate which
replicates the appearance of a special license plate previously used
by the owner of a vehicle, the owner of a vehicle may continue to
use a digital license plate which does not replicate the appearance
of the special license plate.
6. The Department may authorize a digital license plate to
replicate the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate
issued pursuant to NRS 482.3667 by displaying a personalized
license plate code. The Department shall charge for the use of a
digital license plate that replicates the appearance of a
personalized prestige license plate the same fees which are
charged for the issuance and renewal of a conventional
personalized license plate. A digital license plate which replicates
the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate is valid for
the same length of time as a conventional personalized prestige
license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667. Any fees collected
-

– 6 –
pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions

to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
personalized prestige license plate.
7. The Department shall not charge any fee for the use of a
digital license plate or digital license plate device in excess of the
fees charged for a conventional license plate of the same type.
8. The Department shall adopt regulations:

information which may be stored on a digital license plate or
digital license plate device, which must be limited to that
information which is deemed necessary by the Department to

manufacturer or vendor to provide services to the owner of a
digital license plate device.
(b) Prescribing standards governing the use of digital license
plates and digital license plate devices, including, without
limitation:

differences between digital license plates or digital license plate
devices and conventional license plates, can have no application;

plates to the Department do not require the return or surrender of
