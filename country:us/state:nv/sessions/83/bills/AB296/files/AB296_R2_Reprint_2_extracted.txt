EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the
initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; prescribing
certain requirements for such installment loans;
authorizing the Director of the Department to authorize
the use of digital license plates; providing requirements
governing the use of digital license plates; revising the
applicability of certain provisions governing installment
lenders to a lender who contracts with the Department;
extending the prospective expiration of the pilot program
to gather data about annual vehicle miles traveled by
certain vehicles registered in this State; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
2 electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
3 through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
4 by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
5 means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
6 the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
7 this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
8 State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
9 office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
10 taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1)
11 requires the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and
12 taxes owed by vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2)
13 prohibits such a person from charging interest on an installment loan or charging a
-
*AB296_R2*
– 2 –
14 fee or combination of fees for the installment loan in excess of 15 percent of the
15 total amount financed; (3) prohibits the making of loans less than $250; and (4)
16 prohibits the person from rolling over or refinancing any installment loan made
17 pursuant to section 1 into any other loan to the vehicle owner.
18 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
19 whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
20 must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
21 Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
22 complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
23 digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
24 evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
25 visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
26 by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
27 (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
28 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
29 use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
30 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
31 authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
32 license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
33 a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
34 digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
35 plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
36 of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
37 prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds
38 the fee charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill
39 provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person
40 who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to require
41 the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
42 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
43 license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
44 license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
45 creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
46 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
47 electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
48 rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
49 5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
50 Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the
51 business of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS)
52 Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to
53 make loans to apply for a license for a place of business located outside this State.
54 Section 5.7 of this bill additionally authorizes such a person to conduct the business
55 of making loans within any office, suite, room or place of business in which any
56 other business is solicited or engaged in.
57 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
58 on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
59 (NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
60 certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
61 vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
62 initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
63 (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
64 expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
65 Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill extends the prospective
66 expiration of the pilot program until December 31, 2030.

7 the same length of time as a conventional personalized prestige
8 license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667. Any fees collected
9 pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
10 Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions
11 of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply with equal force
12 to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
13 personalized prestige license plate.

SECOND REPRINT A.B. 296
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 296–ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATTS
FEBRUARY 25, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to motor
vehicles. (BDR 43-231)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the
initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; prescribing
certain requirements for such installment loans;
authorizing the Director of the Department to authorize
the use of digital license plates; providing requirements
governing the use of digital license plates; revising the
applicability of certain provisions governing installment
lenders to a lender who contracts with the Department;
extending the prospective expiration of the pilot program
to gather data about annual vehicle miles traveled by
certain vehicles registered in this State; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
2 electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
3 through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
4 by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
5 means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
6 the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
7 this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
8 State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
9 office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
10 taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1)
11 requires the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and
12 taxes owed by vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2)
13 prohibits such a person from charging interest on an installment loan or charging a
-
*AB296_R2*

– 2 –
14 fee or combination of fees for the installment loan in excess of 15 percent of the
15 total amount financed; (3) prohibits the making of loans less than $250; and (4)
16 prohibits the person from rolling over or refinancing any installment loan made
17 pursuant to section 1 into any other loan to the vehicle owner.
18 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
19 whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
20 must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
21 Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
22 complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
23 digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
24 evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
25 visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
26 by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
27 (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
28 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
29 use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
30 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
31 authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
32 license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
33 a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
34 digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
35 plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
36 of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
37 prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds
38 the fee charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill
39 provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person
40 who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to require
41 the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
42 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
43 license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
44 license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
45 creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
46 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
47 electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
48 rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
49 5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
50 Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the
51 business of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS)
52 Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to
53 make loans to apply for a license for a place of business located outside this State.
54 Section 5.7 of this bill additionally authorizes such a person to conduct the business
55 of making loans within any office, suite, room or place of business in which any
56 other business is solicited or engaged in.
57 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
58 on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
59 (NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
60 certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
61 vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
62 initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
63 (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
64 expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
65 Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill extends the prospective
66 expiration of the pilot program until December 31, 2030.

5 requires to be presented in original form.

7 the registration of vehicles through an electronic branch office
8 consisting of an Internet website or software application, the
9 Department shall contract with a person who is licensed pursuant

17 subsection:

21 standard license plate. If the Department authorizes a digital
22 license plate to replicate the appearance of a special license plate,

27 generate financial support for a particular cause or charitable
28 organization must be deposited and distributed in the same
29 manner as the fee imposed with respect to the conventional

42 of the special license plate.

44 replicate the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate
45 issued pursuant to NRS 482.3667 by displaying a personalized

2 digital license plate that replicates the appearance of a
3 personalized prestige license plate the same fees which are
4 charged for the issuance and renewal of a conventional
5 personalized license plate. A digital license plate which replicates
6 the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate is valid for
7 the same length of time as a conventional personalized prestige
8 license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667. Any fees collected
9 pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
10 Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions
11 of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply with equal force
12 to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
13 personalized prestige license plate.
14 7. The Department shall not charge any fee for the use of a

23 manufacturer or vendor to provide services to the owner of a
24 digital license plate device.
25 (b) Prescribing standards governing the use of digital license
26 plates and digital license plate devices, including, without
27 limitation:

30 license plate.

33 Department to be appropriate and not contrary to the interests of
34 the public, emergency service alerts and personalized messages.
35 (4) The list of digital license plate devices which are
36 approved for use pursuant to this section.
37 (5) The procedure through which a person may apply to
38 use a digital license plate.
39 9. All provisions of this title relating to license plates apply to
40 digital license plates and digital license plate devices except:
41 (a) As otherwise specifically provided;
42 (b) As to those provisions which, owing to the physical
43 differences between digital license plates or digital license plate
44 devices and conventional license plates, can have no application;

22 Sec. 3. NRS 482.265 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 482.265 1. [The] Except as otherwise provided in subsection
24 5, the Department shall furnish to every owner whose vehicle is

26 motorcycle or moped and one license plate for all other vehicles
27 required to be registered hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in
28 NRS 482.2085 and 482.2155, or unless unnecessary because a
29 digital license plate has been authorized for use on the vehicle,
30 upon renewal of registration, the Department may issue one or more
31 license plate stickers, tabs or other suitable devices in lieu of new
32 license plates.
33 2. The Director shall have the authority to require the return to
34 the Department of all number plates upon termination of the lawful
35 use thereof by the owner under this chapter.
36 3. Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, for the
37 issuance of each special license plate authorized pursuant to this

– 8 –
1 which may be added to generate financial support for a particular
2 cause or charitable organization; and
3 (c) The Department shall not design, prepare or issue a special
4 license plate unless, within 4 years after the date on which the
5 measure authorizing the issuance becomes effective, it receives at
6 least 250 applications for the issuance of that plate.
7 4. The provisions of subsection 3 do not apply to
8 NRS 482.37901.
9 5. If, at the time of registration, the owner of a vehicle applies
10 to use a digital license plate on the vehicle pursuant to section 2 of
11 this act, the Department is not required to furnish a license plate
12 to the vehicle owner pursuant to subsection 1. If the owner of a
13 vehicle applies to use a digital license plate on a vehicle for which
14 a license plate was previously issued by the Department, the
15 Department may require the return to the Department of the
16 license plate or plates previously issued for the vehicle.
17 Sec. 4. NRS 482.267 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 482.267 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,]
19 and section 2 of this act, the Director shall utilize the facility for the
20 production of license plates which is located at the Department of
21 Corrections to produce all license plates required by the Department
22 of Motor Vehicles.
23 2. The Director may contract with a vendor for the production
24 of license plates which require technological or mechanical
25 processes which are not available at the facility.
26 Sec. 5. NRS 482.275 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 482.275 1. The license plates for a motor vehicle other than a
28 motorcycle, moped or motor vehicle being transported by a licensed
29 vehicle transporter must be attached thereto, one in the rear and,
30 except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,] or 3, one in the
31 front. The license plate issued for all other vehicles required to be
32 registered must be attached to the rear of the vehicle. The license
33 plates must be so displayed during the current calendar year or
34 registration period.
35 2. If the motor vehicle was not manufactured to include a
36 bracket, device or other contrivance to display and secure a front
37 license plate, and if the manufacturer of the motor vehicle provided
38 no other means or method by which a front license plate may be
39 displayed upon and secured to the motor vehicle:
40 (a) One license plate must be attached to the motor vehicle in
41 the rear; and
42 (b) The other license plate may, at the option of the owner of the
43 vehicle, be attached to the motor vehicle in the front.
44 3. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use on a
45 motor vehicle pursuant to section 2 of this act:

– 9 –
1 (a) The digital license plate device must be attached to the
2 motor vehicle in the rear; and
3 (b) No license plate is required to be attached to the motor

5 4. The provisions of subsection 2 do not relieve the
6 Department of the duty to issue a set of two license plates as
7 otherwise required pursuant to NRS 482.265 or other applicable law
8 and do not entitle the owner of a motor vehicle to pay a reduced tax
9 or fee in connection with the registration or transfer of the motor
10 vehicle. If the owner of a motor vehicle, in accordance with the
11 provisions of subsection 2, exercises the option to attach a license
12 plate only to the rear of the motor vehicle, the owner shall:
13 (a) Retain the other license plate; and
14 (b) Insofar as it may be practicable, return or surrender both
15 plates to the Department as a set when required by law to do so.
16 [4.] 5. Every license plate , including a digital license plate
17 device, must at all times be securely fastened to the vehicle to which
