AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to
contract with a person who makes installment loans to pay the fees and
taxes due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; prescribing
certain requirements for such installment loans; authorizing the
Director of the Department to authorize the use of digital license
plates; providing requirements governing the use of digital license
plates; revising the applicability of certain provisions governing
installment lenders to a lender who contracts with the Department;
extending the prospective expiration of the pilot program to gather
data about annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered
in this State; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish electronic branch
2 offices consisting of an Internet website or software application through which the
3 Department may conduct transactions that have been designated by the Director of the
4 Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic means. (NRS 481.055) If the
5 Department provides the ability to register or renew the registration of a vehicle through such
6 an electronic branch office, section 1 of this bill requires the Department to contract with a
7 person who is licensed in this State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the
8 electronic branch office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees
9 and taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1) requires
10 the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and taxes owed by
11 vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2) prohibits such a person
12 from charging interest on an installment loan or collecting an initial installment fee in excess
13 of $10 or a monthly installment fee in excess of $5 each month; [and] (3) prohibits the making
14 of loans less than $250 [.] ; and (4) prohibits the person from rolling over or refinancing
15 any installment loan made pursuant to section 1 into any other loan to the vehicle owner.
16 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner whose
17 vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates must be displayed
18 on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Director to permit the use of
19 digital license plates by a person who otherwise complies with the requirements for
20 registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a digital license plate to: (1) display the license
21 plate code assigned to the vehicle and evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet

Assembly Amendment No. 889 to Assembly Bill No. 296 First Reprint Page 4
22 certain requirements for visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has
23 been approved by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department;
24 and (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
25 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and use of
26 digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that may be stored on a
27 digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2 authorizes the Department to take
28 certain additional actions with respect to digital license plates, including: (1) approving banner
29 messages to appear on the bottom of a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes
30 of vehicles for which a digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of
31 digital license plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the
32 appearance of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
33 prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds the fee
34 charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill provides that the
35 Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person who applies to use a digital
36 license plate and authorizes the Department to require the return of license plates which were
37 previously issued for the vehicle.
38 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of license plates
39 which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all license plates required by the
40 Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception from this requirement
41 for the use of digital license plates.
42 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an electronic device
43 capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the rear of a motor vehicle. If a
44 digital license plate has been authorized for use, section 5 also excuses the requirement to
45 attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
46 Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the business
47 of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS) Section 5.3 of this bill
48 authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to make loans to apply for a license for
49 a place of business located outside this State. Section 5.7 of this bill additionally authorizes
50 such a person to conduct the business of making loans within any office, suite, room or place
51 of business in which any other business is solicited or engaged in.
52 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data on the
53 annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State. (NRS 482.2175) As
54 part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of certain motor vehicles to report
55 the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor vehicle and certain other information
56 required by the Department at the time of initial registration, renewal of registration and
57 transfer of registration, if applicable. (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions
58 providing for the pilot program expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of
59 chapter 498, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill [eliminates the
60 provision of law providing for] extends the prospective expiration of the pilot program [,
61 thereby requiring the continuation of the pilot program beyond] until December 31, [2026.]
62 2030.

29 of vehicles through an electronic branch office consisting of an Internet website

32 website or application, installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable
33 fees and taxes due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle, including,
34 without limitation, governmental services taxes, sales and use taxes due pursuant
35 to NRS 482.225, fees for license plates and registration fees. The person with
36 whom the Department contracts pursuant to this subsection:
37 (a) Must furnish to the Department, at the time of the initial or renewal
38 registration of a vehicle, the entire amount of the fees and taxes owed by the
39 vehicle owner to whom an installment loan is provided;

Assembly Amendment No. 889 to Assembly Bill No. 296 First Reprint Page 6

4 3. All digital license plates authorized for use pursuant to this section must:
5 (a) Display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle by the Department
6 and evidence of valid registration at all times, including, without limitation, when
7 the vehicle is in motion, stationary, parked or unoccupied.
8 (b) Be plainly readable by the human eye from a distance of 100 feet during

15 (a) Approve alternative banner messages to appear on the bottom of a digital

22 5. The Department may authorize digital license plates to replicate the
23 appearance of a license plate type other than a standard license plate. If the
24 Department authorizes a digital license plate to replicate the appearance of a
25 special license plate, the Department shall charge for the use or renewal of a
26 digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a special license plate the
27 same fees which are charged for the conventional version of the special license
28 plate. Any such fee which is imposed to generate financial support for a
29 particular cause or charitable organization must be deposited and distributed in
30 the same manner as the fee imposed with respect to the conventional version of
31 the special license plate. A digital license plate which replicates the appearance of
32 a special license plate is valid for the same length of time as the conventional
33 version of the special license plate. The Department may cease the use of digital
34 license plates which replicate the appearance of a special license plate which the
35 Department no longer issues in conventional form. If the owner of a vehicle does
36 not renew the digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a special
37 license plate or the Department has ceased the use of the digital license plate
38 which replicates the appearance of a special license plate previously used by the
39 owner of a vehicle, the owner of a vehicle may continue to use a digital license
40 plate which does not replicate the appearance of the special license plate.
41 6. The Department may authorize a digital license plate to replicate the
42 appearance of a personalized prestige license plate issued pursuant to NRS
43 482.3667 by displaying a personalized license plate code. The Department shall
44 charge for the use of a digital license plate that replicates the appearance of a
45 personalized prestige license plate the same fees which are charged for the
46 issuance and renewal of a conventional personalized license plate. A digital
47 license plate which replicates the appearance of a personalized prestige license
48 plate is valid for the same length of time as a conventional personalized prestige
49 license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667. Any fees collected pursuant to this
50 subsection must be deposited with the State Treasurer to the credit of the Motor
51 Vehicle Fund. The provisions of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply
52 with equal force to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
53 personalized prestige license plate.

Assembly Amendment No. 889 to Assembly Bill No. 296 First Reprint Page 7

2 plate or digital license plate device in excess of the fees charged for a
3 conventional license plate of the same type.

9 provide services to the owner of a digital license plate device.

11 digital license plate devices, including, without limitation:

15 plate, which may include, if determined by the Department to be appropriate and

17 personalized messages.
18 (4) The list of digital license plate devices which are approved for use
19 pursuant to this section.
20 (5) The procedure through which a person may apply to use a digital
21 license plate.
22 9. All provisions of this title relating to license plates apply to digital license
23 plates and digital license plate devices except:

25 (b) As to those provisions which, owing to the physical differences between
26 digital license plates or digital license plate devices and conventional license
27 plates, can have no application;

29 Department do not require the return or surrender of a digital license plate device
