EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the
initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; prescribing
certain requirements for such installment loans;
authorizing the Director of the Department to authorize
the use of digital license plates; providing requirements
governing the use of digital license plates; revising the
applicability of certain provisions governing installment
lenders to a lender who contracts with the Department;
extending the pilot program to gather data about annual
vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in
this State; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
2 electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
3 through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
4 by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
5 means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
6 the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
7 this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
8 State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
9 office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
10 taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1)
11 requires the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and
12 taxes owed by vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2)
13 prohibits such a person from charging interest on an installment loan or collecting
-
*AB296_R1*
– 2 –
14 an initial installment fee in excess of $10 or a monthly installment fee in excess of
15 $5 each month; and (3) prohibits the making of loans less than $250.
16 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
17 whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
18 must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
19 Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
20 complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
21 digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
22 evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
23 visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
24 by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
25 (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
26 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
27 use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
28 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
29 authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
30 license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
31 a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
32 digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
33 plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
34 of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
35 prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds
36 the fee charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill
37 provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person
38 who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to require
39 the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
40 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
41 license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
42 license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
43 creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
44 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
45 electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
46 rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
47 5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
48 Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the
49 business of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS)
50 Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to
51 make loans to apply for a license for a place of business located outside this State.
52 Section 5.7 of this bill additionally authorizes such a person to conduct the business
53 of making loans within any office, suite, room or place of business in which any
54 other business is solicited or engaged in.
55 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
56 on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
57 (NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
58 certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
59 vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
60 initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
61 (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
62 expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
63 Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the provision of law
64 providing for the expiration of the pilot program, thereby requiring the continuation
65 of the pilot program beyond December 31, 2026.

5 pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
6 Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions
7 of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply with equal force
8 to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
9 personalized prestige license plate.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 296
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 296–ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATTS
FEBRUARY 25, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to motor
vehicles. (BDR 43-231)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the
initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; prescribing
certain requirements for such installment loans;
authorizing the Director of the Department to authorize
the use of digital license plates; providing requirements
governing the use of digital license plates; revising the
applicability of certain provisions governing installment
lenders to a lender who contracts with the Department;
extending the pilot program to gather data about annual
vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in
this State; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
2 electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
3 through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
4 by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
5 means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
6 the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
7 this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
8 State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
9 office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
10 taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1)
11 requires the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and
12 taxes owed by vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2)
13 prohibits such a person from charging interest on an installment loan or collecting
-
*AB296_R1*

– 2 –
14 an initial installment fee in excess of $10 or a monthly installment fee in excess of
15 $5 each month; and (3) prohibits the making of loans less than $250.
16 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
17 whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
18 must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
19 Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
20 complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
21 digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
22 evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
23 visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
24 by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
25 (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
26 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
27 use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
28 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
29 authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
30 license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
31 a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
32 digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
33 plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
34 of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
35 prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds
36 the fee charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill
37 provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person
38 who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to require
39 the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
40 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
41 license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
42 license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
43 creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
44 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
45 electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
46 rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
47 5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
48 Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the
49 business of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS)
50 Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to
51 make loans to apply for a license for a place of business located outside this State.
52 Section 5.7 of this bill additionally authorizes such a person to conduct the business
53 of making loans within any office, suite, room or place of business in which any
54 other business is solicited or engaged in.
55 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
56 on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
57 (NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
58 certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
59 vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
60 initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
61 (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
62 expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
63 Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the provision of law
64 providing for the expiration of the pilot program, thereby requiring the continuation
65 of the pilot program beyond December 31, 2026.

2 electronic branch office which state or federal law specifically
3 requires to be conducted in person or accept documentation through
4 the electronic branch office which state or federal law specifically
5 requires to be presented in original form.
6 5. If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
7 the registration of vehicles through an electronic branch office
8 consisting of an Internet website or software application, the
9 Department shall contract with a person who is licensed pursuant
10 to chapter 675 of NRS to allow the person to offer, through the
11 website or application, installment loans to vehicle owners to pay
12 the applicable fees and taxes due for the initial or renewal
13 registration of a vehicle, including, without limitation,
14 governmental services taxes, sales and use taxes due pursuant to
15 NRS 482.225, fees for license plates and registration fees. The
16 person with whom the Department contracts pursuant to this
17 subsection:

2 approved by the Department and purchased from a vendor
3 approved by the Department.

15 5. The Department may authorize digital license plates to
16 replicate the appearance of a license plate type other than a
17 standard license plate. If the Department authorizes a digital
18 license plate to replicate the appearance of a special license plate,
19 the Department shall charge for the use or renewal of a digital
20 license plate which replicates the appearance of a special license
21 plate the same fees which are charged for the conventional version
22 of the special license plate. Any such fee which is imposed to
23 generate financial support for a particular cause or charitable
24 organization must be deposited and distributed in the same
25 manner as the fee imposed with respect to the conventional
26 version of the special license plate. A digital license plate which
27 replicates the appearance of a special license plate is valid for the
28 same length of time as the conventional version of the special
29 license plate. The Department may cease the use of digital license
30 plates which replicate the appearance of a special license plate
31 which the Department no longer issues in conventional form. If
32 the owner of a vehicle does not renew the digital license plate
33 which replicates the appearance of a special license plate or the
34 Department has ceased the use of the digital license plate which
35 replicates the appearance of a special license plate previously used
36 by the owner of a vehicle, the owner of a vehicle may continue to
37 use a digital license plate which does not replicate the appearance
38 of the special license plate.
39 6. The Department may authorize a digital license plate to
40 replicate the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate
41 issued pursuant to NRS 482.3667 by displaying a personalized
42 license plate code. The Department shall charge for the use of a
43 digital license plate that replicates the appearance of a
44 personalized prestige license plate the same fees which are
45 charged for the issuance and renewal of a conventional
-
*AB296_R1*

– 6 –
1 personalized license plate. A digital license plate which replicates
2 the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate is valid for
3 the same length of time as a conventional personalized prestige
4 license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667. Any fees collected
5 pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
6 Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions
7 of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply with equal force
8 to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
9 personalized prestige license plate.
10 7. The Department shall not charge any fee for the use of a
11 digital license plate or digital license plate device in excess of the
12 fees charged for a conventional license plate of the same type.
13 8. The Department shall adopt regulations:
14 (a) Prescribing standards for the personally identifiable
15 information which may be stored on a digital license plate or
16 digital license plate device, which must be limited to that
17 information which is deemed necessary by the Department to
18 display evidence of registration compliance or for the
19 manufacturer or vendor to provide services to the owner of a
20 digital license plate device.
21 (b) Prescribing standards governing the use of digital license
22 plates and digital license plate devices, including, without
23 limitation:
24 (1) Protocols for data sharing, privacy and security.
25 (2) Information which must be displayed on a digital
26 license plate.
27 (3) Information and images which may be displayed on a
28 digital license plate, which may include, if determined by the
29 Department to be appropriate and not contrary to the interests of
30 the public, emergency service alerts and personalized messages.
31 (4) The list of digital license plate devices which are
32 approved for use pursuant to this section.
33 (5) The procedure through which a person may apply to
34 use a digital license plate.
35 9. All provisions of this title relating to license plates apply to
36 digital license plates and digital license plate devices except:
37 (a) As otherwise specifically provided;
38 (b) As to those provisions which, owing to the physical
39 differences between digital license plates or digital license plate
40 devices and conventional license plates, can have no application;
41 (c) Provisions requiring the return or surrender of license
42 plates to the Department do not require the return or surrender of
43 a digital license plate device which was not purchased from the
44 Department; and
-

14 numbers, letters or both numbers and letters appearing on the face
15 of a license plate.
16 (d) “Special license plate” means a special license plate issued
17 pursuant to NRS 482.3667 to 482.3823, inclusive.
18 Sec. 3. NRS 482.265 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 482.265 1. [The] Except as otherwise provided in subsection
20 5, the Department shall furnish to every owner whose vehicle is
21 registered two license plates for a motor vehicle other than a
22 motorcycle or moped and one license plate for all other vehicles
23 required to be registered hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in
24 NRS 482.2085 and 482.2155, or unless unnecessary because a
25 digital license plate has been authorized for use on the vehicle,
26 upon renewal of registration, the Department may issue one or more
27 license plate stickers, tabs or other suitable devices in lieu of new
28 license plates.
29 2. The Director shall have the authority to require the return to
30 the Department of all number plates upon termination of the lawful
31 use thereof by the owner under this chapter.
32 3. Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, for the
33 issuance of each special license plate authorized pursuant to this
34 chapter:

36 issuance of the special license plate is $35, exclusive of any
37 additional fee which may be added to generate funds for a particular
38 cause or charitable organization;
39 (b) The fee to be received by the Department for the renewal of
40 the special license plate is $10, exclusive of any additional fee
41 which may be added to generate financial support for a particular
42 cause or charitable organization; and
43 (c) The Department shall not design, prepare or issue a special
44 license plate unless, within 4 years after the date on which the
-
*AB296_R1*

– 8 –
1 measure authorizing the issuance becomes effective, it receives at
2 least 250 applications for the issuance of that plate.
3 4. The provisions of subsection 3 do not apply to
4 NRS 482.37901.
5 5. If, at the time of registration, the owner of a vehicle applies
6 to use a digital license plate on the vehicle pursuant to section 2 of
7 this act, the Department is not required to furnish a license plate
8 to the vehicle owner pursuant to subsection 1. If the owner of a
9 vehicle applies to use a digital license plate on a vehicle for which
10 a license plate was previously issued by the Department, the
11 Department may require the return to the Department of the
12 license plate or plates previously issued for the vehicle.
13 Sec. 4. NRS 482.267 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 482.267 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,]
15 and section 2 of this act, the Director shall utilize the facility for the
16 production of license plates which is located at the Department of
17 Corrections to produce all license plates required by the Department
18 of Motor Vehicles.
19 2. The Director may contract with a vendor for the production
20 of license plates which require technological or mechanical
21 processes which are not available at the facility.
22 Sec. 5. NRS 482.275 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 482.275 1. The license plates for a motor vehicle other than a
24 motorcycle, moped or motor vehicle being transported by a licensed
25 vehicle transporter must be attached thereto, one in the rear and,
26 except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,] or 3, one in the
27 front. The license plate issued for all other vehicles required to be
28 registered must be attached to the rear of the vehicle. The license
29 plates must be so displayed during the current calendar year or
30 registration period.
31 2. If the motor vehicle was not manufactured to include a
32 bracket, device or other contrivance to display and secure a front
33 license plate, and if the manufacturer of the motor vehicle provided
34 no other means or method by which a front license plate may be
35 displayed upon and secured to the motor vehicle:
36 (a) One license plate must be attached to the motor vehicle in
37 the rear; and
38 (b) The other license plate may, at the option of the owner of the
39 vehicle, be attached to the motor vehicle in the front.
40 3. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use on a
41 motor vehicle pursuant to section 2 of this act:

43 motor vehicle in the rear; and
44 (b) No license plate is required to be attached to the motor

-
*AB296_R1*

– 9 –
1 4. The provisions of subsection 2 do not relieve the
2 Department of the duty to issue a set of two license plates as
3 otherwise required pursuant to NRS 482.265 or other applicable law
4 and do not entitle the owner of a motor vehicle to pay a reduced tax
5 or fee in connection with the registration or transfer of the motor
6 vehicle. If the owner of a motor vehicle, in accordance with the
7 provisions of subsection 2, exercises the option to attach a license
8 plate only to the rear of the motor vehicle, the owner shall:
9 (a) Retain the other license plate; and
10 (b) Insofar as it may be practicable, return or surrender both
11 plates to the Department as a set when required by law to do so.
12 [4.] 5. Every license plate , including a digital license plate
13 device, must at all times be securely fastened to the vehicle to which
14 it is assigned so as to prevent the plate from swinging and at a
15 height not less than 12 inches from the ground, measuring from the
16 bottom of such plate, in a place and position to be clearly visible,
17 and must be maintained free from foreign materials and in a
18 condition to be clearly legible.
19 [5.] 6. Any license plate which is issued to a vehicle
20 transporter or a dealer, rebuilder or manufacturer may be attached to
21 a vehicle owned or controlled by that person by a secure means. No
22 license plate may be displayed loosely in the window or by any
23 other unsecured method in any motor vehicle.
