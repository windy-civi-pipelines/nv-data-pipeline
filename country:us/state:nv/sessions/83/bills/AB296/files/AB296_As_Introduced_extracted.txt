SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to motor
vehicles. (BDR 43-231)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the
initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; authorizing the
Director of the Department to authorize the use of digital
license plates; providing requirements governing the use
of digital license plates; extending the pilot program to
gather data about annual vehicle miles traveled by certain
vehicles registered in this State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
2 electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
3 through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
4 by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
5 means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
6 the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
7 this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
8 State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
9 office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
10 taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle.
11 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
12 whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
13 must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
14 Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
15 complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
16 digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
17 evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
18 visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
-
*AB296*
– 2 –
19 by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
20 (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
21 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
22 use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
23 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
24 authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
25 license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
26 a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
27 digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
28 plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
29 of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 3 of
30 this bill provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a
31 person who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to
32 require the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
33 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
34 license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
35 license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
36 creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
37 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
38 electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
39 rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
40 5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
41 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
42 on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
43 (NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
44 certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
45 vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
46 initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
47 (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
48 expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
49 Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the provision of law
50 providing for the expiration of the pilot program, thereby requiring the continuation
51 of the pilot program beyond December 31, 2026.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Sec. 2. Chapter 482 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. The Director may authorize the use of digital license plates
4 in accordance with this section upon application by a person who
5 otherwise complies with the requirements for registration and
6 licensing pursuant to this chapter.
7 2. The use of a digital license plate must be voluntary and the
8 Department shall not require any person to use or install a digital
9 license plate or digital license plate device.
10 3. All digital license plates authorized for use pursuant to this
11 section must:
12 (a) Display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle by the
13 Department and evidence of valid registration at all times,
14 including, without limitation, when the vehicle is in motion,
15 stationary, parked or unoccupied.
16 (b) Be plainly readable by the human eye from a distance of
17 100 feet during daylight and darkness.
18 (c) Be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been
19 approved by the Department and purchased from a vendor
20 approved by the Department.
21 (d) Display only information and images required or
22 authorized for display by the Department.
23 4. The Department may:
24 (a) Approve alternative banner messages to appear on the
25 bottom of a digital license plate.
26 (b) Authorize the sale or resale of digital license plate devices
27 by a device manufacturer or by participating vendors, subject to
28 review and approval by the Department.
29 (c) By regulation, restrict the types or classes of vehicles for
30 which the Department will authorize the use of a digital license
31 plate.
32 5. The Department may authorize digital license plates to
33 replicate the appearance of a license plate type other than a
34 standard license plate. If the Department authorizes a digital
35 license plate to replicate the appearance of a special license plate,
36 the Department shall charge for the use of a digital license plate
37 which replicates the appearance of a special license plate, in
38 addition to all other applicable registration and license fees and
39 governmental services taxes, only the additional fee for the initial
40 issuance or renewal of the special license plate, as applicable,
41 which is imposed to generate financial support for a particular
42 cause or charitable organization. Any such fee must be deposited
43 and distributed in the same manner as the fee imposed with
44 respect to the conventional version of the special license plate. A
45 digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a special
-
*AB296*
– 5 –
1 license plate is valid for the same length of time as the
2 conventional version of the special license plate. A digital license
3 plate which replicates the appearance of a special license plate is
4 renewable upon payment of any required fee imposed to generate
5 financial support for a particular cause or charitable
6 organization, except that the Department may cease the use of
7 digital license plates which replicate the appearance of a special
8 license plate which the Department no longer issues in
9 conventional form. If the owner of a vehicle does not renew the
10 digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a special
11 license plate or the Department has ceased the use of the digital
12 license plate which replicates the appearance of a special license
13 plate previously used by the owner of a vehicle, the owner of a
14 vehicle may continue to use a digital license plate which does not
15 replicate the appearance of the special license plate.
16 6. The Department may authorize a digital license plate to
17 replicate the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate
18 issued pursuant to NRS 482.3667 by displaying a personalized
19 license plate code. The Department may impose a reasonable fee
20 to authorize and renew the use of a digital license plate that
21 replicates the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate,
22 which fee must be designed to defray the administrative costs to
23 the Department to review and approve the personalized license
24 plate code but not include any amount which is normally charged
25 for a conventional personalized prestige license plate to defray the
26 costs of manufacturing the plate. A digital license plate which
27 replicates the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate is
28 valid for the same length of time as a conventional personalized
29 prestige license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667 and is
30 renewable upon payment of the required fee. Any fees collected
31 pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
32 Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions
33 of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply with equal force
34 to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
35 personalized prestige license plate.
36 7. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 5 and 6, the
37 Department shall not charge any additional fee for the use of a
38 digital license plate or digital license plate device in excess of any
39 applicable registration and license fee and governmental services
40 taxes.
41 8. The Department shall adopt regulations:
42 (a) Prescribing standards for the personally identifiable
43 information which may be stored on a digital license plate or
44 digital license plate device, which must be limited to that
45 information which is deemed necessary by the Department to
-
*AB296*
– 6 –
1 display evidence of registration compliance or for the
2 manufacturer or vendor to provide services to the owner of a
3 digital license plate device.
4 (b) Prescribing standards governing the use of digital license
5 plates and digital license plate devices, including, without
6 limitation:
7 (1) Protocols for data sharing, privacy and security.
8 (2) Information which must be displayed on a digital
9 license plate.
10 (3) Information and images which may be displayed on a
11 digital license plate, which may include, if determined by the
12 Department to be appropriate and not contrary to the interests of
13 the public, emergency service alerts and personalized messages.
14 (4) The list of digital license plate devices which are
15 approved for use pursuant to this section.
16 (5) The procedure through which a person may apply to
17 use a digital license plate.
18 9. All provisions of this title relating to license plates apply to
19 digital license plates and digital license plate devices except:
20 (a) As otherwise specifically provided;
21 (b) As to those provisions which, owing to the physical
22 differences between digital license plates or digital license plate
23 devices and conventional license plates, can have no application;
24 (c) Provisions requiring the return or surrender of license
25 plates to the Department do not require the return or surrender of
26 a digital license plate device which was not purchased from the
27 Department; and
28 (d) The provisions of NRS 482.270 do not apply to a digital
29 license plate or digital license plate device.
30 10. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Digital license plate” means a digital image displayed on
32 a digital license plate device that includes the license plate code
33 assigned to the vehicle and any other information or images which
34 the Department may authorize or require by regulation.
35 (b) “Digital license plate device” means an electronic device
36 capable of:
37 (1) Being mounted to a motor vehicle in accordance with
38 the requirements for motor vehicle license plates; and
39 (2) Displaying a digital license plate.
40 (c) “License plate code” means the unique combination of
41 numbers, letters or both numbers and letters appearing on the face
42 of a license plate.
43 (d) “Special license plate” means a special license plate issued

30 4. The provisions of subsection 3 do not apply to
31 NRS 482.37901.
32 5. If, at the time of registration, the owner of a vehicle applies
33 to use a digital license plate on the vehicle pursuant to section 2 of
34 this act, the Department is not required to furnish a license plate
35 to the vehicle owner pursuant to subsection 1. If the owner of a
36 vehicle applies to use a digital license plate on a vehicle for which
37 a license plate was previously issued by the Department, the
38 Department may require the return to the Department of the
39 license plate or plates previously issued for the vehicle.
40 Sec. 4. NRS 482.267 is hereby amended to read as follows:

10 registered must be attached to the rear of the vehicle. The license
11 plates must be so displayed during the current calendar year or
12 registration period.
13 2. If the motor vehicle was not manufactured to include a
14 bracket, device or other contrivance to display and secure a front

31 and do not entitle the owner of a motor vehicle to pay a reduced tax
32 or fee in connection with the registration or transfer of the motor

40 device, must at all times be securely fastened to the vehicle to which
41 it is assigned so as to prevent the plate from swinging and at a
42 height not less than 12 inches from the ground, measuring from the

A.B. 296
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 296–ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATTS
FEBRUARY 25, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to motor
vehicles. (BDR 43-231)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to contract with a person who makes
installment loans to pay the fees and taxes due for the
initial or renewal registration of a vehicle; authorizing the
Director of the Department to authorize the use of digital
license plates; providing requirements governing the use
of digital license plates; extending the pilot program to
gather data about annual vehicle miles traveled by certain
vehicles registered in this State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish
2 electronic branch offices consisting of an Internet website or software application
3 through which the Department may conduct transactions that have been designated
4 by the Director of the Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic
5 means. (NRS 481.055) If the Department provides the ability to register or renew
6 the registration of a vehicle through such an electronic branch office, section 1 of
7 this bill requires the Department to contract with a person who is licensed in this
8 State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the electronic branch
9 office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees and
10 taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle.
11 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner
12 whose vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates
13 must be displayed on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
14 Director to permit the use of digital license plates by a person who otherwise
15 complies with the requirements for registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a
16 digital license plate to: (1) display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle and
17 evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet certain requirements for
18 visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been approved
-
*AB296*

– 2 –
19 by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department; and
20 (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
21 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and
22 use of digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that
23 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2
24 authorizes the Department to take certain additional actions with respect to digital
25 license plates, including: (1) approving banner messages to appear on the bottom of
26 a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes of vehicles for which a
27 digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of digital license
28 plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the appearance
29 of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 3 of
30 this bill provides that the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a
31 person who applies to use a digital license plate and authorizes the Department to
32 require the return of license plates which were previously issued for the vehicle.
33 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of
34 license plates which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all
35 license plates required by the Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill
36 creates an exception from this requirement for the use of digital license plates.
37 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an
38 electronic device capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the
39 rear of a motor vehicle. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use, section
40 5 also excuses the requirement to attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
41 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data
42 on the annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State.
43 (NRS 482.2175) As part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of
44 certain motor vehicles to report the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor
45 vehicle and certain other information required by the Department at the time of
46 initial registration, renewal of registration and transfer of registration, if applicable.
47 (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions providing for the pilot program
48 expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of chapter 498, Statutes of
49 Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the provision of law
50 providing for the expiration of the pilot program, thereby requiring the continuation
51 of the pilot program beyond December 31, 2026.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

43 registration of a vehicle, including, without limitation,

1 Sec. 2. Chapter 482 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. The Director may authorize the use of digital license plates
4 in accordance with this section upon application by a person who
5 otherwise complies with the requirements for registration and
6 licensing pursuant to this chapter.
7 2. The use of a digital license plate must be voluntary and the
8 Department shall not require any person to use or install a digital
9 license plate or digital license plate device.
10 3. All digital license plates authorized for use pursuant to this
11 section must:
12 (a) Display the license plate code assigned to the vehicle by the
13 Department and evidence of valid registration at all times,
14 including, without limitation, when the vehicle is in motion,
15 stationary, parked or unoccupied.
16 (b) Be plainly readable by the human eye from a distance of
17 100 feet during daylight and darkness.
18 (c) Be displayed on a digital license plate device that has been
19 approved by the Department and purchased from a vendor
20 approved by the Department.
21 (d) Display only information and images required or
22 authorized for display by the Department.
23 4. The Department may:
24 (a) Approve alternative banner messages to appear on the
25 bottom of a digital license plate.
26 (b) Authorize the sale or resale of digital license plate devices
27 by a device manufacturer or by participating vendors, subject to
28 review and approval by the Department.
29 (c) By regulation, restrict the types or classes of vehicles for
30 which the Department will authorize the use of a digital license
31 plate.
32 5. The Department may authorize digital license plates to
33 replicate the appearance of a license plate type other than a
34 standard license plate. If the Department authorizes a digital
35 license plate to replicate the appearance of a special license plate,
36 the Department shall charge for the use of a digital license plate
37 which replicates the appearance of a special license plate, in
38 addition to all other applicable registration and license fees and
39 governmental services taxes, only the additional fee for the initial
40 issuance or renewal of the special license plate, as applicable,
41 which is imposed to generate financial support for a particular
42 cause or charitable organization. Any such fee must be deposited
43 and distributed in the same manner as the fee imposed with
44 respect to the conventional version of the special license plate. A
45 digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a special
-
*AB296*

– 5 –
1 license plate is valid for the same length of time as the
2 conventional version of the special license plate. A digital license
3 plate which replicates the appearance of a special license plate is
4 renewable upon payment of any required fee imposed to generate
5 financial support for a particular cause or charitable
6 organization, except that the Department may cease the use of
7 digital license plates which replicate the appearance of a special
8 license plate which the Department no longer issues in
9 conventional form. If the owner of a vehicle does not renew the
10 digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a special
11 license plate or the Department has ceased the use of the digital
12 license plate which replicates the appearance of a special license
13 plate previously used by the owner of a vehicle, the owner of a
14 vehicle may continue to use a digital license plate which does not
15 replicate the appearance of the special license plate.
16 6. The Department may authorize a digital license plate to
17 replicate the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate
18 issued pursuant to NRS 482.3667 by displaying a personalized
19 license plate code. The Department may impose a reasonable fee
20 to authorize and renew the use of a digital license plate that
21 replicates the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate,
22 which fee must be designed to defray the administrative costs to
23 the Department to review and approve the personalized license
24 plate code but not include any amount which is normally charged
25 for a conventional personalized prestige license plate to defray the
26 costs of manufacturing the plate. A digital license plate which
27 replicates the appearance of a personalized prestige license plate is
28 valid for the same length of time as a conventional personalized
29 prestige license plate as provided in NRS 482.3667 and is
30 renewable upon payment of the required fee. Any fees collected
31 pursuant to this subsection must be deposited with the State
32 Treasurer to the credit of the Motor Vehicle Fund. The provisions
33 of subsections 5, 6 and 7 of NRS 482.3667 apply with equal force
34 to a digital license plate which replicates the appearance of a
35 personalized prestige license plate.
36 7. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 5 and 6, the
37 Department shall not charge any additional fee for the use of a
38 digital license plate or digital license plate device in excess of any
39 applicable registration and license fee and governmental services
40 taxes.
41 8. The Department shall adopt regulations:
42 (a) Prescribing standards for the personally identifiable
43 information which may be stored on a digital license plate or
44 digital license plate device, which must be limited to that
45 information which is deemed necessary by the Department to
-
*AB296*

– 6 –
1 display evidence of registration compliance or for the
2 manufacturer or vendor to provide services to the owner of a
3 digital license plate device.
4 (b) Prescribing standards governing the use of digital license
5 plates and digital license plate devices, including, without
6 limitation:
7 (1) Protocols for data sharing, privacy and security.
8 (2) Information which must be displayed on a digital
9 license plate.
10 (3) Information and images which may be displayed on a
11 digital license plate, which may include, if determined by the
12 Department to be appropriate and not contrary to the interests of
13 the public, emergency service alerts and personalized messages.
14 (4) The list of digital license plate devices which are
15 approved for use pursuant to this section.
16 (5) The procedure through which a person may apply to
17 use a digital license plate.
18 9. All provisions of this title relating to license plates apply to
19 digital license plates and digital license plate devices except:
20 (a) As otherwise specifically provided;
21 (b) As to those provisions which, owing to the physical
22 differences between digital license plates or digital license plate
23 devices and conventional license plates, can have no application;
24 (c) Provisions requiring the return or surrender of license
25 plates to the Department do not require the return or surrender of
26 a digital license plate device which was not purchased from the
27 Department; and
28 (d) The provisions of NRS 482.270 do not apply to a digital
29 license plate or digital license plate device.
30 10. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Digital license plate” means a digital image displayed on
32 a digital license plate device that includes the license plate code
33 assigned to the vehicle and any other information or images which
34 the Department may authorize or require by regulation.
35 (b) “Digital license plate device” means an electronic device
36 capable of:
37 (1) Being mounted to a motor vehicle in accordance with
38 the requirements for motor vehicle license plates; and
39 (2) Displaying a digital license plate.
40 (c) “License plate code” means the unique combination of
41 numbers, letters or both numbers and letters appearing on the face
42 of a license plate.
43 (d) “Special license plate” means a special license plate issued
44 pursuant to NRS 482.3667 to 482.3823, inclusive.

3 5, the Department shall furnish to every owner whose vehicle is
4 registered two license plates for a motor vehicle other than a
5 motorcycle or moped and one license plate for all other vehicles
6 required to be registered hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in
7 NRS 482.2085 and 482.2155, or unless unnecessary because a
8 digital license plate has been authorized for use on the vehicle,
9 upon renewal of registration, the Department may issue one or more
10 license plate stickers, tabs or other suitable devices in lieu of new
11 license plates.
12 2. The Director shall have the authority to require the return to
13 the Department of all number plates upon termination of the lawful
14 use thereof by the owner under this chapter.
15 3. Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, for the
16 issuance of each special license plate authorized pursuant to this
17 chapter:
18 (a) The fee to be received by the Department for the initial
19 issuance of the special license plate is $35, exclusive of any
20 additional fee which may be added to generate funds for a particular
21 cause or charitable organization;
22 (b) The fee to be received by the Department for the renewal of
23 the special license plate is $10, exclusive of any additional fee
24 which may be added to generate financial support for a particular
25 cause or charitable organization; and
26 (c) The Department shall not design, prepare or issue a special
27 license plate unless, within 4 years after the date on which the
28 measure authorizing the issuance becomes effective, it receives at
29 least 250 applications for the issuance of that plate.
30 4. The provisions of subsection 3 do not apply to
31 NRS 482.37901.
32 5. If, at the time of registration, the owner of a vehicle applies
33 to use a digital license plate on the vehicle pursuant to section 2 of
34 this act, the Department is not required to furnish a license plate
35 to the vehicle owner pursuant to subsection 1. If the owner of a
36 vehicle applies to use a digital license plate on a vehicle for which
37 a license plate was previously issued by the Department, the
38 Department may require the return to the Department of the
39 license plate or plates previously issued for the vehicle.
40 Sec. 4. NRS 482.267 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 482.267 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,]
42 and section 2 of this act, the Director shall utilize the facility for the
43 production of license plates which is located at the Department of
44 Corrections to produce all license plates required by the Department
45 of Motor Vehicles.
-
*AB296*

– 8 –
1 2. The Director may contract with a vendor for the production
2 of license plates which require technological or mechanical
3 processes which are not available at the facility.
4 Sec. 5. NRS 482.275 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 482.275 1. The license plates for a motor vehicle other than a
6 motorcycle, moped or motor vehicle being transported by a licensed
7 vehicle transporter must be attached thereto, one in the rear and,
8 except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,] or 3, one in the
9 front. The license plate issued for all other vehicles required to be
10 registered must be attached to the rear of the vehicle. The license
11 plates must be so displayed during the current calendar year or
12 registration period.
13 2. If the motor vehicle was not manufactured to include a
14 bracket, device or other contrivance to display and secure a front
15 license plate, and if the manufacturer of the motor vehicle provided
16 no other means or method by which a front license plate may be
17 displayed upon and secured to the motor vehicle:
18 (a) One license plate must be attached to the motor vehicle in
19 the rear; and
20 (b) The other license plate may, at the option of the owner of the
21 vehicle, be attached to the motor vehicle in the front.
22 3. If a digital license plate has been authorized for use on a

24 (a) The digital license plate device must be attached to the
25 motor vehicle in the rear; and
26 (b) No license plate is required to be attached to the motor
27 vehicle in the front.
28 4. The provisions of subsection 2 do not relieve the
29 Department of the duty to issue a set of two license plates as
30 otherwise required pursuant to NRS 482.265 or other applicable law
31 and do not entitle the owner of a motor vehicle to pay a reduced tax
32 or fee in connection with the registration or transfer of the motor
33 vehicle. If the owner of a motor vehicle, in accordance with the
34 provisions of subsection 2, exercises the option to attach a license
35 plate only to the rear of the motor vehicle, the owner shall:
36 (a) Retain the other license plate; and
37 (b) Insofar as it may be practicable, return or surrender both
38 plates to the Department as a set when required by law to do so.
39 [4.] 5. Every license plate , including a digital license plate
40 device, must at all times be securely fastened to the vehicle to which
41 it is assigned so as to prevent the plate from swinging and at a
42 height not less than 12 inches from the ground, measuring from the
43 bottom of such plate, in a place and position to be clearly visible,
44 and must be maintained free from foreign materials and in a
45 condition to be clearly legible.

8 Sec. 7. 1. This section and section 6.5 of this act
9 become effective on July 1, 2019.
