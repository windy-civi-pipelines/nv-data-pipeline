AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to
contract with a person who makes installment loans to pay the fees and
taxes due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle;
prescribing certain requirements for such installment loans;
authorizing the Director of the Department to authorize the use of
digital license plates; providing requirements governing the use of
digital license plates; revising the applicability of certain provisions
governing installment lenders to a lender who contracts with the
Department; extending the pilot program to gather data about annual
vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to establish electronic branch
2 offices consisting of an Internet website or software application through which the
3 Department may conduct transactions that have been designated by the Director of the
4 Department as suitable to be conducted through electronic means. (NRS 481.055) If the
5 Department provides the ability to register or renew the registration of a vehicle through such
6 an electronic branch office, section 1 of this bill requires the Department to contract with a
7 person who is licensed in this State to make installment loans to allow the person, through the
8 electronic branch office, to offer installment loans to vehicle owners to pay the applicable fees
9 and taxes that are due for the initial or renewal registration of a vehicle. Section 1: (1)
10 requires the person to furnish to the Department the entire amount of the fees and taxes
11 owed by vehicle owners for the registration and renewal of registration; (2) prohibits
12 such a person from charging interest on an installment loan or collecting an initial
13 installment fee in excess of $10 or a monthly installment fee in excess of $5 each month;
14 and (3) prohibits the making of loans less than $250.
15 Existing law requires the Department to furnish license plates to every owner whose
16 vehicle is registered and sets forth the manner in which such license plates must be displayed
17 on a vehicle. (NRS 482.265) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Director to permit the use of
18 digital license plates by a person who otherwise complies with the requirements for
19 registration and licensing. Section 2 requires a digital license plate to: (1) display the license
20 plate code assigned to the vehicle and evidence of valid registration at all times; (2) meet
21 certain requirements for visibility; (3) be displayed on a digital license plate device that has

Assembly Amendment No. 318 to Assembly Bill No. 296 Page 4
22 been approved by the Department and purchased from a vendor approved by the Department;
23 and (4) display only information and images required or authorized by the Department.
24 Section 2 requires the Department to adopt regulations relating to the issuance and use of
25 digital license plates, including the personally identifiable information that may be stored on a
26 digital license plate or digital license plate device. Section 2 authorizes the Department to take
27 certain additional actions with respect to digital license plates, including: (1) approving banner
28 messages to appear on the bottom of a digital license plate; (2) restricting the types or classes
29 of vehicles for which a digital license plate may be used; (3) authorizing the sale or resale of
30 digital license plate devices; and (4) authorizing digital license plates to replicate the
31 appearance of certain special license plates or personalized prestige license plates. Section 2
32 prohibits the Department from charging a fee for digital license plates that exceeds the
33 fee charged for a conventional plate of the same type. Section 3 of this bill provides that
34 the Department is not required to furnish license plates to a person who applies to use a digital
35 license plate and authorizes the Department to require the return of license plates which were
36 previously issued for the vehicle.
37 Existing law requires the Director to utilize the facility for the production of license plates
38 which is located at the Department of Corrections to produce all license plates required by the
39 Department. (NRS 482.267) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception from this requirement
40 for the use of digital license plates.
41 Section 5 of this bill requires a digital license plate device, which is an electronic device
42 capable of displaying a digital license plate, to be attached to the rear of a motor vehicle. If a
43 digital license plate has been authorized for use, section 5 also excuses the requirement to
44 attach a license plate to the front of the vehicle.
45 Existing law establishes a procedure for the licensing of persons engaged in the
46 business of making and collecting on installment loans. (Chapter 675 of NRS) Section 5.3
47 of this bill authorizes a person who contracts with the Department to make loans to
48 apply for a license for a place of business located outside this State. Section 5.7 of this bill
49 additionally authorizes such a person to conduct the business of making loans within any
50 office, suite, room or place of business in which any other business is solicited or engaged
51 in.
52 Existing law requires the Department to conduct a pilot program to gather data on the
53 annual vehicle miles traveled by certain vehicles registered in this State. (NRS 482.2175) As
54 part of the pilot program, existing law requires the owners of certain motor vehicles to report
55 the mileage shown on the odometer of the motor vehicle and certain other information
56 required by the Department at the time of initial registration, renewal of registration and
57 transfer of registration, if applicable. (NRS 482.2177) Under existing law, the provisions
58 providing for the pilot program expire by limitation on December 31, 2026. (Section 7 of
59 chapter 498, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 3006) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the
60 provision of law providing for the expiration of the pilot program, thereby requiring the
61 continuation of the pilot program beyond December 31, 2026.

29 Any such fee] must be deposited and distributed in the same manner as the fee

39 plate which replicates the appearance of a special license plate or the Department
40 has ceased the use of the digital license plate which replicates the appearance of

10 Department shall not charge any [additional] fee for the use of a digital license
11 plate or digital license plate device in excess of [any applicable registration and

13 license plate of the same type.
14 8. The Department shall adopt regulations:
15 (a) Prescribing standards for the personally identifiable information which
16 may be stored on a digital license plate or digital license plate device, which must

44 moped or motor vehicle being transported by a licensed vehicle transporter must be
45 attached thereto, one in the rear and, except as otherwise provided in subsection 2

5 (a) The digital license plate device must be attached to the motor vehicle in
6 the rear; and
7 (b) No license plate is required to be attached to the motor vehicle in the

9 4. The provisions of subsection 2 do not relieve the Department of the duty to
10 issue a set of two license plates as otherwise required pursuant to NRS 482.265 or
11 other applicable law and do not entitle the owner of a motor vehicle to pay a
12 reduced tax or fee in connection with the registration or transfer of the motor
13 vehicle. If the owner of a motor vehicle, in accordance with the provisions of
14 subsection 2, exercises the option to attach a license plate only to the rear of the
15 motor vehicle, the owner shall:
16 (a) Retain the other license plate; and
17 (b) Insofar as it may be practicable, return or surrender both plates to the

21 the plate from swinging and at a height not less than 12 inches from the ground,
22 measuring from the bottom of such plate, in a place and position to be clearly
23 visible, and must be maintained free from foreign materials and in a condition to be
24 clearly legible.
