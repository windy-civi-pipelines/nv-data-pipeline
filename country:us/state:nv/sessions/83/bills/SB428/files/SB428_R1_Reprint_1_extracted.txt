Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, for the purpose of determining a person’s eligibility
2 for public office, the residence of a person is the person’s actual residence within
3 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or other unit prescribed by law. (NRS
4 281.050) Section 1 of this bill provides that it is the public policy of this State to
5 ensure that a person continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
6 during the entire term of the office.
7 Existing law requires members of the Legislature and all public officers,
8 executive, judicial and ministerial, to take an oath of office before entering upon
9 their duties of office. (NRS 282.020) Section 2 of this bill requires all members of
10 the Legislature and public officers to swear additional oaths under penalty of
11 perjury, including that they will relinquish office under certain circumstances.

– 2 –
12 Sections 1.5 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to provide that public
13 officers must take and subscribe to more than one oath.
14 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a public office becomes vacant upon
15 certain events, including the ceasing of the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to
16 constructive, resident of the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed
17 by law in which the duties of the incumbent are to be exercised, or from which the
18 incumbent was elected or appointed, or in which the incumbent was required to reside
19 to be a candidate for office or appointed to office. If, upon the happening of such an
20 event, the incumbent fails or refuses to relinquish the office, existing law requires the
21 Attorney General or district attorney to commence and prosecute proceedings to
22 declare the office vacant. (NRS 283.040) Section 3 authorizes an elector with
23 knowledge or evidence of the happening of such an event to file with the Attorney
24 General or district attorney a challenge to the incumbent on the grounds that a
25 vacancy has occurred because the event has occurred.
26 Under existing law, if a vacancy occurs in a major or minor political party
27 nomination for a partisan office before a certain date in July of the year in which the
28 general election is held because the nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally
29 incompetent, the party central committee or executive committee may designate a
30 candidate to fill the nomination and the board of county commissioners in certain
31 legislative districts comprising more than one county may vote to appoint a candidate
32 to fill the vacancy and in all other cases, the nominee’s name must remain on the
33 ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists. (NRS 293.165, 293.166) Sections 4 and 5 of
34 this bill provide that if a vacancy occurs before a certain date in July in the year in
35 which the general election is held because the nominee no longer actually resides in
36 the State, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the nominee is
37 required to reside to be a candidate for office, the party central committee or executive
38 committee may designate a candidate to fill the vacancy and the board of county
39 commissioners in certain legislative districts comprising more than one county may
40 vote to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
41 Section 11 of this bill provides that if a vacancy in nomination occurs for a city
42 office after a certain date in July because the nominee no longer actually resides in
43 the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the
44 nominee is required to reside to be a candidate for office, the nominee’s name must
45 remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
46 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a name may not be printed on a
47 ballot for primary election unless the candidate, including a candidate appointed to
48 fill a vacancy in a nomination, has filed a declaration of candidacy which must be
49 accompanied by proof of identity and residency of the candidate. The filing officer
50 is required to retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency which, except for
51 certain confidential information, may not be withheld from the public. (NRS
52 293.177, 293C.185) Sections 6 and 9 of this bill provide that, except for certain
53 confidential information, such proof of identity and residency is a public record.
54 Existing law authorizes an elector to file with the filing officer for an office a
55 written challenge to a person on the grounds that the person fails to meet a
56 qualification for office. If probable cause exists to support the challenge, existing
57 law requires the Attorney General, district attorney or city attorney to petition a
58 court of competent jurisdiction regarding the issue. (NRS 293.182, 293C.186)
59 Sections 7 and 10 of this bill require the Attorney General or district attorney to
60 notify the elector who filed the challenge of the time and place of a hearing
61 scheduled on the challenge.
62 Existing law requires the Secretary of State and county clerk to forward to each
63 other a certified list containing the name and mailing address of each person for
64 whom candidacy papers have been filed. (NRS 293.187) Section 8 of this bill
65 requires the certified list to contain the residential address where the person actually
66 resides and the mailing address, if different than the residential address.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or
3 her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
4 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
5 prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
6 which residence is claimed by the person.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
8 person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
9 person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
10 without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
11 absence must not be considered in determining the question of
12 residence.
13 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
14 elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
15 county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
16 law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
17 opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
18 eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
19 appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
20 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
21 deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
22 purposes of this section if:
23 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
24 himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
25 person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
26 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
27 permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
28 legally domiciled; and
29 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
30 permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
31 legally domiciled.
32 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
33 293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
34 question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
35 judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
36 candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
37 to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
38 residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
39 presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
40 determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
41 judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
42 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
-
*SB428_R1*
– 4 –
1 to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
2 brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
3 pursuant to that section.
4 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
5 preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
6 that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
7 elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
8 required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
9 State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
10 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
11 place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
12 resides and is legally domiciled:
13 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
14 and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
15 resides in the area prescribed by law for the office and actually
16 continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
17 during the entire term of the office so the person has an actual
18 connection with the constituents who reside in the area and has
19 particular knowledge of their concerns.
20 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
21 legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
22 of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
23 permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
24 legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
25 up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
26 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
27 the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
28 the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
29 domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
30 change.
31 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
32 limitation:
33 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
34 and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
35 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
36 spouse or domestic partner, if any.
37 (3) The place where the person lives with the person’s
38 children, dependents or relatives, if any.
39 (4) The place where the person lives with any other
40 individual whose relationship with the person is substantially similar
41 to a relationship with a spouse, domestic partner, child, dependent or
42 relative.
43 (5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if
44 any, live.

1 (6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the
2 voter registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the
3 person.
4 (7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
5 driver’s license or identification card issued to the person by the
6 Department of Motor Vehicles, any passport or military
7 identification card issued to the person by the United States or any
8 other form of identification issued to the person by a governmental
9 agency.
10 (8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
11 registration for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the
12 Department of Motor Vehicles or any registration for another type
13 of vehicle or mode of transportation, including, without limitation,
14 any aircraft, vessels or watercraft, issued to the person by a
15 governmental agency.
16 (9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
17 applications for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate,
18 registration, permit or similar type of authorization issued to the
19 person by a governmental agency which has the authority to
20 regulate an occupation or profession.
21 (10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
22 any document which the person is authorized or required by law to
23 file or record with a governmental agency, including, without
24 limitation, any deed, declaration of homestead or other record of
25 real or personal property, any applications for services, privileges or
26 benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but excluding the
27 person’s declaration of candidacy.
28 (11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
29 any type of check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the
30 person by a governmental agency or by any type of company that
31 provides insurance, workers’ compensation, health care or medical
32 benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party administrator.
33 (12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
34 the person’s paycheck, paystub or employment records.
35 (13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
36 the person’s bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage
37 statements, loan statements, financial accounts, credit card accounts,
38 utility accounts or other billing statements or accounts.
39 (14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries
40 from the United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
41 (d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be
42 illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The
43 presence or absence of any particular type of evidence listed in
44 paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the person’s legal

41 the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to constructive, resident

28 office of State Senator, Assemblyman or Assemblywoman from a
29 legislative district comprising more than one county may be filled as

3 pay the reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the person who
4 was challenged.
5 Sec. 11. NRS 293C.190 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 293C.190 1. A vacancy occurring in a nomination for a city
7 office before 5 p.m. of the fourth Friday in July of the year in which
8 the general city election is held must be filled by the person who
9 received the next highest vote for the nomination in the primary city
10 election if a primary city election was held for that city office. If no
11 primary city election was held for that city office or if there was not
12 more than one person who was seeking the nomination in the
13 primary city election, a person may become a candidate for the city
14 office at the general city election if the person files a declaration of
15 candidacy with the appropriate filing officer and pays the filing fee
16 established by the governing body of the city before 5 p.m. on the
17 fourth Friday in July.
18 2. No change may be made on the ballot for the general city
19 election after 5 p.m. on the fourth Friday in July of the year in which
20 the general city election is held. If, after that time and date:
21 (a) A nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally
22 incompetent; [or]
23 (b) A nominee no longer actually, as opposed to constructively,
24 resides in the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit
25 prescribed by law in which the nominee is required to reside to be
26 a candidate for office, as determined pursuant to NRS 281.050,
27 283.040 or 293C.186, as applicable; or
28 (c) A vacancy in the nomination is otherwise created,
29  the nominee’s name must remain on the ballot for the general city
30 election and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
31 Sec. 11.5. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing the
32 Nevada Revised Statutes and Nevada Administrative Code,
33 substitute appropriately the term “oaths of office” for the term “oath
34 of office.”
35 Sec. 12. The provisions of NRS 282.010, 282.020 and
36 subsection 1 of NRS 283.040, as amended by sections 1.5, 2 and 3
37 of this act, respectively, requiring all public officers to take and
38 subscribe additional oaths of office and providing for a vacancy if a
39 public officer is convicted of violating an oath or refuses or neglects
40 to take an oath do not apply to any member of the Legislature or
41 executive, judicial, municipal or ministerial officer who holds office
42 on or before the effective date of this act.

FIRST REPRINT S.B. 428
SENATE BILL NO. 428–COMMITTEE ON
LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public office.
(BDR 23-955)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public office; revising provisions relating to the
eligibility of a public officer to remain in office; requiring
a public officer to take additional oaths of office;
authorizing an elector to file a challenge to the eligibility
of an incumbent of a public office; revising provisions
relating to vacancies in nomination for a public office;
providing that, with certain exceptions, the proof of
identity and residency provided with a declaration of
candidacy is a public record; revising provisions relating
to a challenge to the qualifications of a candidate for
public office; revising the information that must be
included on a certified list of candidates for public office;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, for the purpose of determining a person’s eligibility
2 for public office, the residence of a person is the person’s actual residence within
3 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or other unit prescribed by law. (NRS
4 281.050) Section 1 of this bill provides that it is the public policy of this State to
5 ensure that a person continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
6 during the entire term of the office.
7 Existing law requires members of the Legislature and all public officers,
8 executive, judicial and ministerial, to take an oath of office before entering upon
9 their duties of office. (NRS 282.020) Section 2 of this bill requires all members of
10 the Legislature and public officers to swear additional oaths under penalty of
11 perjury, including that they will relinquish office under certain circumstances.
-
*SB428_R1*

– 2 –
12 Sections 1.5 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to provide that public
13 officers must take and subscribe to more than one oath.
14 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a public office becomes vacant upon
15 certain events, including the ceasing of the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to
16 constructive, resident of the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed
17 by law in which the duties of the incumbent are to be exercised, or from which the
18 incumbent was elected or appointed, or in which the incumbent was required to reside
19 to be a candidate for office or appointed to office. If, upon the happening of such an
20 event, the incumbent fails or refuses to relinquish the office, existing law requires the
21 Attorney General or district attorney to commence and prosecute proceedings to
22 declare the office vacant. (NRS 283.040) Section 3 authorizes an elector with
23 knowledge or evidence of the happening of such an event to file with the Attorney
24 General or district attorney a challenge to the incumbent on the grounds that a
25 vacancy has occurred because the event has occurred.
26 Under existing law, if a vacancy occurs in a major or minor political party
27 nomination for a partisan office before a certain date in July of the year in which the
28 general election is held because the nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally
29 incompetent, the party central committee or executive committee may designate a
30 candidate to fill the nomination and the board of county commissioners in certain
31 legislative districts comprising more than one county may vote to appoint a candidate
32 to fill the vacancy and in all other cases, the nominee’s name must remain on the
33 ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists. (NRS 293.165, 293.166) Sections 4 and 5 of
34 this bill provide that if a vacancy occurs before a certain date in July in the year in
35 which the general election is held because the nominee no longer actually resides in
36 the State, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the nominee is
37 required to reside to be a candidate for office, the party central committee or executive
38 committee may designate a candidate to fill the vacancy and the board of county
39 commissioners in certain legislative districts comprising more than one county may
40 vote to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
41 Section 11 of this bill provides that if a vacancy in nomination occurs for a city
42 office after a certain date in July because the nominee no longer actually resides in
43 the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the
44 nominee is required to reside to be a candidate for office, the nominee’s name must
45 remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
46 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a name may not be printed on a
47 ballot for primary election unless the candidate, including a candidate appointed to
48 fill a vacancy in a nomination, has filed a declaration of candidacy which must be
49 accompanied by proof of identity and residency of the candidate. The filing officer
50 is required to retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency which, except for
51 certain confidential information, may not be withheld from the public. (NRS
52 293.177, 293C.185) Sections 6 and 9 of this bill provide that, except for certain
53 confidential information, such proof of identity and residency is a public record.
54 Existing law authorizes an elector to file with the filing officer for an office a
55 written challenge to a person on the grounds that the person fails to meet a
56 qualification for office. If probable cause exists to support the challenge, existing
57 law requires the Attorney General, district attorney or city attorney to petition a
58 court of competent jurisdiction regarding the issue. (NRS 293.182, 293C.186)
59 Sections 7 and 10 of this bill require the Attorney General or district attorney to
60 notify the elector who filed the challenge of the time and place of a hearing
61 scheduled on the challenge.
62 Existing law requires the Secretary of State and county clerk to forward to each
63 other a certified list containing the name and mailing address of each person for
64 whom candidacy papers have been filed. (NRS 293.187) Section 8 of this bill
65 requires the certified list to contain the residential address where the person actually
66 resides and the mailing address, if different than the residential address.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or
3 her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
4 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
5 prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
6 which residence is claimed by the person.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
8 person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
9 person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
10 without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
11 absence must not be considered in determining the question of
12 residence.
13 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
14 elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
15 county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
16 law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
17 opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
18 eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
19 appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
20 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
21 deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
22 purposes of this section if:
23 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
24 himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
25 person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
26 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
27 permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
28 legally domiciled; and
29 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
30 permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
31 legally domiciled.
32 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
33 293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
34 question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
35 judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
36 candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
37 to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
38 residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
39 presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
40 determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
41 judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
42 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
-
*SB428_R1*

– 4 –
1 to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
2 brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
3 pursuant to that section.
4 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
5 preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
6 that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
7 elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
8 required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
9 State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
10 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
11 place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
12 resides and is legally domiciled:
13 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
14 and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
15 resides in the area prescribed by law for the office and actually
16 continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
17 during the entire term of the office so the person has an actual
18 connection with the constituents who reside in the area and has
19 particular knowledge of their concerns.
20 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
21 legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
22 of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
23 permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
24 legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
25 up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
26 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
27 the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
28 the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
29 domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
30 change.
31 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
32 limitation:
33 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
34 and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
35 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
36 spouse or domestic partner, if any.
37 (3) The place where the person lives with the person’s
38 children, dependents or relatives, if any.
39 (4) The place where the person lives with any other
40 individual whose relationship with the person is substantially similar
41 to a relationship with a spouse, domestic partner, child, dependent or
42 relative.
43 (5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if
44 any, live.
-
*SB428_R1*

– 5 –
1 (6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the
2 voter registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the
3 person.
4 (7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
5 driver’s license or identification card issued to the person by the
6 Department of Motor Vehicles, any passport or military
7 identification card issued to the person by the United States or any
8 other form of identification issued to the person by a governmental
9 agency.
10 (8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
11 registration for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the
12 Department of Motor Vehicles or any registration for another type
13 of vehicle or mode of transportation, including, without limitation,
14 any aircraft, vessels or watercraft, issued to the person by a
15 governmental agency.
16 (9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
17 applications for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate,
18 registration, permit or similar type of authorization issued to the
19 person by a governmental agency which has the authority to
20 regulate an occupation or profession.
21 (10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
22 any document which the person is authorized or required by law to
23 file or record with a governmental agency, including, without
24 limitation, any deed, declaration of homestead or other record of
25 real or personal property, any applications for services, privileges or
26 benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but excluding the
27 person’s declaration of candidacy.
28 (11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
29 any type of check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the
30 person by a governmental agency or by any type of company that
31 provides insurance, workers’ compensation, health care or medical
32 benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party administrator.
33 (12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
34 the person’s paycheck, paystub or employment records.
35 (13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
36 the person’s bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage
37 statements, loan statements, financial accounts, credit card accounts,
38 utility accounts or other billing statements or accounts.
39 (14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries
40 from the United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
41 (d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be
42 illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The
43 presence or absence of any particular type of evidence listed in
44 paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the person’s legal

1 domicile, but such a determination must be based upon all the facts
2 and circumstances of the person’s particular case.
3 8. As used in this section:
4 (a) “Actual residence” means the place of permanent habitation
5 where a person actually resides and is legally domiciled. If the
6 person maintains more than one place of permanent habitation, the
7 place the person declares to be the person’s principal permanent
8 habitation when filing a declaration of candidacy for any elective
9 office must be the place where the person actually resides and is
10 legally domiciled in order for the person to be eligible to the office.
11 (b) “Declaration of candidacy” has the meaning ascribed to it in
12 NRS 293.0455.
13 Sec. 1.5. NRS 282.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 282.010 1. Members of the Legislature and all officers,
15 executive, judicial and ministerial, shall, before entering upon the
16 duties of their respective offices, provide the official bond required
17 by law, when such bond shall be required, and take and subscribe to
18 the official [oath.] oaths.
19 2. All officers elected, except Senators and members of the
20 Assembly, shall qualify, and execute and deliver their official bonds
21 when required, as provided in this section, prior to the Tuesday after
22 the first Monday in January ensuing their election.
23 3. All officers appointed to fill vacancies, in the cases provided
24 by law, shall qualify and give bond when required, within 30 days
25 from the time of their appointment.
26 4. The term of office of all officers, elected or appointed, shall
27 begin from the time of their qualification, unless some other express
28 provision is made by law.
29 Sec. 2. NRS 282.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 282.020 1. Members of the Legislature and all officers,
31 executive, judicial , municipal and ministerial, shall, before they
32 enter upon the duties of their respective offices, take and subscribe
33 to the following constitutional oath:
34

33 county, upon his or her own recognizance or a determination that

21 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
22 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;

43 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
44 the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at
45 that address, service must be made by personally delivering to and
-

– 16 –
1 leaving with the filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The
2 filing officer shall immediately send, by registered or certified mail,

5 address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail
6 the copy to the last address so designated.

19 challenge of a candidate pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 of NRS
20 293.182 to which the provisions of NRS 293.2045 apply.
21 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration
22 of candidacy which contains a false statement in violation of this
23 section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
24 Sec. 7. NRS 293.182 is hereby amended to read as follows:

29 written challenge of the person on the grounds that the person fails
30 to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
31 Constitution or laws of this State. Before accepting the challenge
32 from the elector, the filing officer shall notify the elector that if the

4 probable cause exists to support the challenge, the Attorney General
5 or district attorney shall, not later than 5 working days after
6 receiving the challenge, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
7 order the person to appear before the court. Upon receipt of such a
8 petition, the court shall enter an order directing the person to appear
9 before the court at a hearing, at a time and place to be fixed by the
10 court in the order, to show cause why the challenge is not valid. A
11 certified copy of the order must be served upon the person. The
12 Attorney General or district attorney shall notify the elector who
13 filed the challenge of the time and place of the hearing. The court
14 shall give priority to such proceedings over all other matters
15 pending with the court, except for criminal proceedings.

22 For the purpose of having my name placed on the official

21 3. The address of a candidate that must be included in the
22 declaration of candidacy pursuant to subsection 2 must be the street
23 address of the residence where the candidate actually, as opposed to
24 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050, if one has
25 been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
26 for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
27 provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of
28 subsection 4:
29 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post
30 office box unless a street address has not been assigned to the
31 residence; and
32 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the candidate
33 shall present to the filing officer:
34 (1) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
35 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate
36 and the candidate’s residential address; or
37 (2) A current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or
38 document issued by a governmental entity, including a check which
39 indicates the candidate’s name and residential address, but not
40 including a voter registration card.
41 4. If the candidate executes an oath or affirmation under
42 penalty of perjury stating that the candidate is unable to present to
43 the filing officer the proof of residency required by subsection 3
44 because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s
45 residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
-
*SB428_R1*

– 20 –
1 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency
2 required by subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing
3 officer:
4 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
5 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;
6 and
7 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that
8 the filing officer determines is sufficient to verify where the
9 candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in
10 accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State may adopt
11 regulations establishing the forms of alternative proof of the
12 candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to
13 verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively,
14 resides in accordance with NRS 281.050.
15 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity
16 and residency provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or
17 4. Such a copy:
18 (a) [May] Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), is a
19 public record and may not be withheld from the public; and
20 (b) Must not contain the social security number, driver’s license
21 or identification card number or account number of the candidate.
22 6. By filing the declaration of candidacy, the candidate shall be
23 deemed to have appointed the city clerk as his or her agent for
24 service of process for the purposes of a proceeding pursuant to NRS
25 293C.186. Service of such process must first be attempted at the
26 appropriate address as specified by the candidate in the declaration
27 of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at that address,
28 service must be made by personally delivering to and leaving with
29 the city clerk duplicate copies of the process. The city clerk shall
30 immediately send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies
31 to the candidate at the specified address, unless the candidate has
32 designated in writing to the city clerk a different address for that
33 purpose, in which case the city clerk shall mail the copy to the last
34 address so designated.
35 7. If the city clerk receives credible evidence indicating that a
36 candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
37 civil rights restored, the city clerk:
38 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the
39 candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
40 candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and
41 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from
42 such investigation to the city attorney.
43 8. The receipt of information by the city attorney pursuant to
44 subsection 7 must be treated as a challenge of a candidate pursuant
-
*SB428_R1*

– 21 –
1 to subsections 4 and 5 of NRS 293C.186 to which the provisions of
2 NRS 293.2045 apply.
3 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration
4 of candidacy which contains a false statement in violation of this
5 section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
6 Sec. 10. NRS 293C.186 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 293C.186 1. After a person files a declaration of candidacy to
8 be a candidate for an office, and not later than 5 days after the last
9 day the person may withdraw his or her candidacy pursuant to NRS
10 293C.195, an elector may file with the city clerk a written challenge
11 of the person on the grounds that the person fails to meet any
12 qualification required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or
13 laws of this State. Before accepting the challenge from the elector,
14 the filing officer shall notify the elector that if the challenge is found
15 by a court to be frivolous, the elector may be required to pay the
16 reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the person who is being
17 challenged.
18 2. A challenge filed pursuant to subsection 1 must:
19 (a) Indicate each qualification the person fails to meet;
20 (b) Have attached all documentation and evidence supporting
21 the challenge; and
22 (c) Be in the form of an affidavit, signed by the elector under
23 penalty of perjury.
24 3. Upon receipt of a challenge pursuant to subsection 1, the
25 city clerk shall immediately transmit the challenge to the city
26 attorney.
27 4. If the city attorney determines that probable cause exists to
28 support the challenge, the city attorney shall, not later than 5
29 working days after receiving the challenge, petition a court of
30 competent jurisdiction to order the person to appear before the court.
31 Upon receipt of such a petition, the court shall enter an order
32 directing the person to appear before the court at a hearing, at a time
33 and place to be fixed by the court in the order, to show cause why
34 the challenge is not valid. A certified copy of the order must be
35 served upon the person. The city attorney shall notify the elector
36 who filed the challenge of the time and place of the hearing. The
37 court shall give priority to such proceedings over all other matters
38 pending with the court, except for criminal proceedings.
39 5. If, at the hearing, the court determines by a preponderance of
40 the evidence that the challenge is valid or that the person otherwise
41 fails to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
42 Constitution or laws of this State, or if the person fails to appear at
43 the hearing, the person is subject to the provisions of
44 NRS 293.2045.

11 primary city election was held for that city office or if there was not
12 more than one person who was seeking the nomination in the
13 primary city election, a person may become a candidate for the city
14 office at the general city election if the person files a declaration of
15 candidacy with the appropriate filing officer and pays the filing fee
16 established by the governing body of the city before 5 p.m. on the
17 fourth Friday in July.
18 2. No change may be made on the ballot for the general city
19 election after 5 p.m. on the fourth Friday in July of the year in which
20 the general city election is held. If, after that time and date:
21 (a) A nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally

27 283.040 or 293C.186, as applicable; or
28 (c) A vacancy in the nomination is otherwise created,

30 election and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
31 Sec. 11.5. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing the
