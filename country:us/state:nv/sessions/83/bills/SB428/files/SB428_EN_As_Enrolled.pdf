Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that, for the purpose of determining a person’s eligibility
for public office, the residence of a person is the person’s actual residence within
the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or other unit prescribed by law. (NRS
281.050) Section 1 of this bill provides that it is the public policy of this State to
ensure that a person continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
during the entire term of the office.
Existing law requires members of the Legislature and all public officers,
executive, judicial and ministerial, to take an oath of office before entering upon
their duties of office. (NRS 282.020) Section 2 of this bill requires all members of
the Legislature and public officers to swear additional oaths under penalty of
perjury, including that they will relinquish office under certain circumstances.
Sections 1.5 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes to provide that public
officers must take and subscribe to more than one oath.
Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a public office becomes vacant
upon certain events, including the ceasing of the incumbent to be an actual, as
opposed to constructive, resident of the State, district, county, city, ward or other
unit prescribed by law in which the duties of the incumbent are to be exercised, or
from which the incumbent was elected or appointed, or in which the incumbent was
required to reside to be a candidate for office or appointed to office. If, upon the
happening of such an event, the incumbent fails or refuses to relinquish the office,
existing law requires the Attorney General or district attorney to commence and
prosecute proceedings to declare the office vacant. (NRS 283.040) Section 3
authorizes an elector with knowledge or evidence of the happening of such an event
to file with the Attorney General or district attorney a challenge to the incumbent
on the grounds that a vacancy has occurred because the event has occurred.
Under existing law, if a vacancy occurs in a major or minor political party
nomination for a partisan office before a certain date in July of the year in which
the general election is held because the nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or
mentally incompetent, the party central committee or executive committee may
designate a candidate to fill the nomination and the board of county commissioners
in certain legislative districts comprising more than one county may vote to appoint
-

– 2 –
a candidate to fill the vacancy and in all other cases, the nominee’s name must
remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists. (NRS 293.165, 293.166)
Sections 4 and 5 of this bill provide that if a vacancy occurs before a certain date in
July in the year in which the general election is held because the nominee no longer
actually resides in the State, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in
which the nominee is required to reside to be a candidate for office, the party
central committee or executive committee may designate a candidate to fill the
vacancy and the board of county commissioners in certain legislative districts
comprising more than one county may vote to appoint a candidate to fill the
vacancy.
Section 11 of this bill provides that if a vacancy in nomination occurs for a city
office after a certain date in July because the nominee no longer actually resides in
the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the
nominee is required to reside to be a candidate for office, the nominee’s name must
remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a name may not be printed on a
ballot for primary election unless the candidate, including a candidate appointed to
fill a vacancy in a nomination, has filed a declaration of candidacy which must be
accompanied by proof of identity and residency of the candidate. The filing officer
is required to retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency which, except for
certain confidential information, may not be withheld from the public. (NRS
293.177, 293C.185) Sections 6 and 9 of this bill provide that, except for certain
confidential information, such proof of identity and residency is a public record.
Existing law authorizes an elector to file with the filing officer for an office a
written challenge to a person on the grounds that the person fails to meet a
qualification for office. If probable cause exists to support the challenge, existing
law requires the Attorney General, district attorney or city attorney to petition a
court of competent jurisdiction regarding the issue. (NRS 293.182, 293C.186)
Sections 7 and 10 of this bill require the Attorney General or district attorney or
city attorney to notify the elector who filed the challenge of the time and place of a
hearing scheduled on the challenge.
Existing law requires the Secretary of State and county clerk to forward to each
other a certified list containing the name and mailing address of each person for
whom candidacy papers have been filed. (NRS 293.187) Section 8 of this bill
requires the certified list to contain the residential address where the person actually
resides and the mailing address, if different than the residential address.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or
her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
which residence is claimed by the person.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
absence must not be considered in determining the question of
residence.
3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
purposes of this section if:
(a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
(b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
legally domiciled; and
(c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
legally domiciled.
5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
pursuant to that section.
6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.

83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
resides and is legally domiciled:
(a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
resides in the area prescribed by law for the office and actually
continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
during the entire term of the office so the person has an actual
connection with the constituents who reside in the area and has
particular knowledge of their concerns.
(b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
change.
(c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
limitation:
(1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
(2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
spouse or domestic partner, if any.
(3) The place where the person lives with the person’s
children, dependents or relatives, if any.
(4) The place where the person lives with any other
individual whose relationship with the person is substantially similar
to a relationship with a spouse, domestic partner, child, dependent or
relative.
(5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if
any, live.
(6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the
voter registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the
person.
(7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
driver’s license or identification card issued to the person by the
Department of Motor Vehicles, any passport or military
identification card issued to the person by the United States or any
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
other form of identification issued to the person by a governmental
agency.
(8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
registration for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the
Department of Motor Vehicles or any registration for another type
of vehicle or mode of transportation, including, without limitation,
any aircraft, vessels or watercraft, issued to the person by a
governmental agency.
(9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
applications for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate,
registration, permit or similar type of authorization issued to the
person by a governmental agency which has the authority to
regulate an occupation or profession.
(10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
any document which the person is authorized or required by law to
file or record with a governmental agency, including, without
limitation, any deed, declaration of homestead or other record of
real or personal property, any applications for services, privileges or
benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but excluding the
person’s declaration of candidacy.
(11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
any type of check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the
person by a governmental agency or by any type of company that
provides insurance, workers’ compensation, health care or medical
benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party administrator.
(12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
the person’s paycheck, paystub or employment records.
(13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
the person’s bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage
statements, loan statements, financial accounts, credit card accounts,
utility accounts or other billing statements or accounts.
(14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries
from the United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
(d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be
illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The
presence or absence of any particular type of evidence listed in
paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the person’s legal
domicile, but such a determination must be based upon all the facts
and circumstances of the person’s particular case.

(a) “Actual residence” means the place of permanent habitation

3. The address of a candidate which must be included in the
declaration of candidacy pursuant to subsection 2 must be the street
address of the residence where the candidate actually, as opposed to
constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050, if one has
been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of
subsection 4:
(a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post
office box unless a street address has not been assigned to his or her
residence; and
(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the candidate
shall present to the filing officer:
(1) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate
and the candidate’s residential address; or
(2) A current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or
document issued by a governmental entity, including a check which
indicates the candidate’s name and residential address, but not
including a voter registration card.
4. If the candidate executes an oath or affirmation under
penalty of perjury stating that the candidate is unable to present to
the filing officer the proof of residency required by subsection 3
because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s
residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency
required by subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing
officer:
(a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;
and
(b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that
the filing officer determines is sufficient to verify where the
candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in
accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State may adopt
regulations establishing the forms of alternative proof of the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 16 –
candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to
verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively,
resides in accordance with NRS 281.050.
5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity
and residency provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or

public record and may not be withheld from the public; and
(b) Must not contain the social security number, driver’s license
or identification card number or account number of the candidate.
6. By filing the declaration of candidacy, the candidate shall be
deemed to have appointed the filing officer for the office as his or
her agent for service of process for the purposes of a proceeding
pursuant to NRS 293.182. Service of such process must first be
attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at
that address, service must be made by personally delivering to and
leaving with the filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The
filing officer shall immediately send, by registered or certified mail,
one of the copies to the candidate at the specified address, unless the
candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer a different
address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail
the copy to the last address so designated.
7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that
a candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
civil rights restored, the filing officer:
(a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the
candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and
(b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from
such investigation to the Attorney General, if the filing officer is the
Secretary of State, or to the district attorney, if the filing officer is a
person other than the Secretary of State.
8. The receipt of information by the Attorney General or
district attorney pursuant to subsection 7 must be treated as a
challenge of a candidate pursuant to subsections 4 and 5 of NRS
293.182 to which the provisions of NRS 293.2045 apply.
9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration
of candidacy which contains a false statement in violation of this
section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
Sec. 7. NRS 293.182 is hereby amended to read as follows:
293.182 1. After a person files a declaration of candidacy to
be a candidate for an office, and not later than 5 days after the last
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 17 –
day the person may withdraw his or her candidacy pursuant to NRS
293.202, an elector may file with the filing officer for the office a
written challenge of the person on the grounds that the person fails
to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
Constitution or laws of this State. Before accepting the challenge
from the elector, the filing officer shall notify the elector that if the
challenge is found by a court to be frivolous, the elector may be
required to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the
person who is being challenged.
2. A challenge filed pursuant to subsection 1 must:
(a) Indicate each qualification the person fails to meet;
(b) Have attached all documentation and evidence supporting
the challenge; and
(c) Be in the form of an affidavit, signed by the elector under
penalty of perjury.
3. Upon receipt of a challenge pursuant to subsection 1:
(a) The Secretary of State shall immediately transmit the
challenge to the Attorney General.
(b) A filing officer other than the Secretary of State shall
immediately transmit the challenge to the district attorney.
4. If the Attorney General or district attorney determines that
probable cause exists to support the challenge, the Attorney General
or district attorney shall, not later than 5 working days after
receiving the challenge, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
order the person to appear before the court. Upon receipt of such a
petition, the court shall enter an order directing the person to appear
before the court at a hearing, at a time and place to be fixed by the
court in the order, to show cause why the challenge is not valid. A
certified copy of the order must be served upon the person. The
Attorney General or district attorney shall notify the elector who
filed the challenge of the time and place of the hearing. The court
shall give priority to such proceedings over all other matters
pending with the court, except for criminal proceedings.
5. If, at the hearing, the court determines by a preponderance of
the evidence that the challenge is valid or that the person otherwise
fails to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
Constitution or laws of this State, or if the person fails to appear at
the hearing, the person is subject to the provisions of
NRS 293.2045.
6. If, at the hearing, the court determines that the challenge is
frivolous, the court may order the elector who filed the challenge to
pay the reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the person who
was challenged.
