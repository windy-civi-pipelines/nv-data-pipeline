Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, for the purpose of determining a person’s eligibility
2 for public office, the residence of a person is the person’s actual residence within
3 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or other unit prescribed by law. (NRS
4 281.050) Section 1 of this bill provides that it is the public policy of this State to
5 ensure that a person continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
6 during the entire term of the office.
7 Existing law requires members of the Legislature and all public officers,
8 executive, judicial and ministerial, to take an oath of office before entering upon
9 their duties of office. (NRS 282.020) Section 2 of this bill requires all members of
10 the Legislature and public officers to swear additional oaths under penalty of
11 perjury, including that they will relinquish office under certain circumstances.

12 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a public office becomes vacant upon
13 certain events, including the ceasing of the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to
14 constructive, resident of the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed
15 by law in which the duties of the incumbent are to be exercised, or from which the
16 incumbent was elected or appointed, or in which the incumbent was required to reside
17 to be a candidate for office or appointed to office. If, upon the happening of such an
18 event, the incumbent fails or refuses to relinquish the office, existing law requires the
19 Attorney General or district attorney to commence and prosecute proceedings to
20 declare the office vacant. (NRS 283.040) Section 3 of this bill authorizes an elector
21 with knowledge or evidence of the happening of such an event to file with the
22 Attorney General or district attorney a challenge to the incumbent on the grounds that
23 a vacancy has occurred because the event has occurred.
24 Under existing law, if a vacancy occurs in a major or minor political party
25 nomination for a partisan office before a certain date in July of the year in which the
26 general election is held because the nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally
27 incompetent, the party central committee or executive committee may designate a
28 candidate to fill the nomination and the board of county commissioners in certain
29 legislative districts comprising more than one county may vote to appoint a candidate
30 to fill the vacancy and in all other cases, the nominee’s name must remain on the
31 ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists. (NRS 293.165, 293.166) Sections 4 and 5 of
32 this bill provide that if a vacancy occurs before a certain date in July in the year in
33 which the general election is held because the nominee no longer actually resides in
34 the State, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the nominee is
35 required to reside to be a candidate for office, the party central committee or executive
36 committee may designate a candidate to fill the vacancy and the board of county
37 commissioners in certain legislative districts comprising more than one county may
38 vote to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
39 Section 11 of this bill provides that if a vacancy in nomination occurs for a city
40 office after a certain date in July because the nominee no longer actually resides in
41 the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the
42 nominee is required to reside to be a candidate for office, the nominee’s name must
43 remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
44 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a name may not be printed on a
45 ballot for primary election unless the candidate, including a candidate appointed to
46 fill a vacancy in a nomination, has filed a declaration of candidacy which must be
47 accompanied by proof of identity and residency of the candidate. The filing officer
48 is required to retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency which, except for
49 certain confidential information, may not be withheld from the public. (NRS
50 293.177, 293C.185) Sections 6 and 9 of this bill provide that, except for certain
51 confidential information, such proof of identity and residency is a public record.
52 Existing law authorizes an elector to file with the filing officer for an office a
53 written challenge to a person on the grounds that the person fails to meet a
54 qualification for office. If probable cause exists to support the challenge, existing
55 law requires the Attorney General, district attorney or city attorney to petition a
56 court of competent jurisdiction regarding the issue. (NRS 293.182, 293C.186)
57 Sections 7 and 10 of this bill require the Attorney General or district attorney to
58 notify the elector who filed the challenge of the time and place of a hearing
59 scheduled on the challenge.
60 Existing law requires the Secretary of State and county clerk to forward to each
61 other a certified list containing the name and mailing address of each person for
62 whom candidacy papers have been filed. (NRS 293.187) Section 8 of this bill
63 requires the certified list to contain the residential address where the person actually
64 resides and the mailing address, if different than the residential address.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or
3 her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
4 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
5 prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
6 which residence is claimed by the person.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
8 person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
9 person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
10 without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
11 absence must not be considered in determining the question of
12 residence.
13 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
14 elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
15 county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
16 law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
17 opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
18 eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
19 appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
20 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
21 deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
22 purposes of this section if:
23 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
24 himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
25 person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
26 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
27 permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
28 legally domiciled; and
29 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
30 permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
31 legally domiciled.
32 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
33 293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
34 question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
35 judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
36 candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
37 to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
38 residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
39 presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
40 determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
41 judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
42 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
-
*SB428*
– 4 –
1 to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
2 brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
3 pursuant to that section.
4 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
5 preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
6 that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
7 elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
8 required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
9 State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
10 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
11 place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
12 resides and is legally domiciled:
13 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
14 and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
15 resides in the area prescribed by law for the office and actually
16 continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
17 during the entire term of the office so the person has an actual
18 connection with the constituents who reside in the area and has
19 particular knowledge of their concerns.
20 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
21 legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
22 of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
23 permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
24 legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
25 up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
26 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
27 the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
28 the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
29 domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
30 change.
31 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
32 limitation:
33 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
34 and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
35 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
36 spouse or domestic partner, if any.
37 (3) The place where the person lives with the person’s
38 children, dependents or relatives, if any.
39 (4) The place where the person lives with any other
40 individual whose relationship with the person is substantially similar
41 to a relationship with a spouse, domestic partner, child, dependent or
42 relative.
43 (5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if
44 any, live.
-

– 5 –
1 (6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the
2 voter registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the
3 person.
4 (7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
5 driver’s license or identification card issued to the person by the
6 Department of Motor Vehicles, any passport or military
7 identification card issued to the person by the United States or any
8 other form of identification issued to the person by a governmental
9 agency.
10 (8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
11 registration for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the
12 Department of Motor Vehicles or any registration for another type
13 of vehicle or mode of transportation, including, without limitation,
14 any aircraft, vessels or watercraft, issued to the person by a
15 governmental agency.
16 (9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
17 applications for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate,
18 registration, permit or similar type of authorization issued to the
19 person by a governmental agency which has the authority to
20 regulate an occupation or profession.
21 (10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
22 any document which the person is authorized or required by law to
23 file or record with a governmental agency, including, without
24 limitation, any deed, declaration of homestead or other record of
25 real or personal property, any applications for services, privileges or
26 benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but excluding the
27 person’s declaration of candidacy.
28 (11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
29 any type of check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the
30 person by a governmental agency or by any type of company that
31 provides insurance, workers’ compensation, health care or medical
32 benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party administrator.
33 (12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
34 the person’s paycheck, paystub or employment records.
35 (13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
36 the person’s bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage
37 statements, loan statements, financial accounts, credit card accounts,
38 utility accounts or other billing statements or accounts.
39 (14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries
40 from the United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
41 (d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be
42 illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The
43 presence or absence of any particular type of evidence listed in
44 paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the person’s legal
-

1 domicile, but such a determination must be based upon all the facts
2 and circumstances of the person’s particular case.
3 8. As used in this section:
4 (a) “Actual residence” means the place of permanent habitation
5 where a person actually resides and is legally domiciled. If the
6 person maintains more than one place of permanent habitation, the
7 place the person declares to be the person’s principal permanent
8 habitation when filing a declaration of candidacy for any elective
9 office must be the place where the person actually resides and is
10 legally domiciled in order for the person to be eligible to the office.
11 (b) “Declaration of candidacy” has the meaning ascribed to it in
12 NRS 293.0455.

25 expel or remove from office the Governor, other state and judicial
26 officers or State Legislators.

5 been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
6 for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
7 provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of
8 subsection 4:
9 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post

21 4. If the candidate executes an oath or affirmation under
22 penalty of perjury stating that the candidate is unable to present to
23 the filing officer the proof of residency required by subsection 3
24 because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s
25 residence or because the rural or remote location of the candidate’s
26 residence makes it impracticable to present the proof of residency
27 required by subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing
28 officer:
29 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
30 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;
31 and
32 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that
33 the filing officer determines is sufficient to verify where the

40 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity
41 and residency provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or

6 pursuant to NRS 293.182. Service of such process must first be
7 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
8 the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at
9 that address, service must be made by personally delivering to and
10 leaving with the filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The
11 filing officer shall immediately send, by registered or certified mail,
12 one of the copies to the candidate at the specified address, unless the
13 candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer a different
14 address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail
15 the copy to the last address so designated.
16 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that
17 a candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her

30 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration

38 written challenge of the person on the grounds that the person fails
39 to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
40 Constitution or laws of this State. Before accepting the challenge
41 from the elector, the filing officer shall notify the elector that if the
42 challenge is found by a court to be frivolous, the elector may be
43 required to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the
44 person who is being challenged.

12 probable cause exists to support the challenge, the Attorney General
13 or district attorney shall, not later than 5 working days after
14 receiving the challenge, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
15 order the person to appear before the court. Upon receipt of such a
16 petition, the court shall enter an order directing the person to appear
17 before the court at a hearing, at a time and place to be fixed by the
18 court in the order, to show cause why the challenge is not valid. A
19 certified copy of the order must be served upon the person. The
20 Attorney General or district attorney shall notify the elector who
21 filed the challenge of the time and place of the hearing. The court
22 shall give priority to such proceedings over all other matters
23 pending with the court, except for criminal proceedings.

25 the evidence that the challenge is valid or that the person otherwise
26 fails to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
27 Constitution or laws of this State, or if the person fails to appear at
28 the hearing, the person is subject to the provisions of
29 NRS 293.2045.
30 6. If, at the hearing, the court determines that the challenge is
31 frivolous, the court may order the elector who filed the challenge to

LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public office.
(BDR 23-955)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public office; revising provisions relating to the
eligibility of a public officer to remain in office; revising
the oath of office for a public officer; authorizing an
elector to file a challenge to the eligibility of an
incumbent of a public office; revising provisions relating
to vacancies in nomination for a public office; providing
that, with certain exceptions, the proof of identity and
residency provided with a declaration of candidacy is a
public record; revising provisions relating to a challenge
to the qualifications of a candidate for public office;
revising the information that must be included on a
certified list of candidates for public office; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, for the purpose of determining a person’s eligibility
2 for public office, the residence of a person is the person’s actual residence within
3 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or other unit prescribed by law. (NRS
4 281.050) Section 1 of this bill provides that it is the public policy of this State to
5 ensure that a person continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
6 during the entire term of the office.
7 Existing law requires members of the Legislature and all public officers,
8 executive, judicial and ministerial, to take an oath of office before entering upon
9 their duties of office. (NRS 282.020) Section 2 of this bill requires all members of
10 the Legislature and public officers to swear additional oaths under penalty of
11 perjury, including that they will relinquish office under certain circumstances.

*SB428*

– 2 –
12 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a public office becomes vacant upon
13 certain events, including the ceasing of the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to
14 constructive, resident of the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed
15 by law in which the duties of the incumbent are to be exercised, or from which the
16 incumbent was elected or appointed, or in which the incumbent was required to reside
17 to be a candidate for office or appointed to office. If, upon the happening of such an
18 event, the incumbent fails or refuses to relinquish the office, existing law requires the
19 Attorney General or district attorney to commence and prosecute proceedings to
20 declare the office vacant. (NRS 283.040) Section 3 of this bill authorizes an elector
21 with knowledge or evidence of the happening of such an event to file with the
22 Attorney General or district attorney a challenge to the incumbent on the grounds that
23 a vacancy has occurred because the event has occurred.
24 Under existing law, if a vacancy occurs in a major or minor political party
25 nomination for a partisan office before a certain date in July of the year in which the
26 general election is held because the nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally
27 incompetent, the party central committee or executive committee may designate a
28 candidate to fill the nomination and the board of county commissioners in certain
29 legislative districts comprising more than one county may vote to appoint a candidate
30 to fill the vacancy and in all other cases, the nominee’s name must remain on the
31 ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists. (NRS 293.165, 293.166) Sections 4 and 5 of
32 this bill provide that if a vacancy occurs before a certain date in July in the year in
33 which the general election is held because the nominee no longer actually resides in
34 the State, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the nominee is
35 required to reside to be a candidate for office, the party central committee or executive
36 committee may designate a candidate to fill the vacancy and the board of county
37 commissioners in certain legislative districts comprising more than one county may
38 vote to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
39 Section 11 of this bill provides that if a vacancy in nomination occurs for a city
40 office after a certain date in July because the nominee no longer actually resides in
41 the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the
42 nominee is required to reside to be a candidate for office, the nominee’s name must
43 remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
44 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a name may not be printed on a
45 ballot for primary election unless the candidate, including a candidate appointed to
46 fill a vacancy in a nomination, has filed a declaration of candidacy which must be
47 accompanied by proof of identity and residency of the candidate. The filing officer
48 is required to retain a copy of the proof of identity and residency which, except for
49 certain confidential information, may not be withheld from the public. (NRS
50 293.177, 293C.185) Sections 6 and 9 of this bill provide that, except for certain
51 confidential information, such proof of identity and residency is a public record.
52 Existing law authorizes an elector to file with the filing officer for an office a
53 written challenge to a person on the grounds that the person fails to meet a
54 qualification for office. If probable cause exists to support the challenge, existing
55 law requires the Attorney General, district attorney or city attorney to petition a
56 court of competent jurisdiction regarding the issue. (NRS 293.182, 293C.186)
57 Sections 7 and 10 of this bill require the Attorney General or district attorney to
58 notify the elector who filed the challenge of the time and place of a hearing
59 scheduled on the challenge.
60 Existing law requires the Secretary of State and county clerk to forward to each
61 other a certified list containing the name and mailing address of each person for
62 whom candidacy papers have been filed. (NRS 293.187) Section 8 of this bill
63 requires the certified list to contain the residential address where the person actually
64 resides and the mailing address, if different than the residential address.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or
3 her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
4 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
5 prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
6 which residence is claimed by the person.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
8 person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
9 person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
10 without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
11 absence must not be considered in determining the question of
12 residence.
13 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
14 elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
15 county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
16 law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
17 opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
18 eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
19 appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
20 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
21 deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
22 purposes of this section if:
23 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
24 himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
25 person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
26 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
27 permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
28 legally domiciled; and
29 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
30 permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
31 legally domiciled.
32 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
33 293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
34 question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
35 judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
36 candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
37 to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
38 residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
39 presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
40 determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
41 judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
42 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
-
*SB428*

– 4 –
1 to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
2 brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
3 pursuant to that section.
4 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
5 preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
6 that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
7 elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
8 required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
9 State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
10 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
11 place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
12 resides and is legally domiciled:
13 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
14 and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
15 resides in the area prescribed by law for the office and actually
16 continues to reside in the area prescribed by law for the office
17 during the entire term of the office so the person has an actual
18 connection with the constituents who reside in the area and has
19 particular knowledge of their concerns.
20 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
21 legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
22 of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
23 permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
24 legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
25 up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
26 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
27 the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
28 the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
29 domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
30 change.
31 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
32 limitation:
33 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
34 and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
35 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
36 spouse or domestic partner, if any.
37 (3) The place where the person lives with the person’s
38 children, dependents or relatives, if any.
39 (4) The place where the person lives with any other
40 individual whose relationship with the person is substantially similar
41 to a relationship with a spouse, domestic partner, child, dependent or
42 relative.
43 (5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if
44 any, live.
-
*SB428*

– 5 –
1 (6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the
2 voter registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the
3 person.
4 (7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
5 driver’s license or identification card issued to the person by the
6 Department of Motor Vehicles, any passport or military
7 identification card issued to the person by the United States or any
8 other form of identification issued to the person by a governmental
9 agency.
10 (8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
11 registration for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the
12 Department of Motor Vehicles or any registration for another type
13 of vehicle or mode of transportation, including, without limitation,
14 any aircraft, vessels or watercraft, issued to the person by a
15 governmental agency.
16 (9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
17 applications for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate,
18 registration, permit or similar type of authorization issued to the
19 person by a governmental agency which has the authority to
20 regulate an occupation or profession.
21 (10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
22 any document which the person is authorized or required by law to
23 file or record with a governmental agency, including, without
24 limitation, any deed, declaration of homestead or other record of
25 real or personal property, any applications for services, privileges or
26 benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but excluding the
27 person’s declaration of candidacy.
28 (11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
29 any type of check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the
30 person by a governmental agency or by any type of company that
31 provides insurance, workers’ compensation, health care or medical
32 benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party administrator.
33 (12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
34 the person’s paycheck, paystub or employment records.
35 (13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
36 the person’s bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage
37 statements, loan statements, financial accounts, credit card accounts,
38 utility accounts or other billing statements or accounts.
39 (14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries
40 from the United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
41 (d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be
42 illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The
43 presence or absence of any particular type of evidence listed in
44 paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the person’s legal
-
*SB428*

– 6 –
1 domicile, but such a determination must be based upon all the facts
2 and circumstances of the person’s particular case.
3 8. As used in this section:
4 (a) “Actual residence” means the place of permanent habitation
5 where a person actually resides and is legally domiciled. If the
6 person maintains more than one place of permanent habitation, the
7 place the person declares to be the person’s principal permanent
8 habitation when filing a declaration of candidacy for any elective
9 office must be the place where the person actually resides and is
10 legally domiciled in order for the person to be eligible to the office.
11 (b) “Declaration of candidacy” has the meaning ascribed to it in
12 NRS 293.0455.
13 Sec. 2. NRS 282.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 282.020 Members of the Legislature and all officers, executive,
15 judicial , municipal and ministerial, shall, before they enter upon the
16 duties of their respective offices, take and subscribe to the following
17 [oath:] oaths:
18
19 1. I, ........................., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that
20 I will support, protect and defend the Constitution and
21 Government of the United States, and the Constitution and
22 government of the State of Nevada, against all enemies,
23 whether domestic or foreign, and that I will bear true faith,
24 allegiance and loyalty to the same, any ordinance, resolution
25 or law of any state notwithstanding, and that I will well and
26 faithfully perform all the duties of the office of ................, on
27 which I am about to enter; (if an oath) so help me God; (if an
28 affirmation) under the pains and penalties of perjury.
29 2. I, ........................., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am
30 not under any direct or indirect obligation to vote for, appoint,
31 elect or rule in favor of any person with respect to any office,
32 position, employment or judicial action; (if an oath) so help me
33 God; (if an affirmation) under the pains and penalties of perjury.
34 3. I, ........................., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I
35 actually reside at ........................................, that I will immediately
36 notify the appropriate entities upon a change of address, and I will
37 relinquish the office of ...................., upon the occurrence of an
38 event causing a vacancy set forth in NRS 283.040; (if an oath) so
39 help me God; (if an affirmation) under the pains and penalties of
40 perjury.
41 Sec. 3. NRS 283.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 283.040 1. Every office becomes vacant upon the occurring
43 of any of the following events before the expiration of the term:
44 (a) The death or resignation of the incumbent.
45 (b) The removal of the incumbent from office.
-
*SB428*

– 7 –
1 (c) The confirmed insanity of the incumbent, found by a court of
2 competent jurisdiction.
3 (d) A conviction of the incumbent of any felony or offense
4 involving a violation of the incumbent’s official oath or bond or a
5 violation of NRS 241.040, 293.1755 or 293C.200.
6 (e) A refusal or neglect of the person elected or appointed to
7 take the oath of office, as prescribed in NRS 282.010, or, when a
8 bond is required by law, a refusal or neglect of the person to give the
9 bond within the time prescribed by law.
10 (f) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 266.400, the ceasing of
11 the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to constructive, resident
12 of the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by
13 law in which the duties of the incumbent’s office are to be
14 exercised, or from which the incumbent was elected or appointed, or
15 in which the incumbent was required to reside to be a candidate for
16 office or appointed to office.
17 (g) The neglect or refusal of the incumbent to discharge the
18 duties of the incumbent’s office for a period of 30 days, except
19 when prevented by sickness or absence from the State or county, as
20 provided by law. In a county whose population is less than 15,000,
21 after an incumbent, other than a state officer, has been prevented by
22 sickness from discharging the duties of the incumbent’s office for at
23 least 6 months, the district attorney, either on the district attorney’s
24 own volition or at the request of another person, may petition the
25 district court to declare the office vacant. If the incumbent holds
26 the office of district attorney, the Attorney General, either on the
27 Attorney General’s own volition or at the request of another person,
28 may petition the district court to declare the office vacant. The
29 district court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to declare
30 the office vacant and, in making its determination, shall consider
31 evidence relating to:
32 (1) The medical condition of the incumbent;
33 (2) The extent to which illness, disease or physical weakness
34 has rendered the incumbent unable to manage independently and
35 perform the duties of the incumbent’s office; and
36 (3) The extent to which the absence of the incumbent has had
37 a detrimental effect on the applicable governmental entity.
38 (h) The decision of a competent tribunal declaring the election
39 or appointment void or the office vacant.
40 (i) A determination pursuant to NRS 293.182 or 293C.186 that
41 the incumbent fails to meet any qualification required for the office.
42 2. Upon the happening of any of the events described in
43 subsection 1, if the incumbent fails or refuses to relinquish the
44 incumbent’s office, the Attorney General shall, if the office is a state
45 office or concerns more than one county, or the district attorney
-
*SB428*

– 8 –
1 shall, if the office is a county office or concerns territory within one
2 county, upon his or her own recognizance or a determination that
3 probable cause exists to support a challenge filed pursuant to
4 subsection 3, commence and prosecute, in a court of competent
5 jurisdiction, any proceedings for judgment and decree declaring that
6 office vacant.
7 3. An elector with knowledge or evidence of the happening of

13 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
14 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;
15 and
16 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that
17 the filing officer determines is sufficient to verify where the
18 candidate actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in
19 accordance with NRS 281.050. The Secretary of State may adopt
20 regulations establishing the forms of alternative proof of the
21 candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to
22 verify where the candidate actually, as opposed to constructively,
23 resides in accordance with NRS 281.050.
24 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the proof of identity
25 and residency provided by the candidate pursuant to subsection 3 or
26 4. Such a copy:
27 (a) [May] Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), is a
28 public record and may not be withheld from the public; and
29 (b) Must not contain the social security number, driver’s license
30 or identification card number or account number of the candidate.
31 6. By filing the declaration of candidacy, the candidate shall be
32 deemed to have appointed the city clerk as his or her agent for
33 service of process for the purposes of a proceeding pursuant to NRS
34 293C.186. Service of such process must first be attempted at the
35 appropriate address as specified by the candidate in the declaration
36 of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at that address,
37 service must be made by personally delivering to and leaving with
38 the city clerk duplicate copies of the process. The city clerk shall
39 immediately send, by registered or certified mail, one of the copies
40 to the candidate at the specified address, unless the candidate has
41 designated in writing to the city clerk a different address for that
42 purpose, in which case the city clerk shall mail the copy to the last
43 address so designated.

1 7. If the city clerk receives credible evidence indicating that a
2 candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
3 civil rights restored, the city clerk:
4 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the
5 candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
6 candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and
7 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from
8 such investigation to the city attorney.
9 8. The receipt of information by the city attorney pursuant to
10 subsection 7 must be treated as a challenge of a candidate pursuant
11 to subsections 4 and 5 of NRS 293C.186 to which the provisions of
12 NRS 293.2045 apply.
13 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration
14 of candidacy which contains a false statement in violation of this
15 section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
16 Sec. 10. NRS 293C.186 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 293C.186 1. After a person files a declaration of candidacy to
18 be a candidate for an office, and not later than 5 days after the last
19 day the person may withdraw his or her candidacy pursuant to NRS
20 293C.195, an elector may file with the city clerk a written challenge
21 of the person on the grounds that the person fails to meet any
22 qualification required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or
23 laws of this State. Before accepting the challenge from the elector,
24 the filing officer shall notify the elector that if the challenge is found
25 by a court to be frivolous, the elector may be required to pay the
26 reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the person who is being
27 challenged.
28 2. A challenge filed pursuant to subsection 1 must:
29 (a) Indicate each qualification the person fails to meet;
30 (b) Have attached all documentation and evidence supporting
31 the challenge; and
32 (c) Be in the form of an affidavit, signed by the elector under
33 penalty of perjury.
34 3. Upon receipt of a challenge pursuant to subsection 1, the
35 city clerk shall immediately transmit the challenge to the city
36 attorney.
37 4. If the city attorney determines that probable cause exists to
38 support the challenge, the city attorney shall, not later than 5
39 working days after receiving the challenge, petition a court of
40 competent jurisdiction to order the person to appear before the court.
41 Upon receipt of such a petition, the court shall enter an order
42 directing the person to appear before the court at a hearing, at a time
43 and place to be fixed by the court in the order, to show cause why
44 the challenge is not valid. A certified copy of the order must be
45 served upon the person. The city attorney shall notify the elector
-

– 21 –
1 who filed the challenge of the time and place of the hearing. The
2 court shall give priority to such proceedings over all other matters
3 pending with the court, except for criminal proceedings.
4 5. If, at the hearing, the court determines by a preponderance of
5 the evidence that the challenge is valid or that the person otherwise
6 fails to meet any qualification required for the office pursuant to the
7 Constitution or laws of this State, or if the person fails to appear at
8 the hearing, the person is subject to the provisions of
9 NRS 293.2045.
10 6. If, at the hearing, the court determines that the challenge is
11 frivolous, the court may order the elector who filed the challenge to
12 pay the reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs of the person who
13 was challenged.
14 Sec. 11. NRS 293C.190 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 293C.190 1. A vacancy occurring in a nomination for a city
16 office before 5 p.m. of the fourth Friday in July of the year in which
17 the general city election is held must be filled by the person who
18 received the next highest vote for the nomination in the primary city
19 election if a primary city election was held for that city office. If no
20 primary city election was held for that city office or if there was not
21 more than one person who was seeking the nomination in the
22 primary city election, a person may become a candidate for the city
23 office at the general city election if the person files a declaration of
24 candidacy with the appropriate filing officer and pays the filing fee
25 established by the governing body of the city before 5 p.m. on the
26 fourth Friday in July.
27 2. No change may be made on the ballot for the general city
28 election after 5 p.m. on the fourth Friday in July of the year in which
29 the general city election is held. If, after that time and date:
30 (a) A nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally
31 incompetent; [or]
32 (b) A nominee no longer actually, as opposed to constructively,
33 resides in the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit
34 prescribed by law in which the nominee is required to reside to be
35 a candidate for office; or
36 (c) A vacancy in the nomination is otherwise created,
37  the nominee’s name must remain on the ballot for the general city
38 election and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
