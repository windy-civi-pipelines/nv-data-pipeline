Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, for the purpose of determining a person’s eligibility for public
2 office, the residence of a person is the person’s actual residence within the State, county,
3 district, ward, subdistrict or other unit prescribed by law. (NRS 281.050) Section 1 of this bill
4 provides that it is the public policy of this State to ensure that a person continues to reside in
5 the area prescribed by law for the office during the entire term of the office.
6 Existing law requires members of the Legislature and all public officers, executive,
7 judicial and ministerial, to take an oath of office before entering upon their duties of office.
8 (NRS 282.020) Section 2 of this bill requires all members of the Legislature and public
9 officers to swear additional oaths under penalty of perjury, including that they will relinquish
10 office under certain circumstances. Sections 1.5 and 3 of this bill make conforming changes
11 to provide that public officers must take and subscribe to more than one oath.
12 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a public office becomes vacant upon certain
13 events, including the ceasing of the incumbent to be an actual, as opposed to constructive,
14 resident of the State, district, county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the
15 duties of the incumbent are to be exercised, or from which the incumbent was elected or
16 appointed, or in which the incumbent was required to reside to be a candidate for office or
17 appointed to office. If, upon the happening of such an event, the incumbent fails or refuses to
18 relinquish the office, existing law requires the Attorney General or district attorney to commence
19 and prosecute proceedings to declare the office vacant. (NRS 283.040) Section 3 [of this bill]
20 authorizes an elector with knowledge or evidence of the happening of such an event to file with

Senate Amendment No. 331 to Senate Bill No. 428 Page 4
21 the Attorney General or district attorney a challenge to the incumbent on the grounds that a
22 vacancy has occurred because the event has occurred.
23 Under existing law, if a vacancy occurs in a major or minor political party nomination for a
24 partisan office before a certain date in July of the year in which the general election is held
25 because the nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally incompetent, the party central
26 committee or executive committee may designate a candidate to fill the nomination and the board
27 of county commissioners in certain legislative districts comprising more than one county may
28 vote to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy and in all other cases, the nominee’s name must
29 remain on the ballot and, if elected, a vacancy exists. (NRS 293.165, 293.166) Sections 4 and 5
30 of this bill provide that if a vacancy occurs before a certain date in July in the year in which the
31 general election is held because the nominee no longer actually resides in the State, county, city,
32 ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the nominee is required to reside to be a candidate
33 for office, the party central committee or executive committee may designate a candidate to fill
34 the vacancy and the board of county commissioners in certain legislative districts comprising
35 more than one county may vote to appoint a candidate to fill the vacancy.
36 Section 11 of this bill provides that if a vacancy in nomination occurs for a city office
37 after a certain date in July because the nominee no longer actually resides in the State, district,
38 county, city, ward or other unit prescribed by law in which the nominee is required to reside to
39 be a candidate for office, the nominee’s name must remain on the ballot and, if elected, a
40 vacancy exists.
41 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a name may not be printed on a ballot for
42 primary election unless the candidate, including a candidate appointed to fill a vacancy in a
43 nomination, has filed a declaration of candidacy which must be accompanied by proof of
44 identity and residency of the candidate. The filing officer is required to retain a copy of the
45 proof of identity and residency which, except for certain confidential information, may not be
46 withheld from the public. (NRS 293.177, 293C.185) Sections 6 and 9 of this bill provide that,
47 except for certain confidential information, such proof of identity and residency is a public
48 record.
49 Existing law authorizes an elector to file with the filing officer for an office a written
50 challenge to a person on the grounds that the person fails to meet a qualification for office. If
51 probable cause exists to support the challenge, existing law requires the Attorney General,
52 district attorney or city attorney to petition a court of competent jurisdiction regarding the
53 issue. (NRS 293.182, 293C.186) Sections 7 and 10 of this bill require the Attorney General or
54 district attorney to notify the elector who filed the challenge of the time and place of a hearing
55 scheduled on the challenge.
56 Existing law requires the Secretary of State and county clerk to forward to each other a
57 certified list containing the name and mailing address of each person for whom candidacy
58 papers have been filed. (NRS 293.187) Section 8 of this bill requires the certified list to
59 contain the residential address where the person actually resides and the mailing address, if
60 different than the residential address.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or her eligibility
3 to any office is the person’s actual residence within the State, county, district, ward,
4 subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the
5 period for which residence is claimed by the person.
6 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any person absents
7 himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that person’s actual residence with the
8 intention in good faith to return without delay and continue such actual residence,
9 the period of absence must not be considered in determining the question of
10 residence.

Senate Amendment No. 331 to Senate Bill No. 428 Page 5
1 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any elective office
2 moves the person’s actual residence out of the State, county, district, ward,
3 subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by law, as the case may be, in which the
4 person is required actually, as opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the
5 person to be eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the appropriate
6 action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
7 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be deemed to
8 have moved the person’s actual residence for the purposes of this section if:
9 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed himself or
10 herself from the place of permanent habitation where the person actually resided
11 and was legally domiciled;
12 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of permanent habitation
13 where the person actually resided and was legally domiciled; and
14 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of permanent
15 habitation where the person actually resides and is legally domiciled.
16 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS 293.1265, the
17 district court has jurisdiction to determine the question of residence in any
18 preelection action for declaratory judgment brought against a person who has filed
19 a declaration of candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence
20 relates to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning residence
21 required for the term of office in which the incumbent is presently serving, the
22 district court does not have jurisdiction to determine the question of residence in an
23 action for declaratory judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
24 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action to declare the
25 office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and brought by the Attorney
26 General or the appropriate district attorney pursuant to that section.
27 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any preelection action
28 for declaratory judgment, the district court finds that a person who has filed a
29 declaration of candidacy for any elective office fails to meet any qualification
30 concerning residence required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of
31 this State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
32 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a place of
33 permanent habitation is the place where a person actually resides and is legally
34 domiciled:
35 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences and to ensure
36 that the person actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in the area prescribed
37 by law for the office and actually continues to reside in the area prescribed by law
38 for the office during the entire term of the office so the person has an actual
39 connection with the constituents who reside in the area and has particular
40 knowledge of their concerns.
41 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one legal domicile,
42 and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact of actual living in the place
43 and the intention to remain there as a permanent residence. If the person
44 temporarily leaves the person’s legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose,
45 and does not take up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
46 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed, the fact of
47 actual living in another place, the intention to remain in the other place and the
48 intention to abandon the former legal domicile must all exist before the person’s
49 legal domicile can change.
50 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without limitation:
51 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time and the length
52 of time the person has lived in that place.

Senate Amendment No. 331 to Senate Bill No. 428 Page 6
1 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s spouse or domestic
2 partner, if any.
3 (3) The place where the person lives with the person’s children, dependents
4 or relatives, if any.
5 (4) The place where the person lives with any other individual whose
6 relationship with the person is substantially similar to a relationship with a spouse,
7 domestic partner, child, dependent or relative.
8 (5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if any, live.
9 (6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the voter
10 registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the person.
11 (7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any driver’s
12 license or identification card issued to the person by the Department of Motor
13 Vehicles, any passport or military identification card issued to the person by the
14 United States or any other form of identification issued to the person by a
15 governmental agency.
16 (8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any registration
17 for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the Department of Motor Vehicles or
18 any registration for another type of vehicle or mode of transportation, including,
19 without limitation, any aircraft, vessels or watercraft, issued to the person by a
20 governmental agency.
21 (9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any applications
22 for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate, registration, permit or similar
23 type of authorization issued to the person by a governmental agency which has the
24 authority to regulate an occupation or profession.
25 (10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any document
26 which the person is authorized or required by law to file or record with a
27 governmental agency, including, without limitation, any deed, declaration of
28 homestead or other record of real or personal property, any applications for
29 services, privileges or benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but
30 excluding the person’s declaration of candidacy.
31 (11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any type of
32 check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the person by a governmental
33 agency or by any type of company that provides insurance, workers’ compensation,
34 health care or medical benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party
35 administrator.
36 (12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the person’s
37 paycheck, paystub or employment records.
38 (13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the person’s
39 bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage statements, loan statements,
40 financial accounts, credit card accounts, utility accounts or other billing statements
41 or accounts.
42 (14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries from the
43 United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
44 (d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be illustrative and is not
45 intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The presence or absence of any particular
46 type of evidence listed in paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the
47 person’s legal domicile, but such a determination must be based upon all the facts
48 and circumstances of the person’s particular case.
49 8. As used in this section:
50 (a) “Actual residence” means the place of permanent habitation where a person
51 actually resides and is legally domiciled. If the person maintains more than one
52 place of permanent habitation, the place the person declares to be the person’s
53 principal permanent habitation when filing a declaration of candidacy for any

1 elective office must be the place where the person actually resides and is legally
2 domiciled in order for the person to be eligible to the office.

4 293.0455.

45 General shall, if the office is a state office or concerns more than one county, or the

47 one county, upon his or her own recognizance or a determination that probable
48 cause exists to support a challenge filed pursuant to subsection 3, commence and
49 prosecute, in a court of competent jurisdiction, any proceedings for judgment and
50 decree declaring that office vacant.

13 or to punish, impeach, expel or remove from office the Governor, other state and
14 judicial officers or State Legislators.

20 of the minor political party subject to the provisions of subsections 3, 4 and 5.
21 2. A vacancy occurring in a nonpartisan office or nomination for a
22 nonpartisan office after the close of filing and before 5 p.m. of the fourth Friday in
23 July of the year in which the general election is held must be filled by the person
24 who receives or received the next highest vote for the nomination in the primary
25 election if a primary election was held for that nonpartisan office. If no primary
26 election was held for that nonpartisan office or if there was not more than one
27 person who was seeking the nonpartisan nomination in the primary election, a
28 person may become a candidate for the nonpartisan office at the general election if

40 determined pursuant to NRS 281.050, 283.040 or 293.182, as applicable, the
41 vacancy may be filled by a candidate designated by the party central committee of
42 the county or State, as the case may be, of the major political party.
43 (b) The vacancy occurs for a reason other than the reasons described in
44 paragraph (a), the nominee’s name must remain on the ballot for the general
45 election and, if elected, a vacancy exists.
46 4. No change may be made on the ballot for the general election after 5 p.m.

48 after that time and date:
49 (a) A nominee dies or is adjudicated insane or mentally incompetent; [or]
50 (b) A nominee no longer actually, as opposed to constructively, resides in the

9 Sec. 5. NRS 293.166 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 293.166 1. A vacancy occurring in a party nomination for the office of State
11 Senator, Assemblyman or Assemblywoman from a legislative district comprising
12 more than one county may be filled as follows, subject to the provisions of
13 subsections 2, 3 and 4. The county commissioners of each county, all or part of
14 which is included within the legislative district, shall meet to appoint a person who
15 is of the same political party as the former nominee and who actually, as opposed to
16 constructively, resides in the district to fill the vacancy, with the chair of the board
17 of county commissioners of the county whose population residing within the
18 district is the greatest presiding. Each board of county commissioners shall first
19 meet separately and determine the single candidate it will nominate to fill the
20 vacancy. Then, the boards shall meet jointly and the chairs on behalf of the boards
21 shall cast a proportionate number of votes according to the percent, rounded to the
22 nearest whole percent, which the population of its county is of the population of the
23 entire district. Populations must be determined by the last decennial census or
24 special census conducted by the Bureau of the Census of the United States
25 Department of Commerce. The person who receives a plurality of these votes is
26 appointed to fill the vacancy. If no person receives a plurality of the votes, the

5 candidate in the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at that

17 restored; and
18 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from such

52 later than 5 working days after receiving the challenge, petition a court of
53 competent jurisdiction to order the person to appear before the court. Upon receipt

Senate Amendment No. 331 to Senate Bill No. 428 Page 15
1 of such a petition, the court shall enter an order directing the person to appear
2 before the court at a hearing, at a time and place to be fixed by the court in the
3 order, to show cause why the challenge is not valid. A certified copy of the order
4 must be served upon the person. The Attorney General or district attorney shall

9 that the challenge is valid or that the person otherwise fails to meet any
10 qualification required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
11 State, or if the person fails to appear at the hearing, the person is subject to the
12 provisions of NRS 293.2045.
