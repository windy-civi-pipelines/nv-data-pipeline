Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a person who wishes to obtain certain postdoctoral experience
2 in psychology to register with the Board of Psychological Examiners as a psychological
3 assistant; and (2) authorizes a person who is in a doctoral training program or certain
4 doctorate-level training and who wishes to engage in a predoctoral internship or to perform
5 professional activities under the supervision of a psychologist outside of a formal internship to
6 register with the Board as a psychological intern or psychological trainee, respectively. (NRS
7 641.226) Section 13 of this bill : (1) provides for [such persons] psychological assistants and
8 psychological interns to instead obtain a provisional license [as a psychological assistant,
9 psychological intern or psychological trainee, as applicable.] ; and (2) revises the provisions
10 governing the registration of psychological trainees. Section 13 provides that [: (1)] a
11 person seeking a provisional license as a psychological intern [or psychological trainee] must
12 have completed any courses required for his or her doctoral training program or doctorate-
13 level training . [; and (2) a provisional license as a psychological intern or psychological
14 trainee expires 1 year after issuance, rather than 2 years after issuance, unless the provisional
15 license is renewed. Section 13 further provides that the holder of a provisional license as a
16 psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological trainee may take the national
17 exam and any other examination authorized by the Board for full licensure as a psychologist.
18 Existing law authorizes the Board to charge and collect a fee of not more than $250 for
19 the initial registration of a psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological
20 trainee and a fee of not more than $150 for the renewal of such a registration. (NRS 641.228)

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a person who wishes to obtain certain postdoctoral experience
2 in psychology to register with the Board of Psychological Examiners as a psychological
3 assistant; and (2) authorizes a person who is in a doctoral training program or certain
4 doctorate-level training and who wishes to engage in a predoctoral internship or to perform
5 professional activities under the supervision of a psychologist outside of a formal internship to
6 register with the Board as a psychological intern or psychological trainee, respectively. (NRS
7 641.226) Section 13 of this bill : (1) provides for [such persons] psychological assistants and
8 psychological interns to instead obtain a provisional license [as a psychological assistant,
9 psychological intern or psychological trainee, as applicable.] ; and (2) revises the provisions
10 governing the registration of psychological trainees. Section 13 provides that [: (1)] a
11 person seeking a provisional license as a psychological intern [or psychological trainee] must
12 have completed any courses required for his or her doctoral training program or doctorate-
13 level training . [; and (2) a provisional license as a psychological intern or psychological
14 trainee expires 1 year after issuance, rather than 2 years after issuance, unless the provisional
15 license is renewed. Section 13 further provides that the holder of a provisional license as a
16 psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological trainee may take the national
17 exam and any other examination authorized by the Board for full licensure as a psychologist.
18 Existing law authorizes the Board to charge and collect a fee of not more than $250 for
19 the initial registration of a psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological
20 trainee and a fee of not more than $150 for the renewal of such a registration. (NRS 641.228)
21 Section 14 of this bill reduces the fee that the Board is authorized to charge and collect for an
22 initial provisional license as a psychological intern or psychological trainee and the fee for the
23 renewal of such a provisional license to not more than $25.]
24 Sections 1-12 and [15-28] 14-28 of this bill make conforming changes to [replace]
