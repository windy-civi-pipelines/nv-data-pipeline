governing the registration of psychological trainees; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires a person who wishes to obtain certain postdoctoral
experience in psychology to register with the Board of Psychological Examiners as
a psychological assistant; and (2) authorizes a person who is in a doctoral training
program or certain doctorate-level training and who wishes to engage in a
predoctoral internship or to perform professional activities under the supervision of
a psychologist outside of a formal internship to register with the Board as a
psychological intern or psychological trainee, respectively. (NRS 641.226) Section
13 of this bill: (1) provides for psychological assistants and psychological interns to
instead obtain a provisional license; and (2) revises the provisions governing the
registration of psychological trainees. Section 13 provides that a person seeking a
provisional license as a psychological intern must have completed any courses
required for his or her doctoral training program or doctorate-level training.
Sections 1-12 and 14-28 of this bill make conforming changes to include, in
addition to references to registration as a psychological trainee, references to the
issuance of a provisional license as a psychological assistant or psychological
intern.
