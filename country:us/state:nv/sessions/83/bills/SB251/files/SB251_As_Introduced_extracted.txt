Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a person who wishes to obtain certain postdoctoral
2 experience in psychology to register with the Board of Psychological Examiners as
3 a psychological assistant; and (2) authorizes a person who is in a doctoral training
4 program or certain doctorate-level training and who wishes to engage in a
5 predoctoral internship or to perform professional activities under the supervision of
6 a psychologist outside of a formal internship to register with the Board as a
7 psychological intern or psychological trainee, respectively. (NRS 641.226) Section
8 13 of this bill provides for such persons to instead obtain a provisional license as a
9 psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological trainee, as applicable.
10 Section 13 provides that: (1) a person seeking a provisional license as a
11 psychological intern or psychological trainee must have completed any courses
12 required for his or her doctoral training program or doctorate-level training; and (2)
13 a provisional license as a psychological intern or psychological trainee expires 1
14 year after issuance, rather than 2 years after issuance, unless the provisional license
15 is renewed. Section 13 further provides that the holder of a provisional license as a
16 psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological trainee may take the
17 national exam and any other examination authorized by the Board for full licensure
18 as a psychologist.
19 Existing law authorizes the Board to charge and collect a fee of not more than
20 $250 for the initial registration of a psychological assistant, psychological intern or
-

21 psychological trainee and a fee of not more than $150 for the renewal of such a
22 registration. (NRS 641.228) Section 14 of this bill reduces the fee that the Board is
23 authorized to charge and collect for an initial provisional license as a psychological
24 intern or psychological trainee and the fee for the renewal of such a provisional
25 license to not more than $25.
26 Sections 1-12 and 15-28 of this bill make conforming changes to replace
27 references to registration as a psychological assistant, psychological intern and
28 psychological trainee with references to a provisional license.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to psychologists; providing for the issuance of a
provisional license to psychological assistants,
psychological interns and psychological trainees; revising
certain fees charged to psychological assistants,

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a person who wishes to obtain certain postdoctoral
2 experience in psychology to register with the Board of Psychological Examiners as
3 a psychological assistant; and (2) authorizes a person who is in a doctoral training
4 program or certain doctorate-level training and who wishes to engage in a
5 predoctoral internship or to perform professional activities under the supervision of
6 a psychologist outside of a formal internship to register with the Board as a
7 psychological intern or psychological trainee, respectively. (NRS 641.226) Section
8 13 of this bill provides for such persons to instead obtain a provisional license as a
9 psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological trainee, as applicable.
10 Section 13 provides that: (1) a person seeking a provisional license as a
11 psychological intern or psychological trainee must have completed any courses
12 required for his or her doctoral training program or doctorate-level training; and (2)
13 a provisional license as a psychological intern or psychological trainee expires 1
14 year after issuance, rather than 2 years after issuance, unless the provisional license
15 is renewed. Section 13 further provides that the holder of a provisional license as a
16 psychological assistant, psychological intern or psychological trainee may take the
17 national exam and any other examination authorized by the Board for full licensure
18 as a psychologist.
19 Existing law authorizes the Board to charge and collect a fee of not more than
20 $250 for the initial registration of a psychological assistant, psychological intern or
-

– 2 –
21 psychological trainee and a fee of not more than $150 for the renewal of such a
22 registration. (NRS 641.228) Section 14 of this bill reduces the fee that the Board is
23 authorized to charge and collect for an initial provisional license as a psychological
24 intern or psychological trainee and the fee for the renewal of such a provisional
25 license to not more than $25.
26 Sections 1-12 and 15-28 of this bill make conforming changes to replace
27 references to registration as a psychological assistant, psychological intern and
28 psychological trainee with references to a provisional license.
