AN ACT relating to [governmental administration;] taxation; authorizing the
Department of Taxation to deliver by electronic means notices,
decisions and other written communications under certain
circumstances; authorizing the Board of Economic Development to
deny an application for an abatement, partial abatement or
transferable tax credits under certain circumstances; revising the
manner in which the Department determines the industry in which a
business is engaged for the purposes of the commerce tax; revising the
due date for the payment of sales and use taxes; authorizing
businesses that recycle certain materials or produce certain fuels
from recycled materials to apply to the Office of Economic
Development for a partial abatement of certain taxes; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section [1] 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by electronic
2 means any notice, decision or other written communication that the Department is required to
3 provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the person has opted out of receiving such
4 notices, decisions or written communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of
5 law specifies the means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
6 written communication. Under section [1,] 1.3, the electronic means by which the Department
7 may send notices, decisions and other written communications are: (1) delivery to a secure
8 account of a person who has registered for an account with an electronic system maintained
9 by the Department; (2) delivery to an electronic mail address at which a person has agreed to
10 receive notices, decisions and other written communications from the Department; and (3)
11 posting a notice, decision or other written communication on an electronic network or Internet
12 website maintained by the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a
13 mobile application and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic mail
14 address of the person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department is required to
15 continue to provide notice by personal service or by mail of determinations of deficiency in

Senate Amendment No. 977 to Assembly Bill No. 594 First Reprint Page 4
16 the payment of taxes or the suspension or revocation of certain permits issued by the
17 Department. (NRS 360.350, 360.5975)
18 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
19 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property taxes,
20 business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain circumstances.
21 (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759, 360.889,
22 360.945) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Economic Development to deny,
23 or approve for a lesser amount, an application for an abatement, partial abatement or
24 transferable tax credits if the Board determines that approving the full amount applied
25 for is not in the best interests of the State. Section 1.5 lists certain factors that the Board
26 may consider in determining whether granting the full amount applied for is in the best
27 interests of the State.
28 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
29 imposed on real property for a business that: (1) engages in the primary trade of
30 preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
31 intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled materials or includes as a
32 primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled material;
33 and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the substitution of other
34 sources of energy for fossil fuel sources of energy. (NRS 701A.210) Section 7.5 of this bill
35 authorizes the Office to grant such a partial abatement of property taxes to a business
36 that: (1) includes as a primary component a facility for the production of biofuels,
37 biomass or other primary fuels from recycled material to produce energy; or (2)
38 primarily engages in the recycling or repurposing of materials that were used to produce
39 or store renewable energy, including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels
40 or waste materials resulting from the extraction of minerals.
41 Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain business
42 entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable year, at a rate that is
43 based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged. (Chapter 363C of NRS) Section
44 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law that provides that for the purpose of
45 determining the commerce tax rate of a business entity, the industry in which a business entity
46 is engaged is determined based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry
47 Classification System (“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States
48 Department of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
49 industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most recent edition
50 of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in the publishing, software
51 and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022 version of the NAICS, which is the
52 most recent version published by the Bureau of the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of
53 this bill provides that the changes made by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years
54 commencing on or after July 1, 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the
55 changes made by those sections to previous taxable years.
56 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or use tax is
57 required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of the month after the
58 tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill revise the due date for
59 remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to be remitted to the Department on or
60 before the 20th day of the month after the tax was imposed. Sections 14 and 15 of this bill
61 provide that the change to the due date for remitting sales and use taxes to the Department
62 applies only to a taxable period beginning on or after January 1, 2026, thereby prohibiting
63 retroactive application of the change to such due date to taxable periods beginning before
64 January 1, 2026.
