AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing the Department of
Taxation to deliver by electronic means notices, decisions
and other written communications under certain
circumstances; authorizing the Board of Economic
Development to deny an application for an abatement, partial
abatement or transferable tax credits under certain
circumstances; revising the manner in which the Department
determines the industry in which a business is engaged for
the purposes of the commerce tax; revising the due date for
the payment of sales and use taxes; authorizing businesses

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by
electronic means any notice, decision or other written communication that the
Department is required to provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the
person has opted out of receiving such notices, decisions or written
communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of law specifies the
means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
written communication. Under section 1.3, the electronic means by which the
Department may send notices, decisions and other written communications are: (1)
delivery to a secure account of a person who has registered for an account with an
electronic system maintained by the Department; (2) delivery to an electronic mail
address at which a person has agreed to receive notices, decisions and other written
communications from the Department; and (3) posting a notice, decision or other
written communication on an electronic network or Internet website maintained by
the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a mobile application
and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic mail address of the
person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department is required to
continue to provide notice by personal service or by mail of determinations of
deficiency in the payment of taxes or the suspension or revocation of certain
permits issued by the Department. (NRS 360.350, 360.5975)
Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
circumstances. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753,
360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Board
of Economic Development to deny, or approve for a lesser amount, an application
for an abatement, partial abatement or transferable tax credits if the Board
determines that approving the full amount applied for is not in the best interests of
the State. Section 1.5 lists certain factors that the Board may consider in
determining whether granting the full amount applied for is in the best interests of
the State.

Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
imposed on real property for a business that: (1) engages in the primary trade of
preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled materials or includes as
a primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled
material; and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the
substitution of other sources of energy for fossil fuel sources of energy. (NRS
701A.210) Section 7.5 of this bill authorizes the Office to grant such a partial
abatement of property taxes to a business that: (1) includes as a primary component
a facility for the production of biofuels, biomass or other primary fuels from
recycled material to produce energy; or (2) primarily engages in the recycling or
repurposing of materials that were used to produce or store renewable energy,
including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels or waste materials
resulting from the extraction of minerals.
Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain
business entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable
year, at a rate that is based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged.
(Chapter 363C of NRS) Section 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law
that provides that for the purpose of determining the commerce tax rate of a
business entity, the industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined
based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry Classification System
(“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States Department
of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most
recent edition of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in
the publishing, software and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022
version of the NAICS, which is the most recent version published by the Bureau of
the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of this bill provides that the changes made
by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years commencing on or after July 1,
2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the changes made by those
sections to previous taxable years.
Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or
use tax is required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of
the month after the tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of
this bill revise the due date for remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to
be remitted to the Department on or before the 20th day of the month after the tax
was imposed. Sections 14 and 15 of this bill provide that the change to the due date
for remitting sales and use taxes to the Department applies only to a taxable period
beginning on or after January 1, 2026, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of
the change to such due date to taxable periods beginning before January 1, 2026.
