EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the
Department of Taxation to deliver by electronic means
notices, decisions and other written communications
under certain circumstances; revising the manner in which
the Department determines the industry in which a
business is engaged for the purposes of the commerce tax;
revising the due date for the payment of sales and use
taxes; authorizing certain employees of the Department to
electronically notarize electronic documents created by
the Department; authorizing the recording with a county
recorder of a paper copy of electronic documents created
by the Department under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by
2 electronic means any notice, decision or other written communication that the
3 Department is required to provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the
4 person has opted out of receiving such notices, decisions or written
5 communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of law specifies the
6 means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
7 written communication. Under section 1, the electronic means by which the
8 Department may send notices, decisions and other written communications are: (1)
9 delivery to a secure account of a person who has registered for an account with an
10 electronic system maintained by the Department; (2) delivery to an electronic mail
11 address at which a person has agreed to receive notices, decisions and other written
-
*AB594*
– 2 –
12 communications from the Department; and (3) posting a notice, decision or other
13 written communication on an electronic network or Internet website maintained by
14 the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a mobile application
15 and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic mail address of the
16 person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department is required to
17 continue to provide notice by personal service or by mail of determinations of
18 deficiency in the payment of taxes or the suspension or revocation of certain
19 permits issued by the Department. (NRS 360.350, 360.5975)
20 Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain
21 business entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable
22 year, at a rate that is based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged.
23 (Chapter 363C of NRS) Section 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law
24 that provides that for the purpose of determining the commerce tax rate of a
25 business entity, the industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined
26 based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry Classification System
27 (“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States Department
28 of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
29 industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most
30 recent edition of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in
31 the publishing, software and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022
32 version of the NAICS, which is the most recent version published by the Bureau of
33 the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of this bill provides that the changes made
34 by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years commencing on or after July 1,
35 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the changes made by those
36 sections to previous taxable years.
37 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or
38 use tax is required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of
39 the month after the tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of
40 this bill revise the due date for remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to
41 be remitted to the Department on or before the 20th day of the month after the tax
42 was imposed. Section 14 provides that the change to the due date for remitting
43 sales and use taxes to the Department applies on only to taxable period beginning
44 on or after July 1, 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the change to
45 such due date.
46 Existing law establishes requirements for the filing with a county recorder of
47 documents creating an interest in real property or otherwise affecting real property,
48 including, without limitation, requirements for the document to contain the
49 signature or electronic signature of each person executing the document and to be
50 notarized by a notary public or other notarial officer. (NRS 111.010, 111.240,
51 111.265, 111.3685, 247.190) Under existing law, the Department files with county
52 recorders for recording certain documents, including, without limitation, certificates
53 creating liens on the real and personal property of a taxpayer for delinquent taxes,
54 fees, penalties and interest, and certificates releasing or subordinating such liens.
55 (NRS 360.473, 360.475) Section 8 of this bill establishes a manner in which such
56 electronic documents may be electronically notarized by an employee of the
57 Department who is a notary public and in good standing with the Secretary of State.
58 Under sections 8 and 11 of this bill, such an employee of the Department is
59 authorized to electronically notarize the electronic document without becoming
60 registered as an electronic notary public under existing law. (NRS 240.192) Section
61 9 of this bill makes the definitions in existing law governing the electronic
62 notarization of electronic documents applicable to section 8. Section 10 of this bill
63 makes the provisions of existing law governing the notarization of documents
64 applicable to the electronic notarization pursuant to section 8. Section 12 of this
65 bill authorizes the Department to file for recording with a county recorder a paper
-

66 copy of the electronic document containing the electronic signature of an employee
67 of the Department and the electronic notarization authorized by section 8.

EXEMPT
A.B. 594
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 594–COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS
(ON BEHALF OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCE
IN THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR)
MAY 21, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the Department of
Taxation. (BDR 32-1130)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the
Department of Taxation to deliver by electronic means
notices, decisions and other written communications
under certain circumstances; revising the manner in which
the Department determines the industry in which a
business is engaged for the purposes of the commerce tax;
revising the due date for the payment of sales and use
taxes; authorizing certain employees of the Department to
electronically notarize electronic documents created by
the Department; authorizing the recording with a county
recorder of a paper copy of electronic documents created
by the Department under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by
2 electronic means any notice, decision or other written communication that the
3 Department is required to provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the
4 person has opted out of receiving such notices, decisions or written
5 communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of law specifies the
6 means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
7 written communication. Under section 1, the electronic means by which the
8 Department may send notices, decisions and other written communications are: (1)
9 delivery to a secure account of a person who has registered for an account with an
10 electronic system maintained by the Department; (2) delivery to an electronic mail
11 address at which a person has agreed to receive notices, decisions and other written
-
*AB594*

– 2 –
12 communications from the Department; and (3) posting a notice, decision or other
13 written communication on an electronic network or Internet website maintained by
14 the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a mobile application
15 and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic mail address of the
16 person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department is required to
17 continue to provide notice by personal service or by mail of determinations of
18 deficiency in the payment of taxes or the suspension or revocation of certain
19 permits issued by the Department. (NRS 360.350, 360.5975)
20 Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain
21 business entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable
22 year, at a rate that is based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged.
23 (Chapter 363C of NRS) Section 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law
24 that provides that for the purpose of determining the commerce tax rate of a
25 business entity, the industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined
26 based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry Classification System
27 (“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States Department
28 of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
29 industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most
30 recent edition of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in
31 the publishing, software and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022
32 version of the NAICS, which is the most recent version published by the Bureau of
33 the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of this bill provides that the changes made
34 by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years commencing on or after July 1,
35 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the changes made by those
36 sections to previous taxable years.
37 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or
38 use tax is required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of
39 the month after the tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of
40 this bill revise the due date for remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to
41 be remitted to the Department on or before the 20th day of the month after the tax
42 was imposed. Section 14 provides that the change to the due date for remitting
43 sales and use taxes to the Department applies on only to taxable period beginning
44 on or after July 1, 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the change to
45 such due date.
46 Existing law establishes requirements for the filing with a county recorder of
47 documents creating an interest in real property or otherwise affecting real property,
48 including, without limitation, requirements for the document to contain the
49 signature or electronic signature of each person executing the document and to be
50 notarized by a notary public or other notarial officer. (NRS 111.010, 111.240,
51 111.265, 111.3685, 247.190) Under existing law, the Department files with county
52 recorders for recording certain documents, including, without limitation, certificates
53 creating liens on the real and personal property of a taxpayer for delinquent taxes,
54 fees, penalties and interest, and certificates releasing or subordinating such liens.
55 (NRS 360.473, 360.475) Section 8 of this bill establishes a manner in which such
56 electronic documents may be electronically notarized by an employee of the
57 Department who is a notary public and in good standing with the Secretary of State.
58 Under sections 8 and 11 of this bill, such an employee of the Department is
59 authorized to electronically notarize the electronic document without becoming
60 registered as an electronic notary public under existing law. (NRS 240.192) Section
61 9 of this bill makes the definitions in existing law governing the electronic
62 notarization of electronic documents applicable to section 8. Section 10 of this bill
63 makes the provisions of existing law governing the notarization of documents
64 applicable to the electronic notarization pursuant to section 8. Section 12 of this
65 bill authorizes the Department to file for recording with a county recorder a paper

66 copy of the electronic document containing the electronic signature of an employee
67 of the Department and the electronic notarization authorized by section 8.
