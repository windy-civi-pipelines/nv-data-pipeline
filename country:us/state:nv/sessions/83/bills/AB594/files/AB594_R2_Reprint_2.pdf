Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by
2 electronic means any notice, decision or other written communication that the
3 Department is required to provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the
4 person has opted out of receiving such notices, decisions or written
5 communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of law specifies the
6 means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
7 written communication. Under section 1.3, the electronic means by which the
8 Department may send notices, decisions and other written communications are:
-
*AB594_R2*

– 2 –
9 (1) delivery to a secure account of a person who has registered for an account with
10 an electronic system maintained by the Department; (2) delivery to an electronic
11 mail address at which a person has agreed to receive notices, decisions and other
12 written communications from the Department; and (3) posting a notice, decision or
13 other written communication on an electronic network or Internet website
14 maintained by the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a
15 mobile application and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic
16 mail address of the person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department
17 is required to continue to provide notice by personal service or by mail of
18 determinations of deficiency in the payment of taxes or the suspension or
19 revocation of certain permits issued by the Department. (NRS 360.350, 360.5975)
20 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
21 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
22 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
23 circumstances. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753,
24 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Board
25 of Economic Development to deny, or approve for a lesser amount, an application
26 for an abatement, partial abatement or transferable tax credits if the Board
27 determines that approving the full amount applied for is not in the best interests of
28 the State. Section 1.5 lists certain factors that the Board may consider in
29 determining whether granting the full amount applied for is in the best interests of
30 the State.
31 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
32 imposed on real property for a business that: (1) engages in the primary trade of
33 preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
34 intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled materials or includes as
35 a primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled
36 material; and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the
37 substitution of other sources of energy for fossil fuel sources of energy. (NRS
38 701A.210) Section 7.5 of this bill authorizes the Office to grant such a partial
39 abatement of property taxes to a business that: (1) includes as a primary component
40 a facility for the production of biofuels, biomass or other primary fuels from
41 recycled material to produce energy; or (2) primarily engages in the recycling or
42 repurposing of materials that were used to produce or store renewable energy,
43 including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels or waste materials
44 resulting from the extraction of minerals.
45 Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain
46 business entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable
47 year, at a rate that is based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged.
48 (Chapter 363C of NRS) Section 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law
49 that provides that for the purpose of determining the commerce tax rate of a
50 business entity, the industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined
51 based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry Classification System
52 (“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States Department
53 of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
54 industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most
55 recent edition of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in
56 the publishing, software and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022
57 version of the NAICS, which is the most recent version published by the Bureau of
58 the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of this bill provides that the changes made
59 by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years commencing on or after July 1,
60 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the changes made by those
61 sections to previous taxable years.
62 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or
63 use tax is required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of
-
*AB594_R2*

– 3 –
64 the month after the tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of
65 this bill revise the due date for remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to
66 be remitted to the Department on or before the 20th day of the month after the tax
67 was imposed. Sections 14 and 15 of this bill provide that the change to the due date
68 for remitting sales and use taxes to the Department applies only to a taxable period
69 beginning on or after January 1, 2026, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of
70 the change to such due date to taxable periods beginning before January 1, 2026.

19 factors, with respect to the business that is the subject of the
20 application:
