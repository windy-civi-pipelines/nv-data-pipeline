~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the
Department of Taxation to deliver by electronic means
notices, decisions and other written communications
under certain circumstances; revising the manner in which
the Department determines the industry in which a
business is engaged for the purposes of the commerce tax;
revising the due date for the payment of sales and use
taxes; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by
2 electronic means any notice, decision or other written communication that the
3 Department is required to provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the
4 person has opted out of receiving such notices, decisions or written
5 communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of law specifies the
6 means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
7 written communication. Under section 1, the electronic means by which the
8 Department may send notices, decisions and other written communications are: (1)
9 delivery to a secure account of a person who has registered for an account with an
10 electronic system maintained by the Department; (2) delivery to an electronic mail
11 address at which a person has agreed to receive notices, decisions and other written
12 communications from the Department; and (3) posting a notice, decision or other
13 written communication on an electronic network or Internet website maintained by
14 the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a mobile application
15 and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic mail address of the
16 person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department is required to

– 2 –
17 continue to provide notice by personal service or by mail of determinations of
18 deficiency in the payment of taxes or the suspension or revocation of certain
19 permits issued by the Department. (NRS 360.350, 360.5975)
20 Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain
21 business entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable
22 year, at a rate that is based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged.
23 (Chapter 363C of NRS) Section 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law
24 that provides that for the purpose of determining the commerce tax rate of a
25 business entity, the industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined
26 based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry Classification System
27 (“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States Department
28 of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
29 industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most
30 recent edition of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in
31 the publishing, software and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022
32 version of the NAICS, which is the most recent version published by the Bureau of
33 the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of this bill provides that the changes made
34 by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years commencing on or after July 1,
35 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the changes made by those
36 sections to previous taxable years.
37 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or
38 use tax is required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of
39 the month after the tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of
40 this bill revise the due date for remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to
41 be remitted to the Department on or before the 20th day of the month after the tax
42 was imposed. Sections 14 and 15 provide that the change to the due date for
43 remitting sales and use taxes to the Department applies only to a taxable period
44 beginning on or after January 1, 2026, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of
45 the change to such due date to taxable periods beginning before January 1, 2026.
