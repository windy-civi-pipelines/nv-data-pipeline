AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the Department of
Taxation to deliver by electronic means notices, decisions and other
written communications under certain circumstances; revising the
manner in which the Department determines the industry in which a
business is engaged for the purposes of the commerce tax; revising the
due date for the payment of sales and use taxes; [authorizing certain
employees of the Department to electronically notarize electronic
documents created by the Department; authorizing the recording with a

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to deliver by electronic
2 means any notice, decision or other written communication that the Department is required to
3 provide to a person under existing law, unless: (1) the person has opted out of receiving such
4 notices, decisions or written communications by electronic means; or (2) another provision of
5 law specifies the means by which the Department is required to send such a notice, decision or
6 written communication. Under section 1, the electronic means by which the Department may
7 send notices, decisions and other written communications are: (1) delivery to a secure account
8 of a person who has registered for an account with an electronic system maintained by the
9 Department; (2) delivery to an electronic mail address at which a person has agreed to receive
10 notices, decisions and other written communications from the Department; and (3) posting a
11 notice, decision or other written communication on an electronic network or Internet website
12 maintained by the Department that is accessible to a person via the Internet or a mobile
13 application and delivering a separate notice of such posting to the electronic mail address of
14 the person. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill clarify that the Department is required to continue to
15 provide notice by personal service or by mail of determinations of deficiency in the payment
16 of taxes or the suspension or revocation of certain permits issued by the Department. (NRS

Assembly Amendment No. 832 to Assembly Bill No. 594 Page 4
18 Existing law imposes a commerce tax on the Nevada gross revenue of certain business
19 entities whose Nevada gross revenue exceeds $4,000,000 in a taxable year, at a rate that is
20 based on the industry in which a business entity is engaged. (Chapter 363C of NRS) Section
21 13 of this bill repeals the provision of existing law that provides that for the purpose of
22 determining the commerce tax rate of a business entity, the industry in which a business entity
23 is engaged is determined based on the 2012 edition of the North American Industry
24 Classification System (“NAICS”) published by the Bureau of the Census of the United States
25 Department of Commerce. (NRS 363C.060) Section 4 of this bill instead provides that the
26 industry in which a business entity is engaged is determined based on the most recent edition
27 of the NAICS. Section 5 of this bill updates certain NAICS codes in the publishing, software
28 and data processing business categories to reflect the 2022 version of the NAICS, which is the
29 most recent version published by the Bureau of the Census. (NRS 363C.430) Section 14 of
30 this bill provides that the changes made by sections 4, 5 and 13 apply only to taxable years
31 commencing on or after July 1, 2025, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the
32 changes made by those sections to previous taxable years.
33 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, a person required to pay sales or use tax is
34 required to remit such taxes to the Department on or before the last day of the month after the
35 tax was imposed. (NRS 372.355, 374.360) Sections 6 and 7 of this bill revise the due date for
36 remitting such taxes by requiring sales or use tax to be remitted to the Department on or
37 before the 20th day of the month after the tax was imposed. [Section] Sections 14 and 15
38 [provides] provide that the change to the due date for remitting sales and use taxes to the
39 Department applies [on] only to a taxable period beginning on or after [July 1, 2025,]
40 January 1, 2026, thereby prohibiting retroactive application of the change to such due date [.
41 Existing law establishes requirements for the filing with a county recorder of documents
42 creating an interest in real property or otherwise affecting real property, including, without
43 limitation, requirements for the document to contain the signature or electronic signature of
44 each person executing the document and to be notarized by a notary public or other notarial
45 officer. (NRS 111.010, 111.240, 111.265, 111.3685, 247.190) Under existing law, the
46 Department files with county recorders for recording certain documents, including, without
47 limitation, certificates creating liens on the real and personal property of a taxpayer for
48 delinquent taxes, fees, penalties and interest, and certificates releasing or subordinating such
49 liens. (NRS 360.473, 360.475) Section 8 of this bill establishes a manner in which such
50 electronic documents may be electronically notarized by an employee of the Department who
51 is a notary public and in good standing with the Secretary of State. Under sections 8 and 11 of
52 this bill, such an employee of the Department is authorized to electronically notarize the
53 electronic document without becoming registered as an electronic notary public under existing
54 law. (NRS 240.192) Section 9 of this bill makes the definitions in existing law governing the
55 electronic notarization of electronic documents applicable to section 8. Section 10 of this bill
56 makes the provisions of existing law governing the notarization of documents applicable to
57 the electronic notarization pursuant to section 8. Section 12 of this bill authorizes the
58 Department to file for recording with a county recorder a paper copy of the electronic
59 document containing the electronic signature of an employee of the Department and the
60 electronic notarization authorized by section 8.] to taxable periods beginning before
61 January 1, 2026.
