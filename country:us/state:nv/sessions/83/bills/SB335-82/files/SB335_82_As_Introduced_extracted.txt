EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; authorizing tenants subject to certain
actions for summary eviction to request that the court stay
the action until a decision concerning an application for
rental assistance is made and establishing procedures
relating thereto; requiring a landlord to accept payment of
rent from a tenant and rental assistance on behalf of a
tenant under certain circumstances; authorizing a justice
court to establish a diversion program for certain tenants
subject to an action for summary eviction; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law provides for a summary eviction procedure when a
2 tenant defaults in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253) Section 9 of this bill
3 authorizes a tenant who has been served with a notice to pay rent or surrender the
4 premises to request that the court stay an action for summary eviction based on a
5 default in the payment of rent until a decision concerning an application for rental
6 assistance is made. Section 9 establishes the procedure for a tenant to request such
7 a stay and criteria for the issuance of a stay. If the court issues such a stay, section
8 9: (1) authorizes a landlord to file a motion to lift the stay under certain
9 circumstances; and (2) requires that the stay expire not later than 60 days after it is
10 issued. If an application for rental assistance is granted in an amount that will allow
11 the tenant in an action that has been stayed to cure the default, section 9 requires
12 the landlord to accept payment of rent from the tenant and rental assistance on
13 behalf of the tenant. If the application for rental assistance is denied or granted in
14 an amount that will not allow the tenant in an action that has been stayed to cure the
15 default, section 9 requires the court to proceed with the action for summary
16 eviction in accordance with the requirements prescribed by existing law. Section
17 21.2 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the submission of an
18 affidavit pursuant to section 9. Section 9.1 of this bill creates a similar process that
-
*SB335_R3*
– 2 –
19 becomes effective if and only if Assembly Bill No. 340 of this session is enacted by
20 the Legislature and approved by the Governor.
21 In general, existing law provides for a summary eviction procedure when a
22 tenant neglects or fails to perform a condition or covenant of a lease or agreement.
23 (NRS 40.254) Section 9.7 of this bill requires a court to dismiss an action for
24 summary eviction based on neglect or failure to perform a condition or covenant of
25 a lease or agreement if the court finds that the affidavit of complaint for summary
26 eviction was filed by the landlord in bad faith or as a pretext for evicting a tenant
27 who is in default in the payment of rent. Section 21.4 of this bill creates a similar
28 requirement that becomes effective if and only if Assembly Bill No. 340 of this
29 session is not enacted by the Legislature and approved by the Governor.
30 Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes a justice court to establish a diversion
31 program to which it may assign an eligible tenant subject to an action for summary
32 eviction. Section 9.5 sets forth factors the court may consider in determining
33 whether a tenant is eligible for assignment to such a diversion program. If the court
34 assigns a tenant to such a diversion program, section 9.5 requires the court to: (1)
35 stay the pending action for summary eviction for not more than 60 days; and (2) if
36 the tenant pays the landlord the rent that is in default or surrenders the premises
37 before the expiration of the stay, dismiss the action.

32 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment,
33 mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by
34 the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent,
35 the landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice
36 in writing, requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the
37 surrender of the premises:
38 (a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
39 following the day of service; or
40 (b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
41 in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
42 less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or
43 before noon of the fourth full day following the day of service.
44  As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the

-
*SB335_R3*
– 8 –
1 tenant. If personal service was not so delivered, the “day of service”

3 pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service if the
4 request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by
5 the sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall

15 (b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the

19 evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took possession of
20 the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
21 tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
22 procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
23 acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
24 hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the

26 3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
27 (a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
28 (b) Advise the tenant:
29 (1) Of the tenant’s right to [contest] :
30 (I) Contest the matter by filing, within the time specified

33 matter stating that the tenant has tendered payment or is not in
34 default in the payment of the rent; or
35 (II) Request that the court stay any action for summary
36 eviction initiated by the landlord against the tenant using the
37 procedure prescribed by section 9 of this act;
38 (2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an
39 unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal
40 of the tenant or an order providing for the nonadmittance of the
41 tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the
42 order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24 hours
43 after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or

*SB335_R3*

1 (3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief
2 if a landlord unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or
3 excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s
4 entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or causes or permits
5 the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
6 agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
7 4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
8 stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
9 of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
10 provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
11 locking or otherwise.
12 5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
13 (a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
14 of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
15 which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
16 are located or to the district court of the county in which the
17 dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are
18 located, whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may
19 thereupon issue an order directing the sheriff or constable of the
20 county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not
21 later than 24 hours after the order is received by the sheriff or
22 constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not
23 earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of
24 the order. The affidavit must state or contain:
25 (1) The date the tenancy commenced.
26 (2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
27 (3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits
28 paid in advance, in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.

37 (b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit

39 received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
40 the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
41 or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
42 nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
43 6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
44 subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
45 affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
-
*SB335_R3*
– 10 –
1 subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
2 hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
3 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
4 provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
5 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
6 guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
7 for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
8 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
9 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
10 refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
11 provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
12 proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
13 inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
14 tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
15 other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
16 unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
17 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
18 thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
19 accordance with NRS 40.251.
20 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
21 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
22 court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the
23 amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
24 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
25 property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20
26 days after the summary order for removal of the tenant or the
27 abandonment of the premises by the tenant, or within 20 days after:
28 (a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises;
29 and
30 (b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided
31 to the tenant,
32  whichever is later.
33 8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
34 court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
35 held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
36 affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
37 upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
38 At the hearing, the court may:
39 (a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
40 to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
41 (b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
42 of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
43 to be due.
44 9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
45 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
-
*SB335_R3*
– 11 –
1 court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
2 reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
3 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
4 tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
5 filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
6 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
7 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
8 the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
9 by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
10 court may:
11 (a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s
12 essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
13 necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
14 (b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
15 10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be

29 perjury, stating such loss or destruction.
30 (b) The date when the tenancy or rental agreement allegedly
31 terminated.
32 (c) The date when written notice to surrender was given to the
33 tenant pursuant to the provisions of NRS 40.251, 40.2514 or

THIRD REPRINT S.B. 335
SENATE BILL NO. 335–SENATOR OHRENSCHALL
MARCH 20, 2023
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions regarding real property.
(BDR 3-883)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; authorizing tenants subject to certain
actions for summary eviction to request that the court stay
the action until a decision concerning an application for
rental assistance is made and establishing procedures
relating thereto; requiring a landlord to accept payment of
rent from a tenant and rental assistance on behalf of a
tenant under certain circumstances; authorizing a justice
court to establish a diversion program for certain tenants
subject to an action for summary eviction; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law provides for a summary eviction procedure when a
2 tenant defaults in the payment of rent. (NRS 40.253) Section 9 of this bill
3 authorizes a tenant who has been served with a notice to pay rent or surrender the
4 premises to request that the court stay an action for summary eviction based on a
5 default in the payment of rent until a decision concerning an application for rental
6 assistance is made. Section 9 establishes the procedure for a tenant to request such
7 a stay and criteria for the issuance of a stay. If the court issues such a stay, section
8 9: (1) authorizes a landlord to file a motion to lift the stay under certain
9 circumstances; and (2) requires that the stay expire not later than 60 days after it is
10 issued. If an application for rental assistance is granted in an amount that will allow
11 the tenant in an action that has been stayed to cure the default, section 9 requires
12 the landlord to accept payment of rent from the tenant and rental assistance on
13 behalf of the tenant. If the application for rental assistance is denied or granted in
14 an amount that will not allow the tenant in an action that has been stayed to cure the
15 default, section 9 requires the court to proceed with the action for summary
16 eviction in accordance with the requirements prescribed by existing law. Section
17 21.2 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the submission of an
18 affidavit pursuant to section 9. Section 9.1 of this bill creates a similar process that
-
*SB335_R3*

– 2 –
19 becomes effective if and only if Assembly Bill No. 340 of this session is enacted by
20 the Legislature and approved by the Governor.
21 In general, existing law provides for a summary eviction procedure when a
22 tenant neglects or fails to perform a condition or covenant of a lease or agreement.
23 (NRS 40.254) Section 9.7 of this bill requires a court to dismiss an action for
24 summary eviction based on neglect or failure to perform a condition or covenant of
25 a lease or agreement if the court finds that the affidavit of complaint for summary
26 eviction was filed by the landlord in bad faith or as a pretext for evicting a tenant
27 who is in default in the payment of rent. Section 21.4 of this bill creates a similar
28 requirement that becomes effective if and only if Assembly Bill No. 340 of this
29 session is not enacted by the Legislature and approved by the Governor.
30 Section 9.5 of this bill authorizes a justice court to establish a diversion
31 program to which it may assign an eligible tenant subject to an action for summary
32 eviction. Section 9.5 sets forth factors the court may consider in determining
33 whether a tenant is eligible for assignment to such a diversion program. If the court
34 assigns a tenant to such a diversion program, section 9.5 requires the court to: (1)
35 stay the pending action for summary eviction for not more than 60 days; and (2) if
36 the tenant pays the landlord the rent that is in default or surrenders the premises
37 before the expiration of the stay, dismiss the action.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

21 (2) The landlord has missed three or more consecutive
22 mortgage payments;
23 (b) The application for rental assistance was submitted in bad
24 faith; or
25 (c) It is unlikely that:
26 (1) The application for rental assistance will be granted; or
27 (2) The tenant will be able to cure the default in the
28 payment of rent, regardless of whether the application for rental

32 damages from the tenant.

29 Sec. 21.2. NRS 40.253 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 40.253 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in
31 addition to the remedy provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to
32 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment,
33 mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by
34 the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent,
35 the landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice
36 in writing, requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the
37 surrender of the premises:
38 (a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
39 following the day of service; or
40 (b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
41 in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
42 less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or
43 before noon of the fourth full day following the day of service.
44  As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the
45 landlord or the landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the
-
*SB335_R3*

– 8 –
1 tenant. If personal service was not so delivered, the “day of service”
2 means the day the notice is delivered, after posting and mailing
3 pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service if the
4 request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by
5 the sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall
6 be deemed to be the day next following the day that the request is
7 made for service by the sheriff or constable.
8 2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a
9 tenant pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 shall attempt to
10 deliver the notice in person in the manner set forth in subsection 2 of
11 NRS 40.2542. If the notice cannot be delivered in person, the
12 landlord or the landlord’s agent:
13 (a) Shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the
14 premises and mail the notice by overnight mail; and
15 (b) After the notice has been posted and mailed, may deliver the
16 notice to the sheriff or constable for service in the manner set forth
17 in subsection 1 of NRS 40.280. The sheriff or constable shall not
18 accept the notice for service unless it is accompanied by written
19 evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took possession of
20 the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
21 tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
22 procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
23 acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
24 hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the
25 landlord’s agent.
26 3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
27 (a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
28 (b) Advise the tenant:
29 (1) Of the tenant’s right to [contest] :
30 (I) Contest the matter by filing, within the time specified
31 in subsection 1 for the payment of the rent or surrender of the
32 premises, an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the
33 matter stating that the tenant has tendered payment or is not in
34 default in the payment of the rent; or
35 (II) Request that the court stay any action for summary
36 eviction initiated by the landlord against the tenant using the
37 procedure prescribed by section 9 of this act;
38 (2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an
39 unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal
40 of the tenant or an order providing for the nonadmittance of the
41 tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the
42 order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24 hours
43 after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or
44 constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not
45 later than 36 hours after the posting of the order; and
-
*SB335_R3*

– 9 –
1 (3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief
2 if a landlord unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or
3 excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s
4 entry upon the premises or willfully interrupts or causes or permits
5 the interruption of an essential service required by the rental
6 agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
7 4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
8 stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
9 of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
10 provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
11 locking or otherwise.
12 5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
13 (a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
14 of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
15 which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
16 are located or to the district court of the county in which the
17 dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are
18 located, whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may
19 thereupon issue an order directing the sheriff or constable of the
20 county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not
21 later than 24 hours after the order is received by the sheriff or
22 constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not
23 earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of
24 the order. The affidavit must state or contain:
25 (1) The date the tenancy commenced.
26 (2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
27 (3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits
28 paid in advance, in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
29 (4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
30 (5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession
31 without paying rent.
32 (6) The amount of rent claimed due and delinquent.
33 (7) A statement that the written notice was served on the
34 tenant in accordance with NRS 40.280.
35 (8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.
36 (9) A copy of the signed written rental agreement, if any.
37 (b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit
38 described in subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been
39 received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
40 the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
41 or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
42 nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
43 6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
44 subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
45 affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
-
*SB335_R3*

– 10 –
1 subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
2 hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
3 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
4 provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
5 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
6 guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
7 for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
8 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
9 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
10 refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
11 provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
12 proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
13 inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
14 tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
15 other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
16 unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
17 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
18 thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
19 accordance with NRS 40.251.
20 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
21 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
22 court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the
23 amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
24 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
25 property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20
26 days after the summary order for removal of the tenant or the
27 abandonment of the premises by the tenant, or within 20 days after:
28 (a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises;
29 and
30 (b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided
31 to the tenant,
32  whichever is later.
33 8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
34 court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
35 held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
36 affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
37 upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
38 At the hearing, the court may:
39 (a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
40 to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
41 (b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
42 of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
43 to be due.
44 9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
45 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
-
*SB335_R3*

– 11 –
1 court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
2 reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
3 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
4 tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
5 filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
6 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
7 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
8 the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
9 by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
10 court may:
11 (a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s
12 essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
13 necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
14 (b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
15 10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
16 awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall
17 consider:
18 (a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
19 (b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant;
20 and
21 (c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s
22 conduct.
23 11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that
24 is submitted after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or
25 had served a notice pursuant to subsection 1 if the refusal is based
26 on the fact that the tenant has not paid collection fees, attorney’s
27 fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable charge for late
28 payments of rent or dishonored checks, or a security deposit. As
29 used in this subsection, “security deposit” has the meaning ascribed
30 to it in NRS 118A.240.
31 12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this
32 section does not apply to:
33 (a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to
34 the tenant of a recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home
35 park in this State other than an area designated as a recreational
36 vehicle lot pursuant to the provisions of subsection 8 of
37 NRS 40.215.
38 (b) A tenant who provides proof to the landlord that he or she is
39 a federal worker, tribal worker, state worker or household member
40 of such a worker during a shutdown.
41 13. As used in this section, “close of business” means the close
42 of business of the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.
43 Sec. 21.4. NRS 40.254 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 40.254 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, in
45 addition to the remedy provided in NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive,
-
*SB335_R3*

– 12 –
1 when the tenant of a dwelling unit, part of a low-rent housing
2 program operated by a public housing authority, a mobile home or a
3 recreational vehicle is guilty of an unlawful detainer pursuant to
4 NRS 40.250, 40.251, 40.2514 or 40.2516, the landlord or the
5 landlord’s agent may utilize the summary procedures for eviction as
6 provided in NRS 40.253 except that written notice to surrender the
7 premises must:
8 (a) Be given to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of
9 NRS 40.280;
10 (b) Advise the tenant of the court that has jurisdiction over the
11 matter; and
12 (c) Advise the tenant of the tenant’s right to:
13 (1) Contest the notice by filing before the court’s close of
14 business on the fifth judicial day after the day of service of the
15 notice an affidavit with the court that has jurisdiction over the matter
16 stating the reasons why the tenant is not guilty of an unlawful
17 detainer; or
18 (2) Request that the court stay the execution of the order for
19 removal of the tenant or order providing for nonadmittance of the
20 tenant for a period not exceeding 10 days pursuant to subsection 2
21 of NRS 70.010, stating the reasons why such a stay is warranted.
22 2. The affidavit of the landlord or the landlord’s agent
23 submitted to the justice court or the district court must state or
24 contain:
25 (a) The date when the tenancy commenced, the term of the
26 tenancy and, if any, a copy of the rental agreement. If the rental
27 agreement has been lost or destroyed, the landlord or the landlord’s
28 agent may attach an affidavit or declaration, signed under penalty of
29 perjury, stating such loss or destruction.
30 (b) The date when the tenancy or rental agreement allegedly
31 terminated.
32 (c) The date when written notice to surrender was given to the
33 tenant pursuant to the provisions of NRS 40.251, 40.2514 or
34 40.2516, together with any facts supporting the notice.
35 (d) The date when the written notice was given, a copy of the
36 notice and a statement that notice was served in accordance with
37 NRS 40.280 and, if applicable, a copy of the notice of change of
38 ownership served on the tenant pursuant to NRS 40.255 if the
39 property has been purchased as a residential foreclosure.
40 (e) A statement that the claim for relief was authorized by law.
41 3. If the court finds that the affidavit of the landlord or the
42 landlord’s agent was submitted in bad faith or as a pretext for
43 evicting a tenant who is in default in the payment of rent, the court
44 must dismiss the proceeding.

4 be awarded any reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the landlord
