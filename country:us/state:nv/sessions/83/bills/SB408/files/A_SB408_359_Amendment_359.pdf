Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a county or group of counties to establish a public hospital. (NRS
2 450.020) Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish a county
3 hospital district to operate a district hospital or otherwise provide the services of a hospital to
4 the residents of this State. (NRS 450.590, 450.610, 450.630, 450.710) Existing law authorizes
5 the governing body of a county hospital [or a county hospital district] to: (1) employ
6 physicians, interns and dentists, on a full-time or part-time basis, and fix their compensations;
7 and (2) control the admission of such physicians and interns to the staff of the hospital by
8 promulgating appropriate rules, regulations and standards governing those appointments.
9 (NRS [450.180, 450.640)] 450.180) Existing law similarly authorizes the governing body
10 of a county hospital district to take such actions with regard to physicians and interns.
11 (NRS 450.640) Existing law further authorizes the governing body of a county hospital to
12 institute and maintain training programs in the county hospital for resident physicians, interns
13 and postgraduates that meet certain accreditation standards. (NRS 450.455) Section 3 of this
14 bill additionally authorizes the governing body of a county hospital district to employ
15 and fix the compensation of dentists. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill remove interns from the
16 list of persons that the governing body of a county hospital or county hospital district may
17 employ, and instead, authorizes such a governing body to employ and control the admission of
18 medical and dental residents and fellows . [and fix their compensation.] Section 2 of this bill
19 makes a conforming change to authorize a county hospital to institute and maintain training
20 programs for fellows in addition to resident physicians. Section 2 also updates the name of an
21 accrediting organization for medical residencies.
22 Existing law authorizes a county or district hospital to enter into a contract to provide
23 certain services in connection with or related to the operation of certain hospitals or necessary
24 for the health and welfare of the general public. (NRS 450.800) Section 4 of this bill specifies
25 that such services include certain mental or behavioral health services performed in
26 connection with or related to a crisis stabilization center, which is a hospital with an

Senate Amendment No. 359 to Senate Bill No. 408 Page 4
27 endorsement to provide such services. (NRS 449.0915) Section 4 also authorizes a county or
28 district hospital to form a separate organization to provide or contract for the provision of
29 certain services.
