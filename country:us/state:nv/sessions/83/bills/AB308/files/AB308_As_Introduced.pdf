AN ACT relating to cannabis; authorizing the Cannabis Compliance
Board, in accordance with policies and procedures
established by the Board, to waive any requirement to
obtain a registration card for a person who holds an
ownership interest of 5 percent or more in a cannabis
establishment; clarifying the procedures by which an
owner, officer or board member of a cannabis
establishment may obtain a registration card; revising
provisions governing the renewal of registration cards;
revising requirements setting forth the cannabis
establishments at which the holder of a registration card
may serve as an owner, officer or board member or
volunteer or work; increasing the fee for the issuance or
renewal of certain registration cards; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the issuance of cannabis establishment agent
2 registration cards, cannabis establishment agent registration cards for cannabis
3 executives and cannabis establishment agent registration cards for cannabis
4 receivers by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (NRS 678B.340, 678B.350,
5 678B.355) Existing law defines “cannabis establishment agent” to mean an owner,
6 officer, board member, employee or volunteer of a cannabis establishment, an
7 independent contractor who provides labor relating to the cultivation or processing
8 of cannabis or the production of usable cannabis or cannabis products for a
9 cannabis establishment or an employee of such an independent contractor. (NRS
10 678A.100) Existing law defines “cannabis establishment agent registration card” to
11 mean a registration card that is issued by the Board to authorize a person: (1) to be
12 an owner, officer or board member of a cannabis establishment; or (2) to volunteer
-

– 2 –
13 or work at or contract to provide labor for a cannabis establishment. (NRS
14 678A.105) Section 2 of this bill clarifies the procedures by which a cannabis
15 establishment agent registration card may be issued to an owner, officer or board
16 member of a cannabis establishment.
17 Existing law requires a person who holds an ownership interest in a cannabis
18 establishment of 5 percent or more to obtain a cannabis establishment agent
19 registration card for a cannabis executive. (NRS 678B.350) Section 1 of this bill
20 authorizes the Board, in accordance with policies and procedures established by the
21 Board by regulation, to waive any requirement to obtain a registration card for any
22 person who holds an ownership interest of 5 percent or more in a cannabis
23 establishment.
24 Existing law provides that a cannabis establishment agent registration card,
25 cannabis establishment agent registration card for a cannabis executive and
26 cannabis establishment agent registration card for a cannabis receiver expires 2
27 years after issuance and may be renewed upon the submission to the Board of
28 certain information and the payment of a renewal fee. (NRS 678B.340, 678B.350,
29 678B.355) Sections 2-4 of this bill revise the date on which such a registration card
30 expires. Under sections 2-4, the initial registration card expires 2 years after
31 issuance and any renewed registration card expires 2 years after the expiration date
32 of the most recent registration card issued to or renewed by the person. Sections 2-
33 4 additionally require, in order to renew a registration card, the required
34 information and payment to be submitted on or before the date on which the
35 registration card expires.
36 Sections 2-4 also eliminate provisions requiring a person to whom a
37 registration card is issued or for whom a registration card is renewed to submit to
38 the Board an affidavit on the first anniversary of the issuance or renewal attesting to
39 certain matters.
40 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing different
41 categories of cannabis establishment agent registration cards. (NRS 678B.650)
42 Under existing law, a cannabis establishment agent registration card authorizes the
43 person to whom it is issued to volunteer or work at any cannabis establishment in
44 this State for which the category of the registration card authorizes the person to
45 volunteer or work. (NRS 678B.340) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the
46 requirement that the Board establish categories of cannabis establishment agent
47 registration cards. Section 2 instead establishes two categories of cannabis
48 establishment registration cards to be issued to a person who wishes to serve as an
49 owner, officer or board member of or volunteer or work at a cannabis
50 establishment. Under section 2, a cannabis establishment agent registration card
51 issued to a person who wishes to serve as an owner, officer or board member of or
52 volunteer or work at: (1) a cannabis establishment other than a cannabis
53 independent testing laboratory authorizes the person to serve as an owner, officer or
54 board member of or volunteer or work at any cannabis establishment in this State
55 other than a cannabis independent testing laboratory; and (2) a cannabis
56 independent testing laboratory authorizes the person to serve as an owner, officer or
57 board member of or volunteer or work at any cannabis independent testing
58 laboratory in this State.
59 Existing law establishes a fee of $150 for the initial issuance and renewal of a
60 cannabis establishment agent registration card. (NRS 678B.390) Section 5 of this
61 bill increases that fee to $400 for the initial issuance and renewal of: (1) a cannabis
62 establishment agent registration card to an owner, officer or board member of a
63 cannabis establishment; (2) a cannabis establishment agent registration card for
64 a cannabis executive; and (3) a cannabis establishment agent registration card for a
65 cannabis receiver.
