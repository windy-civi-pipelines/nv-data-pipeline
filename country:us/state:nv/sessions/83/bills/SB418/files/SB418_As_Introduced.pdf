AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Retirement System;
revising provisions relating to the collection of delinquent
contributions by the System; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a system of retirement that provides benefits for the
2 retirement, disability or death of employees of public employers in Nevada known as
3 the Public Employees’ Retirement System. (NRS 286.110) Under existing law, public
4 employers are required to periodically file payroll reports and remit contributions to
5 the System with respect to their employees. (NRS 286.460) Existing law provides that
6 if a public employer is delinquent by more than 90 days in submitting a payroll report
7 or remitting contributions, the System is required to submit a written complaint to the
8 Department of Taxation asking the Department to take necessary actions to collect the
9 delinquent amount in accordance with the procedure in existing law for delinquent
10 reports of local governments, which includes the withholding of certain payments to
11 which a local government may otherwise be entitled. (NRS 286.462, 354.665)
12 Existing law also provides a procedure for the withholding of certain payments to
13 which a local government may otherwise be entitled for failing to make certain
14 payments to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 354.671) Section 1 of
15 this bill changes the procedure by which the System is required to collect delinquent
16 contributions by specifying: (1) the entity that is required to be notified regarding
17 delinquent contributions for each type of public employer, including the Department
18 of Taxation in existing law for local governments; and (2) the source of payment for
19 those delinquent contributions for each type of public employer, including the
20 withholding of certain payments to local governments in existing law. Section 1 also
21 removes the applicability of the procedure to delinquent payroll reports. Sections 2-4
22 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the revised procedure in section 1.
