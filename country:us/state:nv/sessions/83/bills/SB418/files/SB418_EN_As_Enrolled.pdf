Senate Bill No. 418–Committee on Finance
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Retirement System;
revising provisions relating to the collection of delinquent
contributions by the System; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes a system of retirement that provides benefits for the
retirement, disability or death of employees of public employers in Nevada known as
the Public Employees’ Retirement System. (NRS 286.110) Under existing law, public
employers are required to periodically file payroll reports and remit contributions to
the System with respect to their employees. (NRS 286.460) Existing law provides that
if a public employer is delinquent by more than 90 days in submitting a payroll report
or remitting contributions, the System is required to submit a written complaint to the
Department of Taxation asking the Department to take necessary actions to collect the
delinquent amount in accordance with the procedure in existing law for delinquent
reports of local governments, which includes the withholding of certain payments to
which a local government may otherwise be entitled. (NRS 286.462, 354.665)
Existing law also provides a procedure for the withholding of certain payments to
which a local government may otherwise be entitled for failing to make certain
payments to the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 354.671) Section 1 of
this bill changes the procedure by which the System is required to collect delinquent
contributions by specifying: (1) the entity that is required to be notified regarding
delinquent contributions for each type of public employer, including the Department
of Taxation in existing law for local governments; and (2) the source of payment for
those delinquent contributions for each type of public employer, including the
withholding of certain payments to local governments in existing law. Section 1 also
removes the applicability of the procedure to delinquent payroll reports. Sections 2-4
of this bill make conforming changes relating to the revised procedure in section 1.
