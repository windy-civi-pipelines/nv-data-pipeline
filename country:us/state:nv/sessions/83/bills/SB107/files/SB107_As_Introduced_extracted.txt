3 The Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct hearings concerning acts
4 of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and public accommodations.
5 (NRS 233.150) Existing law sets forth the Nevada Fair Housing Law to prohibit
6 discrimination in housing. (NRS 118.010-118.120) In addition, the federal Fair
7 Housing Act of 1968, as amended, prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental and
8 financing of dwellings and in other housing-related transactions. (42 U.S.C. §§
9 3601 et seq.)

10 Sections 15, 18 and 19 of this bill revise references to the types of
11 discrimination from which persons are protected in Nevada to conform to federal
12 law.
13 Section 19 authorizes the Commission to initiate a complaint alleging an
14 unlawful discriminatory practice in housing. Section 21 of this bill requires the
15 Commission to investigate each complaint which alleges an unlawful
16 discriminatory practice in housing and to attempt to resolve the issues raised in the
17 complaint through informal negotiations with the parties. Section 22 of this bill
18 requires the Commission to serve upon a complainant certain information.
19 Section 12 of this bill establishes new procedures and requirements with
20 respect to investigations and administrative hearings concerning such complaints.
21 Following the Commission’s investigation of a complaint, if the Administrator of
22 the Commission determines that probable cause exists to believe that an unlawful
23 discriminatory practice in housing has occurred or is about to occur, section 12
24 requires the Attorney General to: (1) prepare a notice of hearing and serve the
25 notice upon the parties; and (2) unless a party elects to have the matter determined
26 by a court, prepare and prosecute the complaint in a public hearing before the
27 Commission. If the Commission, based on a preponderance of the evidence,
28 determines that an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing has occurred,
29 section 12 authorizes the Commission to issue an order to cease and desist, order
30 appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief, award actual damages, impose civil
31 penalties and award costs and attorney’s fees. Section 26 of this bill makes a
32 conforming change to eliminate a requirement for the Commission to hold an
33 informal meeting of the parties.
34 Section 13 of this bill provides for the determination of a complaint by a court
35 instead of the Commission. Section 14 of this bill establishes procedures for the
36 judicial review of a final decision of the Commission.
37 Sections 2-11 and 16 of this bill move definitions in existing law relating to the
38 Commission and define various terms relating to the complaint process. Sections
39 22-24, 26 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes to existing law to
40 incorporate those terms. Section 25 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer
41 to a provision that has been renumbered in section 24.
42 Existing law prohibits the Commission from entering into certain agreements
43 with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for the
44 Commission to investigate and enforce laws relating to fair housing as a certified
45 agency under federal law unless the Legislature expressly authorizes the
46 Commission to do so. (NRS 233.153) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
47 Commission to enter into such an agreement without legislative approval.
48 Section 28 of this bill provides that the provisions of existing law relating to
49 the judicial review of decisions of the Commission concerning unlawful
50 discriminatory practice in housing prevail over the provisions of the Nevada
51 Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233 of NRS)
52 Section 32 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person seeking to
53 rent or lease a dwelling, or renting or leasing a dwelling, from: (1) refusing to rent
54 or lease, or refusing to negotiate to rent or lease, a dwelling to an applicant on the
55 basis of the applicant’s arrest record; (2) making, printing or publishing any notice,
56 statement or advertisement relating to the rental or lease which indicates a
57 preference based on the arrest record of an applicant; and (3) evicting a tenant from
58 a dwelling on the basis of his or her arrest record. Section 32 also requires a person
59 who makes a dwelling available for rent or lease to provide each applicant with
60 information on how to file an appeal of a denial to rent or lease or file a complaint
61 with the Commission. Section 32 limits the applicability of these provisions to any
62 dwelling unit that is owned by a natural person and contains five or more dwelling
63 units. For purposes of section 32, a “dwelling” is defined, with certain exceptions,
64 as: (1) public housing; (2) any housing that is rented or leased to a tenant pursuant
-
*SB107*
– 3 –
65 to a contract with a housing authority; or (3) any housing which accepts vouchers
66 for rental payment. A “dwelling” does not include: (1) a manufactured home; or (2)
67 a single-family house owned by a natural person or any other housing that is owned
68 by a natural person and has four or fewer dwelling units.
69 Section 33 of this bill prohibits a person seeking to rent or lease a dwelling, or
70 renting or leasing a dwelling from: (1) requiring a guarantor on a contract to rent or
71 lease a dwelling to provide proof of income in an amount greater than two times the
72 monthly rent or lease; (2) refusing to rent or lease or refusing to negotiate to rent or
73 lease a dwelling to an applicant because a guarantor has not provided proof of
74 income in an amount greater than two times the monthly rent or lease; or (3)
75 making, printing or publishing any notice, statement or advertisement relating to
76 the rental or lease of a dwelling which indicates a requirement for a guarantor to
77 provide proof of income in an amount greater than two times the monthly rent.
78 Sections 34-45 of this bill amend the Nevada Fair Housing Law to conform to
79 federal law. Section 36 revises the definition of “disability” to exclude any current
80 illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance. Sections 37 and 38 revise the
81 definitions of “dwelling” and “person,” respectively. Sections 30 and 31 of this bill
82 define the terms “aggrieved person” and “unlawful discriminatory practice in
83 housing,” respectively.
84 Section 39 revises the prohibited practices which constitute an unlawful
85 discriminatory practice in housing in Nevada. Section 39 prohibits discrimination
86 in real estate-related transactions. Section 39 also sets forth certain exceptions to
87 the application of its provisions.
88 Section 40 prohibits a person from refusing to: (1) allow a person with a
89 disability to make reasonable modifications to a dwelling which may be necessary
90 to afford the person with a disability full enjoyment of the dwelling, if the person
91 with a disability pays for the modifications; or (2) make reasonable
92 accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services which may be necessary to
93 afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling.
94 Section 41 revises accessibility requirements relating to the design and
95 construction of a covered multifamily dwelling. Section 42 revises provisions
96 prohibiting a landlord from refusing to rent a dwelling to a person with a disability
97 with a service animal.
98 Sections 43-45 revise provisions governing civil actions to enforce certain
99 provisions relating to discrimination in housing.
100 The Residential Landlord and Tenant Act sets forth certain rights and
101 obligations of a landlord and tenant for certain residential tenancies in this State.
102 (Chapter 118A of NRS) Section 46 of this bill adds to the Act a provision requiring
103 a landlord to provide an itemized statement to a tenant if the tenant pays the
104 landlord for any utility service.

3 The Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct hearings concerning acts
4 of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and public accommodations.
5 (NRS 233.150) Existing law sets forth the Nevada Fair Housing Law to prohibit
6 discrimination in housing. (NRS 118.010-118.120) In addition, the federal Fair

10 Sections 15, 18 and 19 of this bill revise references to the types of
11 discrimination from which persons are protected in Nevada to conform to federal
12 law.
13 Section 19 authorizes the Commission to initiate a complaint alleging an
14 unlawful discriminatory practice in housing. Section 21 of this bill requires the
15 Commission to investigate each complaint which alleges an unlawful
16 discriminatory practice in housing and to attempt to resolve the issues raised in the
17 complaint through informal negotiations with the parties. Section 22 of this bill
18 requires the Commission to serve upon a complainant certain information.
19 Section 12 of this bill establishes new procedures and requirements with
20 respect to investigations and administrative hearings concerning such complaints.
21 Following the Commission’s investigation of a complaint, if the Administrator of
22 the Commission determines that probable cause exists to believe that an unlawful
23 discriminatory practice in housing has occurred or is about to occur, section 12
24 requires the Attorney General to: (1) prepare a notice of hearing and serve the
25 notice upon the parties; and (2) unless a party elects to have the matter determined
26 by a court, prepare and prosecute the complaint in a public hearing before the
27 Commission. If the Commission, based on a preponderance of the evidence,
28 determines that an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing has occurred,
29 section 12 authorizes the Commission to issue an order to cease and desist, order
30 appropriate injunctive or other equitable relief, award actual damages, impose civil
31 penalties and award costs and attorney’s fees. Section 26 of this bill makes a
32 conforming change to eliminate a requirement for the Commission to hold an
33 informal meeting of the parties.
34 Section 13 of this bill provides for the determination of a complaint by a court
35 instead of the Commission. Section 14 of this bill establishes procedures for the
36 judicial review of a final decision of the Commission.

40 incorporate those terms. Section 25 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer

42 Existing law prohibits the Commission from entering into certain agreements
43 with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for the
44 Commission to investigate and enforce laws relating to fair housing as a certified
45 agency under federal law unless the Legislature expressly authorizes the
46 Commission to do so. (NRS 233.153) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
47 Commission to enter into such an agreement without legislative approval.
48 Section 28 of this bill provides that the provisions of existing law relating to
49 the judicial review of decisions of the Commission concerning unlawful
50 discriminatory practice in housing prevail over the provisions of the Nevada
51 Administrative Procedure Act. (Chapter 233 of NRS)
52 Section 32 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a person seeking to
53 rent or lease a dwelling, or renting or leasing a dwelling, from: (1) refusing to rent
54 or lease, or refusing to negotiate to rent or lease, a dwelling to an applicant on the
55 basis of the applicant’s arrest record; (2) making, printing or publishing any notice,
56 statement or advertisement relating to the rental or lease which indicates a
57 preference based on the arrest record of an applicant; and (3) evicting a tenant from
58 a dwelling on the basis of his or her arrest record. Section 32 also requires a person
59 who makes a dwelling available for rent or lease to provide each applicant with
60 information on how to file an appeal of a denial to rent or lease or file a complaint
61 with the Commission. Section 32 limits the applicability of these provisions to any
62 dwelling unit that is owned by a natural person and contains five or more dwelling
63 units. For purposes of section 32, a “dwelling” is defined, with certain exceptions,
64 as: (1) public housing; (2) any housing that is rented or leased to a tenant pursuant
-
*SB107*

– 3 –
65 to a contract with a housing authority; or (3) any housing which accepts vouchers
66 for rental payment. A “dwelling” does not include: (1) a manufactured home; or (2)
67 a single-family house owned by a natural person or any other housing that is owned
68 by a natural person and has four or fewer dwelling units.
69 Section 33 of this bill prohibits a person seeking to rent or lease a dwelling, or
70 renting or leasing a dwelling from: (1) requiring a guarantor on a contract to rent or
71 lease a dwelling to provide proof of income in an amount greater than two times the
72 monthly rent or lease; (2) refusing to rent or lease or refusing to negotiate to rent or
73 lease a dwelling to an applicant because a guarantor has not provided proof of
74 income in an amount greater than two times the monthly rent or lease; or (3)
75 making, printing or publishing any notice, statement or advertisement relating to
76 the rental or lease of a dwelling which indicates a requirement for a guarantor to
77 provide proof of income in an amount greater than two times the monthly rent.
78 Sections 34-45 of this bill amend the Nevada Fair Housing Law to conform to
79 federal law. Section 36 revises the definition of “disability” to exclude any current
80 illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance. Sections 37 and 38 revise the
81 definitions of “dwelling” and “person,” respectively. Sections 30 and 31 of this bill
82 define the terms “aggrieved person” and “unlawful discriminatory practice in
83 housing,” respectively.
84 Section 39 revises the prohibited practices which constitute an unlawful
85 discriminatory practice in housing in Nevada. Section 39 prohibits discrimination
86 in real estate-related transactions. Section 39 also sets forth certain exceptions to
87 the application of its provisions.
88 Section 40 prohibits a person from refusing to: (1) allow a person with a
89 disability to make reasonable modifications to a dwelling which may be necessary
90 to afford the person with a disability full enjoyment of the dwelling, if the person
91 with a disability pays for the modifications; or (2) make reasonable
92 accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services which may be necessary to
93 afford a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling.
94 Section 41 revises accessibility requirements relating to the design and
95 construction of a covered multifamily dwelling. Section 42 revises provisions
96 prohibiting a landlord from refusing to rent a dwelling to a person with a disability
97 with a service animal.
98 Sections 43-45 revise provisions governing civil actions to enforce certain
99 provisions relating to discrimination in housing.
100 The Residential Landlord and Tenant Act sets forth certain rights and
101 obligations of a landlord and tenant for certain residential tenancies in this State.
102 (Chapter 118A of NRS) Section 46 of this bill adds to the Act a provision requiring
103 a landlord to provide an itemized statement to a tenant if the tenant pays the
104 landlord for any utility service.
