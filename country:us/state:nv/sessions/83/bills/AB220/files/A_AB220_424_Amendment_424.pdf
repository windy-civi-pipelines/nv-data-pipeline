AN ACT relating to identification cards; authorizing the Department of Health and

prohibiting certain conduct related to an identification card;
authorizing certain local governments to accept an identification card

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue
2 identification cards to: (1) qualified residents of this State who are 10 years of age or older
3 and do not hold a valid driver’s license or identification card from any state or jurisdiction;
4 and (2) qualified seasonal residents who do not hold a valid Nevada driver’s license. (NRS
5 483.820, 483.830) Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
6 establish the Nevada Housing Crisis Response System and requires the System to collaborate
7 with the Department of Motor Vehicles to facilitate assistance to persons experiencing
8 homelessness who wish to apply for an identification card issued by the Department of Motor
9 Vehicles. (NRS 422A.680)
10 Section 7 of this bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to
11 establish and administer a program to issue identification cards to residents of this State who
12 are experiencing homelessness. Section 7 limits the issuance of such cards to residents of this
13 State who are 10 years of age or older and do not hold a valid driver’s license or identification
14 card from any state or jurisdiction. Section 7: (1) prohibits the Department from charging a
15 fee for the issuance, renewal or replacement of an identification card; and (2) authorizes the
16 Department to accept gifts, grants and donations of money to fund the program to provide
17 identification cards to residents of this State who are experiencing homelessness. Sections 7

28 and age to the Department by presenting an original or certified copy of the documents
29 required by the Department of Motor Vehicles as proof of the full legal name and age of an
30 applicant for an identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 10
31 prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from issuing an identification card to

41 Section 12 of this bill applies to the Department the prohibition of existing law against
42 the issuance of an identification card to or renewal of the identification card of a sex offender
43 or an offender convicted of a crime against a child until the Department receives information
44 submitted by the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History or other
45 satisfactory evidence that the offender is in compliance with the provisions of law governing
46 the registration of sex offenders and offenders convicted of a crime against a child. (NRS
47 179D.570) Section 12 provides that an identification card issued to such offenders expires on
48 the first anniversary date of the offender’s birthday, measured from the birthday nearest to the
49 date of issuance or renewal of the card. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Central
50 Repository to share information concerning sex offenders and offenders convicted of a crime
51 against a child with the Department to carry out the provisions of section 12.
52 Section 13 of this bill provides that an identification card issued by the Department
53 generally remains valid until expiration unless the holder becomes licensed in any state or
54 jurisdiction to drive a motor vehicle or obtains an identification card from any state or
55 jurisdiction. Section 13 requires an identification card issued by the Department to be
56 surrendered upon the issuance of a driver’s license from any state or jurisdiction, an
57 identification card from another state or jurisdiction or an identification card issued by the
58 Department of Motor Vehicles.
59 Section 14 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations prescribing when an
60 identification card expires and requires the date of expiration adopted by the Department to be
61 not later than the eighth anniversary of the birthday of the holder of the identification card
62 measured from the birthday nearest to the date of issuance or renewal of the card.

64 obtain a duplicate card.
65 Section 16 of this bill provides that a person who commits certain acts relating to an
66 identification card is guilty of a misdemeanor.
67 Section 18 of this bill authorizes certain local governments to accept an identification
68 card issued by the Department of Health and Human Services for certain purposes.
69 Sections 2-6 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of sections 2-16.

33 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
34 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
35 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

42 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

44 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
45 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
46 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
47 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
48 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
49 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
50 record that is not otherwise confidential.
51 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
52 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

Assembly Amendment No. 424 to Assembly Bill No. 220 Page 12
1 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
2 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
3 (a) The public record:
4 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
5 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
6 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
7 electronic medium would:
8 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
9 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
10 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
11 otherwise confidential.
12 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
13 custody or control of a public record:
14 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
15 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
16 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
17 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
18 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
19 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

22 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
23 out the provisions of this act; and
24 2. On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
