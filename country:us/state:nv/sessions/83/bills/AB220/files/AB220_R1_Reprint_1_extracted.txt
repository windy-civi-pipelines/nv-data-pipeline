15 711.600, and section 7 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter
16 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes
17 of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
18 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
19 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
20 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
21 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
22 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
23 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
24 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
25 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
26 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
27 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
28 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
29 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
30 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
31 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
32 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
33 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
34 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
35 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
36 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
37 electronically, the confidential information from the information
38 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
39 confidential.
40 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
41 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
42 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
43 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
44 means of an electronic medium if:
45 (a) The public record:
-
*AB220_R1*
– 13 –
1 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
2 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
3 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
4 means of an electronic medium would:
5 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
6 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
7 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
8 information that is not otherwise confidential.
9 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
10 has legal custody or control of a public record:
11 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
12 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
13 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
14 medium.
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
16 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
17 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
18 or herself.
19 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective:
20 1. Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
21 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
22 tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and
23 2. On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.

15 711.600, and section 7 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter
16 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes
17 of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
18 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
19 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
20 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
21 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
22 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
23 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
24 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
25 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
26 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
27 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
28 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
29 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
30 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
31 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
32 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
33 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
34 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
35 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
36 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
37 electronically, the confidential information from the information
38 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
39 confidential.
40 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
41 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
42 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
43 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
44 means of an electronic medium if:
45 (a) The public record:
-
*AB220_R1*

– 13 –
1 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
2 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
3 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
4 means of an electronic medium would:
5 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
6 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
7 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
8 information that is not otherwise confidential.
9 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
10 has legal custody or control of a public record:
11 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
12 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
13 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
14 medium.
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
16 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
17 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
18 or herself.
19 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective:
20 1. Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
21 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
22 tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and
23 2. On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
