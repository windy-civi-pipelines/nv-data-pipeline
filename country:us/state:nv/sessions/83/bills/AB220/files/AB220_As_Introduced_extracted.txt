22 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
23 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
24 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
25 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
26 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
27 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
28 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
29 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
30 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
31 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
32 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
33 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
34 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
35 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
36 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
37 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
38 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
39 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
40 electronically, the confidential information from the information
41 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
42 confidential.
43 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
44 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
45 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
-
*AB220*
– 13 –
1 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
2 means of an electronic medium if:
3 (a) The public record:
4 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
5 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
6 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
7 means of an electronic medium would:
8 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
9 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
10 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
11 information that is not otherwise confidential.
12 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
13 has legal custody or control of a public record:
14 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
15 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
16 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
17 medium.
18 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
19 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
20 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
21 or herself.

24 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
25 tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and

32 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

37 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
38 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

40 electronically, the confidential information from the information
41 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
42 confidential.
43 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a

– 13 –
1 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
2 means of an electronic medium if:
3 (a) The public record:
4 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
5 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
6 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

8 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
9 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
10 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
11 information that is not otherwise confidential.
12 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
13 has legal custody or control of a public record:
14 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

16 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
17 medium.
18 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
19 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
