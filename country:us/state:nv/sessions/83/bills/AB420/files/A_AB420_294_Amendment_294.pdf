3 school to contract with the board of trustees of the school district in which the charter school
4 is located to provide school police officers. (NRS 388A.384, 391.281) [Section 1 of this bill
5 requires, if a school police officer or employee of a school district in a county whose
6 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) uses or orders the use of a
7 chemical agent or electronic stun device against a pupil or minor in certain settings, the school
8 in which he or she is assigned or the metropolitan police department or sheriff’s office that is
9 his or her employer, as applicable, to prepare and submit a report to the board of trustees of

25 (NRS 293.124) Section 3 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to establish and administer
26 the Voter Access Grant Program to provide grants of money from the Account for the Voter
27 Access Grant Program created by section 4 of this bill to eligible entities to support the
