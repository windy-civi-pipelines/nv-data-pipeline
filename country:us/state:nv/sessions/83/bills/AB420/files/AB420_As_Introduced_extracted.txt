7 (currently only Clark County) uses or orders the use of a chemical agent or
8 electronic stun device against a pupil or minor in certain settings, the school in
9 which he or she is assigned or the metropolitan police department or sheriff’s office
10 that is his or her employer, as applicable, to prepare and submit a report to the
11 board of trustees of the school district in which the incident occurred. Section 1
12 further requires: (1) certain information to be included in the report; (2) the board

19 Section 1 requires, after such an investigation has been completed, the board of
20 trustees to make available to the public not less than 30 days before the date of the
21 next succeeding general election a summary of any report submitted, investigation
22 conducted and determination made, and provides that this requirement may be
