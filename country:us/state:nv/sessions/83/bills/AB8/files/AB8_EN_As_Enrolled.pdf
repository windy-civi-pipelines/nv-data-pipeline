Assembly Bill No. 8–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising
provisions governing deposits of public money under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, with certain exceptions, all public money received by every
state officer, department or commission must be: (1) deposited on or before
Thursday of each week; and (2) if, on any day the money accumulated for deposit
is $10,000 or more, deposited not later than the next working day. However, if the
Department of Wildlife accumulates $10,000 or more, the money must be deposited
within 10 working days. (NRS 353.250) This bill also exempts the Division of State
Parks of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources from the
requirement to deposit $10,000 or more accumulated during any day by the next
working day and requires the Division to instead deposit the money within 10
working days.
