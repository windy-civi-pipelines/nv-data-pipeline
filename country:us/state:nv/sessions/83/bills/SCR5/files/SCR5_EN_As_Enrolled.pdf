FILE NUMBER..........
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION—Recognizing
antimicrobial resistance as a public health crisis and
encouraging certain actions be taken in response.
WHEREAS, Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to public
health that undermines the effectiveness of life-saving medications
and leads to an estimated 35,000 deaths in the United States each
year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of
the United States Department of Health and Human Services; and
WHEREAS, An antibiogram report prepared by the Division of
Epidemiology and Public Health Preparedness of Northern Nevada
Public Health found a statistically-significant increase in the rate of
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, commonly referred to
as MRSA, in Washoe County from 32 percent in 2022 to 36.2
percent in 2023; and
WHEREAS, A report published in 2023 by the National Institutes
of Health found MRSA to be one of the leading causes of hospital-
acquired infections, often leading to increased rates of morbidity
and mortality, prolonged hospital stays and increased costs of health
care; and
WHEREAS, Rapid and accurate diagnostic testing is essential to
reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, ensuring that patients receive
effective treatment while limiting the spread of antimicrobial-
resistant bacteria; and
WHEREAS, State Medicaid programs provide health care
coverage to millions of low-income persons nationwide, making
each program a critical stakeholder in addressing antimicrobial
resistance through the development and deployment of educational
initiatives, data collection and tracking programs and other similar
policies; and
WHEREAS, The implementation of policies that encourage the
development and use of innovative diagnostic tools and stewardship
programs requires collaboration between public and private
stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, Effective action to combat antimicrobial resistance
requires a multi-faceted approach that includes, without limitation,
surveillance, prevention, education, research and access by persons
to health care on an equitable basis; now, therefore, be it
RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, THE
ASSEMBLY CONCURRING, That the Nevada Legislature hereby

administer under Medicaid a program for antimicrobial stewardship
which may include, without limitation, adhering to evidence-based
guidelines for the prescribing of antimicrobial drugs; and be it
further
RESOLVED, That the Nevada Legislature supports the
implementation and deployment of public educational campaigns to
raise awareness about antimicrobial resistance, the importance of
appropriate antibiotic use and the role of diagnostics in improving
health outcomes; and be it further
RESOLVED, That the Nevada Legislature encourages the
Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to
facilitate collaboration with and among relevant public and private
entities to promote awareness in combating antimicrobial resistance;
and be it further

transmit a copy of this resolution to the Governor, the Director of
the Department of Health and Human Services and the
Administrator of the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy
of the Department; and be it further
