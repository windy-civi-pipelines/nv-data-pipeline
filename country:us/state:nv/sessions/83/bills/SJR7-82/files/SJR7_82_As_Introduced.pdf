SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to establish certain rights relating to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Article 1 of the Nevada Constitution sets forth certain inalienable rights of an
2 individual. (Nev. Const. Art. 1) This joint resolution proposes to amend the Nevada
3 Constitution by adding a new section to Article 1 which: (1) guarantees each
4 individual in this State a fundamental right to reproductive freedom; (2) authorizes
5 the State to regulate abortion care after fetal viability with certain exceptions; and
6 (3) prevents the State from penalizing, prosecuting or taking any other adverse
7 action against an individual or entity for exercising the right to reproductive
8 freedom or for aiding or assisting another individual in exercising his or her right to
9 reproductive freedom.

10 If this resolution is passed by the 2023 Legislature, it must also be passed by
11 the next Legislature and then approved by the voters in an election before the
12 proposed amendment to the Nevada Constitution becomes effective.
1 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
2 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That a new section, designated Section 25, be
3 added to Article 1 of the Nevada Constitution to read as follows:
4 Sec. 25. 1. Every individual has a fundamental right
5 to reproductive freedom, which entails the right to make and
6 effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy,
7 including, without limitation, prenatal care, childbirth,
8 postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation,
9 abortion, abortion care, management of a miscarriage and
10 infertility care. The right of an individual to reproductive
11 freedom shall not be denied, burdened or infringed upon
12 unless justified by a compelling State interest that is
13 achieved by the least restrictive means available.
14 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1, the
15 State may regulate the provision of abortion care after fetal
16 viability, provided that in no circumstance may the State
17 prohibit an abortion that, in the professional judgment of an
18 attending provider of health care, is medically indicated to
19 protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant
20 individual.
21 3. The State shall not penalize, prosecute or otherwise
22 take adverse action against an individual based on the
23 actual, potential, perceived or alleged outcome of the
24 pregnancy of the individual, including, without limitation, a
25 miscarriage, stillbirth or abortion.
26 4. The State shall not penalize, prosecute or otherwise
27 take adverse action against a provider of health care, who is
28 licensed by the State, for acting consistent with the
29 applicable scope of practice and standard of care for
30 performing an abortion upon, providing abortion care to or
31 providing reproductive care services to an individual who
32 has granted the individual’s voluntary consent.
33 5. The State shall not penalize, prosecute or otherwise
34 take adverse action against any individual or entity for
35 aiding or assisting another individual in exercising the right
36 of the individual to reproductive freedom with the voluntary
37 consent of the individual.
38 6. Nothing provided in this section narrows or limits
39 the right to equality or equal protection.
40 7. As used in this section:
-
*SJR7_82*

– 3 –
1 (a) “Compelling state interest” means an interest which
2 is limited exclusively to the State’s interest in protecting the
3 health of an individual who is seeking reproductive health
4 care that is consistent with accepted clinical standards of
5 practice.
6 (b) “Fetal viability” means the point in a pregnancy
7 when, in the professional judgment of an attending provider
8 of health care and based on the particular facts of the case,
9 there is a significant likelihood of the sustained survival of
10 the fetus outside the uterus without the application of
11 extraordinary medical measures.
12 (c) “Least restrictive means” means in a manner that
13 restricts or infringes upon the autonomous decision-making
14 of an individual to the slightest degree possible while
15 furthering a compelling state interest.
16 And be it further
17 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
18 passage.
