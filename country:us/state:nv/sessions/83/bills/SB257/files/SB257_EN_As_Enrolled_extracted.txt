CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to autism; revising requirements governing the
statewide standard for measuring outcomes and assessing and
evaluating certain persons with autism spectrum disorders;
revising requirements governing early intervention services
for persons with autism spectrum disorders; requiring an
insurer to accept as dispositive certain diagnoses of persons
with autism spectrum disorders for purposes related to
required coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of such
disorders; requiring insurers to cover such diagnosis and
treatment provided by any provider of health care acting
within his or her scope of practice; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
Department of Health and Human Services to prescribe by regulation a statewide
standard for measuring outcomes and assessing and evaluating persons with autism
spectrum disorders through the age of 21 years who receive services through the
State or a local government or an agency thereof. Existing law requires those
regulations to designate a protocol based upon accepted best practices guidelines
which includes at least one standardized assessment instrument that requires direct
observation by the professional conducting the assessment for determining whether
a person is a person with autism spectrum disorder. Existing law requires such
direct observation to include an evaluation to measure behaviors of the person
which are consistent with autism spectrum disorder, cognitive functioning,
language functioning and adaptive functioning. (NRS 427A.872) Section 3 of this
bill removes the requirements that the statewide standard include a specific
protocol, a standardized assessment instrument and an evaluation to measure
behaviors which are consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, section 3
requires the statewide standard to require direct observation and an assessment to
determine whether a person is a person with autism spectrum disorder. Section 3
authorizes any provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice to
conduct such direct observation and assessment. Section 4 of this bill makes similar
revisions relating to early intervention services provided by the Division for
children with autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, section 4: (1) replaces
references to an evaluation of a child who may have autism spectrum disorder by
the Division with references to an assessment of such a child; and (2) authorizes
any provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice to conduct
such an assessment. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “provider of health care”
for those purposes, and section 2 of this bill prescribes the applicability of that
definition.
Existing law requires the Division to ensure that employees and contractors of
the Division who provide early intervention services to children with autism
-

spectrum disorders possess the knowledge and skills necessary to serve children
with autism spectrum disorders, including the screening of a child for autism
spectrum disorder at certain age levels and frequency. (NRS 427A.878) Section 4
specifies that such persons must possess the knowledge and skills necessary to
conduct early and periodic developmental screening of a child for that purpose.
Existing law requires certain plans of health insurance, including insurance for
public employees and Medicaid managed care plans, to cover screening for and
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders and for treatment of autism spectrum
disorders to persons under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high school, until
the person reaches the age of 22 years. In order for coverage of such treatment to be
required, existing law requires: (1) the diagnosis to be rendered by a licensed
physician or psychologist; (2) the treatment to be included in a treatment plan
developed by a licensed physician or psychologist; and (3) the treatment to be
provided by or under the supervision of a licensed physician, psychologist or
behavior analyst. (NRS 287.0276, 287.04335, 689A.0435, 689B.0335, 689C.1655,
695C.050, 695C.1717, 695G.1645) Sections 5-10 of this bill remove requirements
that, in order for such coverage to be required, the diagnosis must be rendered by
specific providers of health care and the treatment plan must be developed and
carried out by specific providers of health care. Instead, sections 5-10 require
certain plans of health insurance to cover such diagnosis and treatment if the
diagnosis, development of a treatment plan and treatment are performed by any
provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice. Sections 5-10 also
require an insurer to accept as dispositive for the purposes of such coverage any
diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder that is rendered in accordance with the
statewide standard prescribed pursuant to section 3.

Senate Bill No. 257–Senators Dondero Loop, Cruz-Crawford,
Krasner, Ohrenschall; Cannizzaro, Flores, Nguyen, Pazina
and Rogich
Joint Sponsor: Assemblymember Torres-Fossett
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to autism; revising requirements governing the
statewide standard for measuring outcomes and assessing and
evaluating certain persons with autism spectrum disorders;
revising requirements governing early intervention services
for persons with autism spectrum disorders; requiring an
insurer to accept as dispositive certain diagnoses of persons
with autism spectrum disorders for purposes related to
required coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of such
disorders; requiring insurers to cover such diagnosis and
treatment provided by any provider of health care acting
within his or her scope of practice; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
Department of Health and Human Services to prescribe by regulation a statewide
standard for measuring outcomes and assessing and evaluating persons with autism
spectrum disorders through the age of 21 years who receive services through the
State or a local government or an agency thereof. Existing law requires those
regulations to designate a protocol based upon accepted best practices guidelines
which includes at least one standardized assessment instrument that requires direct
observation by the professional conducting the assessment for determining whether
a person is a person with autism spectrum disorder. Existing law requires such
direct observation to include an evaluation to measure behaviors of the person
which are consistent with autism spectrum disorder, cognitive functioning,
language functioning and adaptive functioning. (NRS 427A.872) Section 3 of this
bill removes the requirements that the statewide standard include a specific
protocol, a standardized assessment instrument and an evaluation to measure
behaviors which are consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, section 3
requires the statewide standard to require direct observation and an assessment to
determine whether a person is a person with autism spectrum disorder. Section 3
authorizes any provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice to
conduct such direct observation and assessment. Section 4 of this bill makes similar
revisions relating to early intervention services provided by the Division for
children with autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, section 4: (1) replaces
references to an evaluation of a child who may have autism spectrum disorder by
the Division with references to an assessment of such a child; and (2) authorizes
any provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice to conduct
such an assessment. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “provider of health care”
for those purposes, and section 2 of this bill prescribes the applicability of that
definition.
Existing law requires the Division to ensure that employees and contractors of
the Division who provide early intervention services to children with autism

spectrum disorders possess the knowledge and skills necessary to serve children
with autism spectrum disorders, including the screening of a child for autism
spectrum disorder at certain age levels and frequency. (NRS 427A.878) Section 4
specifies that such persons must possess the knowledge and skills necessary to
conduct early and periodic developmental screening of a child for that purpose.
Existing law requires certain plans of health insurance, including insurance for
public employees and Medicaid managed care plans, to cover screening for and
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders and for treatment of autism spectrum
disorders to persons under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high school, until
the person reaches the age of 22 years. In order for coverage of such treatment to be
required, existing law requires: (1) the diagnosis to be rendered by a licensed
physician or psychologist; (2) the treatment to be included in a treatment plan
developed by a licensed physician or psychologist; and (3) the treatment to be
provided by or under the supervision of a licensed physician, psychologist or
behavior analyst. (NRS 287.0276, 287.04335, 689A.0435, 689B.0335, 689C.1655,
695C.050, 695C.1717, 695G.1645) Sections 5-10 of this bill remove requirements
that, in order for such coverage to be required, the diagnosis must be rendered by
specific providers of health care and the treatment plan must be developed and
carried out by specific providers of health care. Instead, sections 5-10 require
certain plans of health insurance to cover such diagnosis and treatment if the
diagnosis, development of a treatment plan and treatment are performed by any
provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice. Sections 5-10 also
require an insurer to accept as dispositive for the purposes of such coverage any
diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder that is rendered in accordance with the
statewide standard prescribed pursuant to section 3.
