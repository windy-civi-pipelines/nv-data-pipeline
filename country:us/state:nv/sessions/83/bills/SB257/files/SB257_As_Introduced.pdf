EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to autism; revising requirements governing the
statewide standard for measuring outcomes and assessing
and evaluating certain persons with autism spectrum
disorders; revising requirements governing early
intervention services for persons with autism spectrum
disorders; requiring an insurer to accept as dispositive
certain diagnoses of persons with autism spectrum
disorders for purposes related to required coverage for the
diagnosis and treatment of such disorders; requiring
insurers to cover such diagnosis and treatment provided
by any provider of health care acting within his or her
scope of practice; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to prescribe by regulation a statewide
3 standard for measuring outcomes and assessing and evaluating persons with autism
4 spectrum disorders through the age of 21 years who receive services through the
5 State or a local government or an agency thereof. Existing law requires those
6 regulations to designate a protocol based upon accepted best practices guidelines
-

7 which includes at least one standardized assessment instrument that requires direct
8 observation by the professional conducting the assessment for determining whether
9 a person is a person with autism spectrum disorder. Existing law requires such
10 direct observation to include an evaluation to measure behaviors of the person
11 which are consistent with autism spectrum disorder, cognitive functioning,
12 language functioning and adaptive functioning. (NRS 427A.872) Section 3 of this
13 bill removes the requirements that the statewide standard include a specific
14 protocol, a standardized assessment instrument and an evaluation to measure
15 behaviors which are consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Instead, section 3
16 requires the statewide standard to require direct observation and an assessment to
17 determine whether a person is a person with autism spectrum disorder. Section 3
18 authorizes any provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice to
19 conduct such direct observation and assessment. Section 4 of this bill makes similar
20 revisions relating to early intervention services provided by the Division for
21 children with autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, section 4: (1) replaces
22 references to an evaluation of a child who may have autism spectrum disorder by
23 the Division with references to an assessment of such a child; and (2) authorizes
24 any provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice to conduct
25 such an assessment. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “provider of health care”
26 for those purposes, and section 2 of this bill prescribes the applicability of that
27 definition.
28 Existing law requires the Division to ensure that employees and contractors of
29 the Division who provide early intervention services to children with autism
30 spectrum disorders possess the knowledge and skills necessary to serve children
31 with autism spectrum disorders, including the screening of a child for autism
32 spectrum disorder at certain age levels and frequency. (NRS 427A.878) Section 4
33 specifies that such persons must possess the knowledge and skills necessary to
34 conduct early and periodic developmental screening of a child for that purpose.
35 Existing law requires certain plans of health insurance, including insurance for
36 public employees and Medicaid managed care plans, to cover screening for and
37 diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders and for treatment of autism spectrum
38 disorders to persons under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high school, until
39 the person reaches the age of 22 years. In order for coverage of such treatment to be
40 required, existing law requires: (1) the diagnosis to be rendered by a licensed
41 physician or psychologist; (2) the treatment to be included in a treatment plan
42 developed by a licensed physician or psychologist; and (3) the treatment to be
43 provided by or under the supervision of a licensed physician, psychologist or
44 behavior analyst. (NRS 287.0276, 287.04335, 689A.0435, 689B.0335, 689C.1655,
45 695C.050, 695C.1717, 695G.1645) Sections 5-10 of this bill remove requirements
46 that, in order for such coverage to be required, the diagnosis must be rendered by
47 specific providers of health care and the treatment plan must be developed and
48 carried out by specific providers of health care. Instead, sections 5-10 require
49 certain plans of health insurance to cover such diagnosis and treatment if the
50 diagnosis, development of a treatment plan and treatment are performed by any
51 provider of health care acting within his or her scope of practice. Sections 5-10 also
52 require an insurer to accept as dispositive for the purposes of such coverage any
53 diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder that is rendered in accordance with the
54 statewide standard prescribed pursuant to section 3.
