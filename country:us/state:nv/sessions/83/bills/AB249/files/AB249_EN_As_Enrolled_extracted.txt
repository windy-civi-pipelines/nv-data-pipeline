Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the summary of a bill or joint resolution introduced in the
Legislature to include certain statements relating to the fiscal effect on the State and
local government. (NRS 218D.415) Section 1 of this bill amends the summary of a
bill or joint resolution relating to the fiscal effect on the State from “Effect on the
State: Yes” to “Effect on the State: May have Fiscal Impact.” Section 1 further
requires the summary of a bill or resolution to include certain statements relating to
the fiscal effect of the bill or joint resolution on the State Highway Fund.
Existing law provides that, if a bill or joint resolution is submitted to a local
government for a fiscal note and the local government determines the bill or joint
resolution reduces the revenues or increases the expenditures of the local
government, the local government is required to prepare a fiscal note and return it
to the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau within 8 working
days. (NRS 218D.475) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Fiscal Analysis
Division to extend the period of time to return the fiscal note by not more than 7
additional days if the matter requires extended research.
