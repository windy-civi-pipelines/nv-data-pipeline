Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the summary of a bill or joint resolution introduced in the
2 Legislature to include certain statements relating to the fiscal effect on the State and local
3 government. (NRS 218D.415) Section 1 of this bill amends the summary of a bill or joint
4 resolution relating to the fiscal effect on the State from “Effect on the State: Yes” to “Effect
5 on the State: May have Fiscal Impact.” Section 1 further requires the summary of a bill or
6 resolution to include certain statements relating to the fiscal effect of the bill or joint
7 resolution on the State Highway Fund.
8 Existing law provides that, if a bill or joint resolution is submitted to a local
9 government for a fiscal note and the local government determines the bill or joint
10 resolution reduces the revenues or increases the expenditures of the local government,
11 the local government is required to prepare a fiscal note and return it to the Fiscal
12 Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau within 8 working days. (NRS
13 218D.475) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Fiscal Analysis Division to extend the
14 period of time to return the fiscal note by not more than 7 additional days if the matter
15 requires extended research.
16 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to consult with the Fiscal Analysis Division
17 [of the Legislative Counsel Bureau] to determine whether a petition for initiative or
18 referendum may have any anticipated financial effect on the State or local governments if the
19 initiative or referendum is approved by the voters. If the Fiscal Analysis Division determines
20 that the petition may have an anticipated financial effect on the State or local governments, the
21 Fiscal Analysis Division is required to prepare a fiscal note regarding the petition that includes
22 an explanation of any such effect. The Secretary of State is required to post on the Secretary
23 of State’s Internet website any fiscal note prepared by the Fiscal Analysis Division not later
24 than 10 business days after the Secretary of State receives the petition. (NRS 295.015)
25 Existing law also authorizes the description of effect of an initiative or referendum to be
26 challenged by filing a complaint in the First Judicial District Court not later than 15 days,
27 Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded, after a copy of the petition is placed on file with
Assembly Amendment No. 103 to Assembly Bill No. 249 Page 4
28 the Secretary of State. (NRS 295.061) Section 2 of this bill revises the deadline for posting the
29 fiscal note prepared by the Fiscal Analysis Division on the Internet website of the Secretary of
30 State to be: (1) if the description of effect of the petition is challenged in the First Judicial
31 District, not later than 10 business days after the decision of the First Judicial District Court
32 relating to the challenge is issued; or (2) if the description of effect is not challenged in the
