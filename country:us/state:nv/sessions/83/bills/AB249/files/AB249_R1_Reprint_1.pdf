10 resolution reduces the revenues or increases the expenditures of the local
11 government, the local government is required to prepare a fiscal note and return it
12 to the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau within 8 working
13 days. (NRS 218D.475) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Fiscal Analysis
14 Division to extend the period of time to return the fiscal note by not more than 7
15 additional days if the matter requires extended research.
16 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to consult with the Fiscal Analysis
17 Division to determine whether a petition for initiative or referendum may have any

24 note prepared by the Fiscal Analysis Division not later than 10 business days after

26 authorizes the description of effect of an initiative or referendum to be challenged
27 by filing a complaint in the First Judicial District Court not later than 15 days,
28 Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded, after a copy of the petition is placed on
29 file with the Secretary of State. (NRS 295.061) Section 2 of this bill revises the
30 deadline for posting the fiscal note prepared by the Fiscal Analysis Division on the
31 Internet website of the Secretary of State to be: (1) if the description of effect of
32 the petition is challenged in the First Judicial District, not later than 10 business
