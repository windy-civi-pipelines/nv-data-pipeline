Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the summary of a bill or joint resolution introduced in the
2 Legislature to include certain statements relating to the fiscal effect on the State and local
3 government. (NRS 218D.415) Section 1 of this bill amends the summary of a bill or joint
4 resolution relating to the fiscal effect on the State from “Effect on the State: Yes” to “Effect
5 on the State: May have Fiscal Impact.” Section 1 further requires the summary of a bill or
6 resolution to include certain statements relating to the fiscal effect of the bill or joint
7 resolution on the State Highway Fund.
8 Existing law provides that, if a bill or joint resolution is submitted to a local government
9 for a fiscal note and the local government determines the bill or joint resolution reduces the
10 revenues or increases the expenditures of the local government, the local government is
11 required to prepare a fiscal note and return it to the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative
12 Counsel Bureau within 8 working days. (NRS 218D.475) Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes
13 the Fiscal Analysis Division to extend the period of time to return the fiscal note by not more
14 than 7 additional days if the matter requires extended research.
15 [Existing law requires the Secretary of State to consult with the Fiscal Analysis Division
16 to determine whether a petition for initiative or referendum may have any anticipated financial
17 effect on the State or local governments if the initiative or referendum is approved by the
18 voters. If the Fiscal Analysis Division determines that the petition may have an anticipated
19 financial effect on the State or local governments, the Fiscal Analysis Division is required to
20 prepare a fiscal note regarding the petition that includes an explanation of any such effect. The
21 Secretary of State is required to post on the Secretary of State’s Internet website any fiscal
22 note prepared by the Fiscal Analysis Division not later than 10 business days after the
23 Secretary of State receives the petition. (NRS 295.015) Existing law also authorizes the
24 description of effect of an initiative or referendum to be challenged by filing a complaint in
25 the First Judicial District Court not later than 15 days, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays
26 excluded, after a copy of the petition is placed on file with the Secretary of State. (NRS
27 295.061) Section 2 of this bill revises the deadline for posting the fiscal note prepared by the

Senate Amendment No. 807 to Assembly Bill No. 249 First Reprint Page 4
28 Fiscal Analysis Division on the Internet website of the Secretary of State to be: (1) if the
29 description of effect of the petition is challenged in the First Judicial District, not later than 10
30 business days after the decision of the First Judicial District Court relating to the challenge is
31 issued; or (2) if the description of effect is not challenged in the First Judicial District, not
32 later than 10 business days after the last day to file a challenge.]
