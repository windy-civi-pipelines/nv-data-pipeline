11 financial effect on the State or local governments, the Fiscal Analysis Division is
12 required to prepare a fiscal note regarding the petition that includes an explanation
13 of any such effect. The Secretary of State is required to post on the Secretary of
14 State’s Internet website any fiscal note prepared by the Fiscal Analysis Division not
15 later than 10 business days after the Secretary of State receives the petition. (NRS
16 295.015) Existing law also authorizes the description of effect of an initiative or
17 referendum to be challenged by filing a complaint in the First Judicial District
18 Court not later than 15 days, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded, after a
19 copy of the petition is placed on file with the Secretary of State. (NRS 295.061)
