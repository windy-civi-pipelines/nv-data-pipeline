EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring a medical facility or a
provider of health care who uses generative artificial
intelligence to generate certain communications to ensure
that those communications include certain information;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities and
2 providers of health care in this State. (Chapters 449, 450B, 629-637B, 639-640B
3 and 640D-641D of NRS) Sections 1 and 7 of this bill require a medical facility or
4 provider of health care who uses generative artificial intelligence to generate a
5 written or verbal communication with a patient relating to his or her clinical
6 information to ensure that the communication includes: (1) a disclaimer stating that
7 the communication was generated by generative artificial intelligence; and (2) clear
8 instructions describing how the patient may contact certain persons for further
9 assistance. Sections 1 and 7 exempt from this requirement a written
10 communication that is read and reviewed by a provider of health care. Sections 2-6
11 and 8 of this bill make conforming changes to provide for the administration and
12 enforcement of the requirements of section 1 in the same manner as other
13 requirements imposed on medical facilities by existing law. Section 7 authorizes
14 the imposition of disciplinary action against a provider of health care who fails to
15 comply with the requirements of section 7.
