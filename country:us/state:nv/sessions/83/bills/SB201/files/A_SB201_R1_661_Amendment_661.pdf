EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to religious [freedom;] and cultural expression; prohibiting a
unit-owners’ association, a unit’s owner who rents or leases his or her
unit or a landlord from imposing certain restrictions on the display of
religious or cultural items; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest community to
2 adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and adopt rules and regulations
3 concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill restricts, with certain
4 exceptions, an association or unit’s owner who rents or leases his or her unit from prohibiting
5 a unit’s owner or occupant of a unit from engaging in the display of religious or cultural
6 items. Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill impose a similar restriction on landlords.
7 For the purposes of these restrictions, sections 1 and 1.3 define “display of religious or
8 cultural items” to mean, in general, an item [or combination of items made from certain
9 materials and] displayed or affixed in or on [an entry door or doorframe of] a unit or dwelling,
10 as applicable, because of sincerely held religious or cultural beliefs [.] , practices or
11 traditions.
