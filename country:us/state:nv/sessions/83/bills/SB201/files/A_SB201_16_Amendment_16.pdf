Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest community to
2 adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and adopt rules and regulations
3 concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) [This] Section 1 of this bill restricts, with certain
4 exceptions, an association or unit’s owner who rents or leases his or her unit from prohibiting
5 a unit’s owner or occupant of a unit from engaging in the display of religious items. Sections
6 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill impose a similar restriction on landlords.
7 [This bill defines] For the purposes of these restrictions, sections 1 and 1.3 define
8 “display of religious items” to mean, in general, an item or combination of items made from
9 certain materials and displayed or affixed on an entry door or doorframe of a unit or dwelling,
10 as applicable, because of sincerely held religious beliefs.
