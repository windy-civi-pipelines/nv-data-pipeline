EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to religious freedom; prohibiting a unit-owners’
association, a unit’s owner who rents or leases his or her
unit or a landlord from imposing certain restrictions on
the display of religious items; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest
2 community to adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and
3 adopt rules and regulations concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1
4 of this bill restricts, with certain exceptions, an association or unit’s owner who
5 rents or leases his or her unit from prohibiting a unit’s owner or occupant of a unit
6 from engaging in the display of religious items. Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill
7 impose a similar restriction on landlords.
8 For the purposes of these restrictions, sections 1 and 1.3 define “display of
9 religious items” to mean, in general, an item or combination of items made from
10 certain materials and displayed or affixed on an entry door or doorframe of a unit or
11 dwelling, as applicable, because of sincerely held religious beliefs.
