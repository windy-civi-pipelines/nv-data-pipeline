AN ACT relating to religious and cultural expression; prohibiting a
unit-owners’ association, a unit’s owner who rents or leases
his or her unit or a landlord from imposing certain restrictions
on the display of religious or cultural items; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest
community to adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and
adopt rules and regulations concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1
of this bill restricts, with certain exceptions, an association or unit’s owner who
rents or leases his or her unit from prohibiting a unit’s owner or occupant of a unit
from engaging in the display of religious or cultural items. Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of
this bill impose a similar restriction on landlords.
For the purposes of these restrictions, sections 1 and 1.3 define “display of
religious or cultural items” to mean, in general, an item displayed or affixed in or
on a unit or dwelling, as applicable, because of sincerely held religious or cultural
beliefs, practices or traditions.
