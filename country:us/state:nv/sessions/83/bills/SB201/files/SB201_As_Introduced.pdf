2 community to adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and
3 adopt rules and regulations concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) This bill
4 restricts, with certain exceptions, an association or unit’s owner who rents or leases
5 his or her unit from prohibiting a unit’s owner or occupant of a unit from engaging
6 in the display of religious items. This bill defines “display of religious items” to
7 mean, in general, an item or combination of items made from certain materials and
8 displayed or affixed on an entry door or doorframe of a unit because of sincerely
9 held religious beliefs.

6 association or rental agreement must not prohibit a unit’s owner
7 or an occupant of a unit from engaging in the display of religious
8 items within such physical portion of the common-interest
9 community as that owner or occupant has a right to occupy and
10 use exclusively.
11 2. The provisions of this section do not:
12 (a) Apply to a display of religious items that:
13 (1) Has a total size that is greater than 36 by 12 square

27 manner of the display of religious items by a unit’s owner or an
28 occupant of a unit.
29 3. An association or a unit’s owner who is performing or
30 causing to be performed any maintenance, repair or replacement
31 of an entry door or doorframe of a unit may require the unit’s
32 owner or an occupant of the unit to remove a display of religious
33 items on the entry door or doorframe during the time the work is
34 being performed. After the work is completed, the unit’s owner or
35 occupant must be permitted to return the display of religious items
36 to the entry door or doorframe. An association or unit’s owner
37 shall, before requiring a unit’s owner or occupant of a unit to
