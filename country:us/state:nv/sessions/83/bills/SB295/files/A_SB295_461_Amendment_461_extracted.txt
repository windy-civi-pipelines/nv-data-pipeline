Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or
2 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose population is
3 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of food. (NRS 446.861)
4 Sections [3-5] 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to sidewalk vendors.
5 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update certain
6 guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations adopted by the local
7 board of health governing sidewalk vendors; and (2) make certain documents available on the
8 Internet website of the local board of health in more than one language . [; (3) conduct
Senate Amendment No. 461 to Senate Bill No. 295 Page 4
9 outreach regarding certain provisions of existing regulations relating to sidewalk vendors; and
10 (4) conduct workshops and informational sessions relating to existing regulations governing
11 sidewalk vendors.
12 Section 8 of this bill requires a local board of health to establish a task force to advise the
13 local board of health on issues relating to the regulation of sidewalk vendors.]
14 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections [7-9] 7 and 9 of this bill to a
15 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county
16 whose population is 100,000 or more.
17 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations governing
18 sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the plans for the design of a
19 nonstationary conveyance and the [types] use of modular conveyances [that may be used]
20 by a sidewalk vendor; (2) [performing food preparation in certain kitchens; (3)] the use of
21 certain sinks [, water tanks and water heaters] by a sidewalk vendor; and [(4)] (3) the storage
22 of a conveyance in a private home.
23 Section 10 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a local board of health from
24 requiring a sidewalk vendor to prepare certain food items in a commercial grade
25 kitchen.
26 Section 11.5 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of
27 existing law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board, planning
28 commission or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town from adopting
29 certain ordinances and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations where sidewalk
30 vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food items, a conveyances or
31 apparatus; and (3) authorize the destruction of certain food items. Sections 11.5, 14.3

41 vendor; and (2) establish a process to preapprove [such] a person who purchases a

44 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing law
45 relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the definition. (NRS
46 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of “food establishment” any
47 establishment in which only whole produce or commercially prepackaged food which is not a
48 potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or displayed for sale and, as a result of this
49 change, such an establishment is not subject to the existing requirements governing food
50 establishments.
51 [Existing law provides that a cottage food operation that meets certain requirements and
52 sells certain food items, including nuts and nut mixes, candies, jams, jellies and preserves and
53 certain baked goods is not a food establishment and is thus exempt from various requirements
54 governing food establishments. (NRS 446.020, 446.866) Section 4 of this bill defines “cottage
55 food operation” for the purposes of this exemption to include a natural person who operates as
56 a sidewalk vendor and sells, prepares or manufactures food items for sale from a conveyance
57 to a natural person and whose gross sales of such food items are not more than $35,000 per
58 calendar year.
59 Section 10 of this bill provides that a cottage food operation is not a food establishment

62 sold from a conveyance and require no food preparation or limited food preparation on the
63 conveyance by the natural person selling the food item; and (2) the food item must be
64 prepared on the conveyance for immediate service, prepackaged by the natural person for sale
65 from the conveyance or purchased prepackaged and sold in the original packaging from the
66 conveyance. Section 10 further sets forth the types of food items that such a cottage food
67 operation may sell.

68 Sections 11 and 14 of this bill move and reorganize existing requirements governing
69 cottage food operations and apply such requirements to cottage food operations that meet the
70 requirements of section 10.]
71 Section 2 [of this bill] applies the definitions in sections [3-5] 3 and 5 to the provisions
72 of existing law relating to food establishments.

AN ACT relating to food establishments; requiring certain local boards of health to
provide certain information [and outreach] relating to sidewalk

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or
2 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose population is
3 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of food. (NRS 446.861)
4 Sections [3-5] 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to sidewalk vendors.
5 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update certain
6 guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations adopted by the local
7 board of health governing sidewalk vendors; and (2) make certain documents available on the
8 Internet website of the local board of health in more than one language . [; (3) conduct

Senate Amendment No. 461 to Senate Bill No. 295 Page 4
9 outreach regarding certain provisions of existing regulations relating to sidewalk vendors; and
10 (4) conduct workshops and informational sessions relating to existing regulations governing
11 sidewalk vendors.
12 Section 8 of this bill requires a local board of health to establish a task force to advise the
13 local board of health on issues relating to the regulation of sidewalk vendors.]
14 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections [7-9] 7 and 9 of this bill to a
15 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county
16 whose population is 100,000 or more.
17 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations governing
18 sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the plans for the design of a
19 nonstationary conveyance and the [types] use of modular conveyances [that may be used]
20 by a sidewalk vendor; (2) [performing food preparation in certain kitchens; (3)] the use of
21 certain sinks [, water tanks and water heaters] by a sidewalk vendor; and [(4)] (3) the storage
22 of a conveyance in a private home.
23 Section 10 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a local board of health from
24 requiring a sidewalk vendor to prepare certain food items in a commercial grade
25 kitchen.
26 Section 11.5 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of
27 existing law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board, planning
28 commission or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town from adopting
29 certain ordinances and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations where sidewalk
30 vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food items, a conveyances or
31 apparatus; and (3) authorize the destruction of certain food items. Sections 11.5, 14.3
32 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit, with certain exceptions, such governmental entities
33 from limiting the types of food items a sidewalk vendor may sell if such food items
34 comply with the regulations of a local board of health.
35 Section 9 [of this bill] requires a local board of health to: (1) [enter into contracts and
36 other legal agreements with manufacturers of conveyances to provide for the purchase of a
37 conveyance, the design of which complies] prepare, maintain and make publicly available
38 on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of nonstationary conveyances
39 that comply with the plans approved by the local board of health [, by a person seeking to
40 operate as] and a model menu of preapproved food items that may be sold by a sidewalk
41 vendor; and (2) establish a process to preapprove [such] a person who purchases a
42 nonstationary conveyance on the list and preapprove certain food items sold from such a
43 conveyance.
44 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing law
45 relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the definition. (NRS
46 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of “food establishment” any
47 establishment in which only whole produce or commercially prepackaged food which is not a
48 potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or displayed for sale and, as a result of this
49 change, such an establishment is not subject to the existing requirements governing food
50 establishments.
51 [Existing law provides that a cottage food operation that meets certain requirements and
52 sells certain food items, including nuts and nut mixes, candies, jams, jellies and preserves and
53 certain baked goods is not a food establishment and is thus exempt from various requirements
54 governing food establishments. (NRS 446.020, 446.866) Section 4 of this bill defines “cottage
55 food operation” for the purposes of this exemption to include a natural person who operates as
56 a sidewalk vendor and sells, prepares or manufactures food items for sale from a conveyance
57 to a natural person and whose gross sales of such food items are not more than $35,000 per
58 calendar year.
59 Section 10 of this bill provides that a cottage food operation is not a food establishment
60 for the purposes of existing law governing food establishments if the food items sold by the
61 cottage food operation meet certain requirements, including that: (1) the food item must be
62 sold from a conveyance and require no food preparation or limited food preparation on the
63 conveyance by the natural person selling the food item; and (2) the food item must be
64 prepared on the conveyance for immediate service, prepackaged by the natural person for sale
65 from the conveyance or purchased prepackaged and sold in the original packaging from the
66 conveyance. Section 10 further sets forth the types of food items that such a cottage food
67 operation may sell.

Senate Amendment No. 461 to Senate Bill No. 295 Page 5
68 Sections 11 and 14 of this bill move and reorganize existing requirements governing
69 cottage food operations and apply such requirements to cottage food operations that meet the
70 requirements of section 10.]
71 Section 2 [of this bill] applies the definitions in sections [3-5] 3 and 5 to the provisions
72 of existing law relating to food establishments.
