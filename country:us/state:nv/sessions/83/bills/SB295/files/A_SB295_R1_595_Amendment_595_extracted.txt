Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or
2 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose population is
3 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of food. (NRS 446.861)
4 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to sidewalk vendors.
5 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update certain
6 guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations adopted by the local
7 board of health governing sidewalk vendors [;] and compact food cart vendors; and (2)
Assembly Amendment No. 595 to Senate Bill No. 295 First Reprint Page 4
8 make certain documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in more
9 than one language.
10 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections [7 and 9] 6-11.5 of this bill to a
11 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county
12 whose population is 100,000 or more.
13 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations governing
14 sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the plans for the design of a
15 nonstationary conveyance and the use of modular conveyances by a sidewalk vendor; (2) the
16 use of certain sinks by a sidewalk vendor; and (3) the storage of a conveyance in a private
17 home.
18 Section 9.5 requires a person who wishes to operate as a compact food cart vendor
19 to register with the local board of health and pay a fee established by regulation of the
20 local board of health. Section 2.5 of this bill defines “compact food cart vendor” to mean
21 a person who sells certain food items from a nonstationary conveyance. Section 9.5 also
22 requires a compact food cart vendor to comply with certain ordinances and regulations
23 adopted by the governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town that regulates
24 sidewalk vendors. Section 9.5 prohibits a compact food cart vendor from operating at a
25 special event unless the compact food cart vendor complies with certain requirements.
26 Section 9.5 further: (1) provides that a registration as a compact food cart vendor is
27 valid for a period of 1 year; (2) sets forth a process for the renewal of such registration;
28 and (3) requires the payment of a renewal fee established by regulation of the local
29 board of health.
30 Section 10 [of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions,] authorizes a [local board of
31 health from requiring a sidewalk vendor] compact food cart vendor to [prepare] sell certain
32 food items , which must be purchased prepackaged or prepared in a commercial grade
33 kitchen [.] or on the conveyance.
34 Section 11.5 [of this bill] provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of existing
35 law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board, planning commission
36 or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town from adopting certain ordinances
37 and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations where sidewalk vendors and compact food
38 cart vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food items, a [conveyances
39 or] conveyance, any cooking apparatus [;] or other products; and (3) authorize the
40 destruction of certain food items. Sections 11.5, 14.3 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit,
41 with certain exceptions, such governmental entities from limiting the types of food items a
42 sidewalk vendor or compact food cart vendor may sell if such food items comply with the
43 regulations of a local board of health [.] or are authorized by section 10.
44 Section 9 requires a local board of health to: (1) prepare, maintain and make publicly
45 available on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of [nonstationary
46 conveyances] food items that [comply with the plans] have been approved by the local board
47 of health and a model menu of preapproved food items that may be sold by a sidewalk vendor;
48 and (2) establish a process to [preapprove a person who purchases a nonstationary conveyance
49 on the list and] preapprove certain food items sold from [such] a conveyance.
50 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing law
51 relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the definition. (NRS
52 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of “food establishment” : (1) any
53 establishment in which only whole produce or commercially prepackaged food which is not a
54 potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or displayed for sale ; and [, as] (2) a compact
55 food cart vendor. As a result of this change, such an establishment [is] and a compact food
56 cart vendor are not subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
57 Section 2 applies the definitions in sections 2.5, 3 and 5 to the provisions of existing law
58 relating to food establishments.

AN ACT relating to food establishments; requiring certain local boards of health to
provide certain information relating to sidewalk vendors [;] and
compact food cart vendors; establishing requirements for a
compact food cart vendor; authorizing a registered compact food
cart vendor to sell certain food items; setting forth certain
requirements for the regulation of sidewalk vendors and compact food

a compact food cart vendor from the definition of “food
establishment”; revising certain requirements which certain local
boards of health are required to adopt relating to sidewalk vendors who
sell food; prohibiting certain governmental bodies from limiting the
types of food that may be sold by a sidewalk vendor [;] or compact
food cart vendor; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or
2 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose population is
3 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of food. (NRS 446.861)
4 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to sidewalk vendors.
5 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update certain
6 guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations adopted by the local
7 board of health governing sidewalk vendors [;] and compact food cart vendors; and (2)

Assembly Amendment No. 595 to Senate Bill No. 295 First Reprint Page 4
8 make certain documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in more
9 than one language.
10 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections [7 and 9] 6-11.5 of this bill to a
11 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county
12 whose population is 100,000 or more.
13 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations governing
14 sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the plans for the design of a
15 nonstationary conveyance and the use of modular conveyances by a sidewalk vendor; (2) the
16 use of certain sinks by a sidewalk vendor; and (3) the storage of a conveyance in a private
17 home.
18 Section 9.5 requires a person who wishes to operate as a compact food cart vendor
19 to register with the local board of health and pay a fee established by regulation of the
20 local board of health. Section 2.5 of this bill defines “compact food cart vendor” to mean
21 a person who sells certain food items from a nonstationary conveyance. Section 9.5 also
22 requires a compact food cart vendor to comply with certain ordinances and regulations
23 adopted by the governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town that regulates
24 sidewalk vendors. Section 9.5 prohibits a compact food cart vendor from operating at a
25 special event unless the compact food cart vendor complies with certain requirements.
26 Section 9.5 further: (1) provides that a registration as a compact food cart vendor is
27 valid for a period of 1 year; (2) sets forth a process for the renewal of such registration;
28 and (3) requires the payment of a renewal fee established by regulation of the local
29 board of health.
30 Section 10 [of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions,] authorizes a [local board of
31 health from requiring a sidewalk vendor] compact food cart vendor to [prepare] sell certain
32 food items , which must be purchased prepackaged or prepared in a commercial grade
33 kitchen [.] or on the conveyance.
34 Section 11.5 [of this bill] provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of existing
35 law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board, planning commission
36 or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town from adopting certain ordinances
37 and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations where sidewalk vendors and compact food
38 cart vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food items, a [conveyances
39 or] conveyance, any cooking apparatus [;] or other products; and (3) authorize the
40 destruction of certain food items. Sections 11.5, 14.3 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit,
41 with certain exceptions, such governmental entities from limiting the types of food items a
42 sidewalk vendor or compact food cart vendor may sell if such food items comply with the
43 regulations of a local board of health [.] or are authorized by section 10.
44 Section 9 requires a local board of health to: (1) prepare, maintain and make publicly
45 available on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of [nonstationary
46 conveyances] food items that [comply with the plans] have been approved by the local board
47 of health and a model menu of preapproved food items that may be sold by a sidewalk vendor;
48 and (2) establish a process to [preapprove a person who purchases a nonstationary conveyance
49 on the list and] preapprove certain food items sold from [such] a conveyance.
50 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing law
51 relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the definition. (NRS
52 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of “food establishment” : (1) any
53 establishment in which only whole produce or commercially prepackaged food which is not a
54 potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or displayed for sale ; and [, as] (2) a compact
55 food cart vendor. As a result of this change, such an establishment [is] and a compact food
56 cart vendor are not subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
57 Section 2 applies the definitions in sections 2.5, 3 and 5 to the provisions of existing law
58 relating to food establishments.
