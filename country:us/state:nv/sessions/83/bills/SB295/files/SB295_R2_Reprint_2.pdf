Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is
2 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose
3 population is 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of
4 food. (NRS 446.861) Sections 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to
5 sidewalk vendors.
6 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update
7 certain guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations
8 adopted by the local board of health governing sidewalk vendors and compact food
9 cart vendors; and (2) make certain documents available on the Internet website of
10 the local board of health in more than one language.
11 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections 6-11.5 of this bill to a
12 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a
13 county whose population is 100,000 or more.
14 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations
15 governing sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the
16 plans for the design of a nonstationary conveyance and the use of modular
17 conveyances by a sidewalk vendor; (2) the use of certain sinks by a sidewalk
18 vendor; and (3) the storage of a conveyance in a private home.
19 Section 9.5 requires a person who wishes to operate as a compact food cart
20 vendor to register with the local board of health and pay a fee established by
21 regulation of the local board of health. Section 2.5 of this bill defines “compact
22 food cart vendor” to mean a person who sells certain food items from a
23 nonstationary conveyance. Section 9.5 also requires a compact food cart vendor to
24 comply with certain ordinances and regulations adopted by the governing body of a
25 county, city or unincorporated town that regulates sidewalk vendors. Section 9.5
26 prohibits a compact food cart vendor from operating at a special event unless the
27 compact food cart vendor complies with certain requirements. Section 9.5 further:
28 (1) provides that a registration as a compact food cart vendor is valid for a period of
29 1 year; (2) sets forth a process for the renewal of such registration; and (3) requires
30 the payment of a renewal fee established by regulation of the local board of health.
31 Section 10 authorizes a compact food cart vendor to sell certain food items,
32 which must be purchased prepackaged or prepared in a commercial grade kitchen
33 or on the conveyance.
34 Section 11.5 provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of existing
35 law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board, planning
36 commission or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town from
37 adopting certain ordinances and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations where
38 sidewalk vendors and compact food cart vendors are allowed to operate; (2)
39 authorize the seizure of food items, a conveyance, any cooking apparatus or other
40 products; and (3) authorize the destruction of certain food items. Sections 11.5,
41 14.3 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit, with certain exceptions, such
42 governmental entities from limiting the types of food items a sidewalk vendor or
43 compact food cart vendor may sell if such food items comply with the regulations
44 of a local board of health or are authorized by section 10.
45 Section 9 requires a local board of health to: (1) prepare, maintain and make
46 publicly available on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of food
47 items that have been approved by the local board of health and a model menu of
48 preapproved food items that may be sold by a sidewalk vendor; and (2) establish a
49 process to preapprove certain food items sold from a conveyance.
50 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing
51 law relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the
52 definition. (NRS 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of
53 “food establishment”: (1) any establishment in which only whole produce or
54 commercially prepackaged food which is not a potentially hazardous food is sold or
-

55 offered or displayed for sale; and (2) a compact food cart vendor. As a result of this
56 change, such an establishment and a compact food cart vendor are not subject to the
57 existing requirements governing food establishments.
58 Section 2 applies the definitions in sections 2.5, 3 and 5 to the provisions of
59 existing law relating to food establishments.
