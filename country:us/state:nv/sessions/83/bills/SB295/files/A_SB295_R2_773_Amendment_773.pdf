Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or
2 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose population is
3 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of food. (NRS 446.861)
4 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to sidewalk vendors.
5 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update certain
6 guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations adopted by the local
7 board of health governing sidewalk vendors and compact food cart vendors; and (2) make
8 certain documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in more than
9 one language.

Assembly Amendment No. 773 to Senate Bill No. 295 Second Reprint Page 4
10 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections 6-11.5 of this bill to a local board
11 of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county whose
12 population is 100,000 or more.
13 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations governing
14 sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the plans for the design of a
15 nonstationary conveyance and the use of modular conveyances by a sidewalk vendor; (2) the
16 use of certain sinks by a sidewalk vendor; and (3) the storage of a conveyance in a private
17 home.
18 Section 9.5 requires a person who wishes to operate as a compact food cart vendor to
19 register with the local board of health and pay [a] the fee established by regulation of the local
20 board of health [.] , if such a fee has been established. Section 2.5 of this bill defines
21 “compact food cart vendor” to mean a person who sells certain food items from a
22 nonstationary conveyance. Section 9.5 also requires a compact food cart vendor to comply
23 with certain ordinances and regulations adopted by the governing body of a county, city or
24 unincorporated town that regulates sidewalk vendors. Section 9.5 prohibits a compact food
25 cart vendor from operating at a special event unless the compact food cart vendor complies
26 with certain requirements. Section 9.5 further: (1) provides that a registration as a compact
27 food cart vendor is valid for a period of 1 year; (2) sets forth a process for the renewal of such
28 registration; and (3) requires the payment of a renewal fee established by regulation of the
29 local board of health [.] , if such a fee has been established.
30 Section 10 authorizes a compact food cart vendor to sell certain food items, which must
31 be purchased prepackaged or prepared in a commercial grade kitchen or on the conveyance.
32 Section 11.5 provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of existing law and
33 sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board, planning commission or
34 governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town from adopting certain ordinances and
35 regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations where sidewalk vendors and compact food cart
36 vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food items, a conveyance, any
37 cooking apparatus or other products; and (3) authorize the destruction of certain food items.
38 Sections 11.5, 14.3 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit, with certain exceptions, such
39 governmental entities from limiting the types of food items a sidewalk vendor or compact
40 food cart vendor may sell if such food items comply with the regulations of a local board of
41 health or are authorized by section 10.
42 Section 9 requires a local board of health to: (1) prepare, maintain and make publicly
43 available on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of food items that have been
44 approved by the local board of health and a model menu of preapproved food items that may
45 be sold by a sidewalk vendor; and (2) establish a process to preapprove certain food items sold
46 from a conveyance.
47 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing law
48 relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the definition. (NRS
49 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of “food establishment”: (1) any
50 establishment in which only whole produce or commercially prepackaged food which is not a
51 potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or displayed for sale; and (2) a compact food cart
52 vendor. As a result of this change, such an establishment and a compact food cart vendor are
53 not subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
54 Section 2 applies the definitions in sections 2.5, 3 and 5 to the provisions of existing law
55 relating to food establishments.
