6 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update
7 certain guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations
8 adopted by the local board of health governing sidewalk vendors; (2) make certain
9 documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in more
10 than one language; (3) conduct outreach regarding certain provisions of existing
11 regulations relating to sidewalk vendors; and (4) conduct workshops and
12 informational sessions relating to existing regulations governing sidewalk vendors.
13 Section 8 of this bill requires a local board of health to establish a task force to
14 advise the local board of health on issues relating to the regulation of sidewalk
15 vendors.
16 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections 7-9 to a local board of
17 health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county whose
18 population is 100,000 or more.
19 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations
20 governing sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the
21 plans for the design of a conveyance and the types of conveyances that may be used
22 by a sidewalk vendor; (2) performing food preparation in certain kitchens; (3) the
23 use of sinks, water tanks and water heaters by a sidewalk vendor; and (4) the
24 storage of a conveyance in a private home.
25 Section 9 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) enter into contracts
26 and other legal agreements with manufacturers of conveyances to provide for the
27 purchase of a conveyance, the design of which complies with the plans approved by
28 the local board of health, by a person seeking to operate as a sidewalk vendor; and
29 (2) establish a process to preapprove such a person and preapprove certain food
30 items sold from such a conveyance.
31 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing
32 law relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the
33 definition. (NRS 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of
34 “food establishment” any establishment in which only whole produce or
35 prepackaged food which is not a potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or
36 displayed for sale and, as a result of this change, such an establishment is not
37 subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
38 Existing law provides that a cottage food operation that meets certain
39 requirements and sells certain food items, including nuts and nut mixes, candies,
40 jams, jellies and preserves and certain baked goods is not a food establishment and
41 is thus exempt from various requirements governing food establishments. (NRS
42 446.020, 446.866) Section 4 of this bill defines “cottage food operation” for the
43 purposes of this exemption to include a natural person who operates as a sidewalk
44 vendor and sells, prepares or manufactures food items for sale from a conveyance
45 to a natural person and whose gross sales of such food items are not more than
46 $35,000 per calendar year.
47 Section 10 of this bill provides that a cottage food operation is not a food
48 establishment for the purposes of existing law governing food establishments if the
49 food items sold by the cottage food operation meet certain requirements, including
50 that: (1) the food item must be sold from a conveyance and require no food
51 preparation or limited food preparation on the conveyance by the natural person
52 selling the food item; and (2) the food item must be prepared on the conveyance for
53 immediate service, prepackaged by the natural person for sale from the conveyance
54 or purchased prepackaged and sold in the original packaging from the conveyance.
55 Section 10 further sets forth the types of food items that such a cottage food
56 operation may sell.
57 Sections 11 and 14 of this bill move and reorganize existing requirements
58 governing cottage food operations and apply such requirements to cottage food
59 operations that meet the requirements of section 10.

AN ACT relating to food establishments; requiring certain local
boards of health to provide certain information and
outreach relating to sidewalk vendors; requiring certain
local boards of health to establish a task force relating to
sidewalk vendors; requiring certain local boards of health
to enter into certain agreements relating to conveyances;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is
2 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose
3 population is 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of
4 food. (NRS 446.861) Sections 3-5 of this bill define certain terms relating to
5 sidewalk vendors.
-
*SB295*

– 2 –
6 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update
7 certain guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations
8 adopted by the local board of health governing sidewalk vendors; (2) make certain
9 documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in more
10 than one language; (3) conduct outreach regarding certain provisions of existing
11 regulations relating to sidewalk vendors; and (4) conduct workshops and
12 informational sessions relating to existing regulations governing sidewalk vendors.
13 Section 8 of this bill requires a local board of health to establish a task force to
14 advise the local board of health on issues relating to the regulation of sidewalk
15 vendors.
16 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections 7-9 to a local board of
17 health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a county whose
18 population is 100,000 or more.
19 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations
20 governing sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the
21 plans for the design of a conveyance and the types of conveyances that may be used
22 by a sidewalk vendor; (2) performing food preparation in certain kitchens; (3) the
23 use of sinks, water tanks and water heaters by a sidewalk vendor; and (4) the
24 storage of a conveyance in a private home.
25 Section 9 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) enter into contracts
26 and other legal agreements with manufacturers of conveyances to provide for the
27 purchase of a conveyance, the design of which complies with the plans approved by
28 the local board of health, by a person seeking to operate as a sidewalk vendor; and
29 (2) establish a process to preapprove such a person and preapprove certain food
30 items sold from such a conveyance.
31 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing
32 law relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the
33 definition. (NRS 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of
34 “food establishment” any establishment in which only whole produce or
35 prepackaged food which is not a potentially hazardous food is sold or offered or
36 displayed for sale and, as a result of this change, such an establishment is not
37 subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
38 Existing law provides that a cottage food operation that meets certain
39 requirements and sells certain food items, including nuts and nut mixes, candies,
40 jams, jellies and preserves and certain baked goods is not a food establishment and
41 is thus exempt from various requirements governing food establishments. (NRS
42 446.020, 446.866) Section 4 of this bill defines “cottage food operation” for the
43 purposes of this exemption to include a natural person who operates as a sidewalk
44 vendor and sells, prepares or manufactures food items for sale from a conveyance
45 to a natural person and whose gross sales of such food items are not more than
46 $35,000 per calendar year.
47 Section 10 of this bill provides that a cottage food operation is not a food
48 establishment for the purposes of existing law governing food establishments if the
49 food items sold by the cottage food operation meet certain requirements, including
50 that: (1) the food item must be sold from a conveyance and require no food
51 preparation or limited food preparation on the conveyance by the natural person
52 selling the food item; and (2) the food item must be prepared on the conveyance for
53 immediate service, prepackaged by the natural person for sale from the conveyance
54 or purchased prepackaged and sold in the original packaging from the conveyance.
55 Section 10 further sets forth the types of food items that such a cottage food
56 operation may sell.
57 Sections 11 and 14 of this bill move and reorganize existing requirements
58 governing cottage food operations and apply such requirements to cottage food
59 operations that meet the requirements of section 10.
