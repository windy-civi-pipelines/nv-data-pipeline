EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to food establishments; requiring certain local
boards of health to provide certain information relating to
sidewalk vendors; setting forth certain requirements for
the regulation of sidewalk vendors by certain local boards
of health and certain local zoning boards, planning

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a local board of health in a county whose population is
2 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or a city in a county whose
3 population is 100,000 or more to adopt regulations governing sidewalk vendors of
4 food. (NRS 446.861) Sections 3 and 5 of this bill define certain terms relating to
5 sidewalk vendors.
-
*SB295_R1*
– 2 –
6 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update
7 certain guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations
8 adopted by the local board of health governing sidewalk vendors; and (2) make
9 certain documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in
10 more than one language.
11 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections 7 and 9 of this bill to a
12 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a
13 county whose population is 100,000 or more.
14 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations
15 governing sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the
16 plans for the design of a nonstationary conveyance and the use of modular
17 conveyances by a sidewalk vendor; (2) the use of certain sinks by a sidewalk
18 vendor; and (3) the storage of a conveyance in a private home.
19 Section 10 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a local board of health
20 from requiring a sidewalk vendor to prepare certain food items in a commercial
21 grade kitchen.
22 Section 11.5 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of
23 existing law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board,
24 planning commission or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town
25 from adopting certain ordinances and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations
26 where sidewalk vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food
27 items, a conveyances or apparatus; and (3) authorize the destruction of certain food
28 items. Sections 11.5, 14.3 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit, with certain
29 exceptions, such governmental entities from limiting the types of food items a
30 sidewalk vendor may sell if such food items comply with the regulations of a local
31 board of health.
32 Section 9 requires a local board of health to: (1) prepare, maintain and make
33 publicly available on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of
34 nonstationary conveyances that comply with the plans approved by the local board
35 of health and a model menu of preapproved food items that may be sold by a
36 sidewalk vendor; and (2) establish a process to preapprove a person who purchases
37 a nonstationary conveyance on the list and preapprove certain food items sold from
38 such a conveyance.
39 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing
40 law relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the
41 definition. (NRS 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of
42 “food establishment” any establishment in which only whole produce or
43 commercially prepackaged food which is not a potentially hazardous food is sold or
44 offered or displayed for sale and, as a result of this change, such an establishment is
45 not subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
46 Section 2 applies the definitions in sections 3 and 5 to the provisions of
47 existing law relating to food establishments.

6 Section 7 of this bill requires a local board of health to: (1) develop and update
7 certain guidance documents explaining the requirements of existing regulations
8 adopted by the local board of health governing sidewalk vendors; and (2) make
9 certain documents available on the Internet website of the local board of health in
10 more than one language.
11 Section 6 of this bill limits the applicability of sections 7 and 9 of this bill to a
12 local board of health in a county whose population is 100,000 or more or a city in a
13 county whose population is 100,000 or more.
14 Section 13 of this bill requires a local board of health to adopt regulations
15 governing sidewalk vendors of food, including requirements relating to: (1) the
16 plans for the design of a nonstationary conveyance and the use of modular
17 conveyances by a sidewalk vendor; (2) the use of certain sinks by a sidewalk
18 vendor; and (3) the storage of a conveyance in a private home.
19 Section 10 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, a local board of health
20 from requiring a sidewalk vendor to prepare certain food items in a commercial
21 grade kitchen.
22 Section 11.5 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that the provisions of
23 existing law and sections 2-11.5 of this bill do not prohibit a local zoning board,
24 planning commission or governing body of a county, city or unincorporated town
25 from adopting certain ordinances and regulations that: (1) prescribe the locations
26 where sidewalk vendors are allowed to operate; (2) authorize the seizure of food
27 items, a conveyances or apparatus; and (3) authorize the destruction of certain food
28 items. Sections 11.5, 14.3 and 14.7 of this bill further prohibit, with certain
29 exceptions, such governmental entities from limiting the types of food items a
30 sidewalk vendor may sell if such food items comply with the regulations of a local
31 board of health.
32 Section 9 requires a local board of health to: (1) prepare, maintain and make
33 publicly available on the Internet website of the local board of health a list of

36 sidewalk vendor; and (2) establish a process to preapprove a person who purchases
37 a nonstationary conveyance on the list and preapprove certain food items sold from
38 such a conveyance.
39 Existing law defines the term “food establishment” for the purposes of existing
40 law relating to food establishments and sets forth certain exceptions from the
41 definition. (NRS 446.020) Section 12 of this bill exempts from the definition of
42 “food establishment” any establishment in which only whole produce or
43 commercially prepackaged food which is not a potentially hazardous food is sold or
44 offered or displayed for sale and, as a result of this change, such an establishment is
45 not subject to the existing requirements governing food establishments.
46 Section 2 applies the definitions in sections 3 and 5 to the provisions of
47 existing law relating to food establishments.
