SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing annual reports of accountability of
public schools. (BDR 34-1074)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the inclusion of certain information
regarding pupil achievement in annual reports of accountability
submitted by the boards of trustees of school districts, the sponsors of
charter schools and the State Board of Education; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts, the sponsors of charter
2 schools and the State Board of Education to prepare and publicly disseminate annual reports
3 of accountability for the quality of schools and the educational achievement of pupils. (NRS
4 385A.070, 385A.400) Such annual reports of accountability are required to include
5 certain information concerning the results of pupils on criterion-referenced
6 examinations and the college and career readiness assessment. (NRS 385A.200,
7 385A.410) Existing law prohibits a separate reporting for a group of pupils if the number of
8 pupils in that group is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results
9 would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual pupil. (NRS 385A.070,
10 385A.400) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require that, unless the existing prohibition on
11 separate reporting for a group of pupils applies, the boards of trustees of school districts, the
12 sponsors of charter schools and the State Board of Education must include within annual
13 reports of accountability information on pupil achievement among [: (1)] pupils who have
14 accrued [10 or] more than 10 absences [within the school year; and (2) pupils whose
15 instruction in a core academic subject during the school year involved at least 4 consecutive
16 weeks of instruction provided by someone other than a licensed teacher.] before the first day
17 of the period prescribed by the State Board for the administration of criterion-
18 referenced examinations or the college and career readiness assessment at the school of
19 the pupil, whichever is earlier. Under sections 1 and 2, this information is required to be
20 [reported separately by gender and] reported separately by certain [other] pupil characteristics.
