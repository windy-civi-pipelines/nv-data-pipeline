CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the inclusion of certain
information regarding pupil achievement in annual reports
of accountability submitted by the boards of trustees of
school districts, the sponsors of charter schools and the
State Board of Education; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts, the sponsors of
2 charter schools and the State Board of Education to prepare and publicly
3 disseminate annual reports of accountability for the quality of schools and the
4 educational achievement of pupils. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.400) Existing law
5 prohibits a separate reporting for a group of pupils if the number of pupils in that
6 group is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would
7 reveal personally identifiable information about an individual pupil. (NRS
8 385A.070, 385A.400) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require that, unless the existing
9 prohibition on separate reporting for a group of pupils applies, the boards of
10 trustees of school districts, the sponsors of charter schools and the State Board of
11 Education must include within annual reports of accountability information on
12 pupil achievement among: (1) pupils who have accrued 10 or more absences within
13 the school year; and (2) pupils whose instruction in a core academic subject during
14 the school year involved at least 4 consecutive weeks of instruction provided by
15 someone other than a licensed teacher. Under sections 1 and 2, this information is
16 required to be reported separately by gender and reported separately by certain
17 other pupil characteristics.
