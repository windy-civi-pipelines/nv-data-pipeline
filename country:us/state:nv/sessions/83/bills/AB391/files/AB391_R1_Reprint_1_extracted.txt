SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing annual reports of
accountability of public schools. (BDR 34-1074)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the inclusion of certain
information regarding pupil achievement in annual reports
of accountability submitted by the boards of trustees of
school districts, the sponsors of charter schools and the
State Board of Education; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the boards of trustees of school districts, the sponsors of
2 charter schools and the State Board of Education to prepare and publicly
3 disseminate annual reports of accountability for the quality of schools and the
4 educational achievement of pupils. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.400) Such annual
5 reports of accountability are required to include certain information concerning the
6 results of pupils on criterion-referenced examinations and the college and career
7 readiness assessment. (NRS 385A.200, 385A.410) Existing law prohibits a separate
8 reporting for a group of pupils if the number of pupils in that group is insufficient
9 to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally
10 identifiable information about an individual pupil. (NRS 385A.070, 385A.400)
11 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require that, unless the existing prohibition on separate
12 reporting for a group of pupils applies, the boards of trustees of school districts, the
13 sponsors of charter schools and the State Board of Education must include within
14 annual reports of accountability information on pupil achievement among pupils
15 who have accrued more than 10 absences before the first day of the period
16 prescribed by the State Board for the administration of criterion-referenced
17 examinations or the college and career readiness assessment at the school of the
18 pupil, whichever is earlier. Under sections 1 and 2, this information is required to
19 be reported separately by certain pupil characteristics.
