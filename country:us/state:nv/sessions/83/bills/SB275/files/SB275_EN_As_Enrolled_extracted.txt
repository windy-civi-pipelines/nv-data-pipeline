Existing law provides that it is the policy of this State to: (1) ensure that minor
children have a continuing relationship with both parents after the parents have
ended their relationship; (2) encourage such parents to share the rights and
responsibilities of child rearing; and (3) establish that such parents have an
equivalent duty to provide their minor children with necessary maintenance,
healthcare, education and support. (NRS 125C.001) Section 5 of this bill: (1)

reuniting or reestablishing a relationship between a child and an estranged or
rejected parent or other family member of the child; and (2) prohibits a court from
issuing an order requiring a child to receive reunification treatment under certain
circumstances. Section 5 also prohibits a court from removing a child from a parent
or litigant or restricting contact between a child and a parent or litigant for the sole
purpose of improving a deficient relationship between the child and the other parent
of the child under certain circumstances.

Section 2:
Section 6 of this bill provides that in a child custody proceeding in which a
parent is alleged to have committed domestic violence or child abuse, expert
evidence relating to the alleged domestic violence or child abuse may only be
admitted by a professional who possesses certain expertise and clinical experience.

Section 3:
Section 6 also: (1) requires the court in any such proceeding to consider evidence
of past domestic violence or child abuse under certain circumstances; and (2)
prohibits the court in any such proceeding from issuing an order to remediate the
resistance of a child to have contact with a parent alleged to have committed
domestic violence or child abuse under certain circumstances.
Existing law requires each judge of the family court to attend a course designed
for the training of new judges within 12 months after taking office. (NRS 3.028)

Section 4:
Section 7 of this bill requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to: (1) include
ongoing training regarding domestic violence, child abuse and best practices in
family court in the regular education provided by the Office to judges; and (2) to
