Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that it is the policy of this State to: (1) ensure that minor
2 children have a continuing relationship with both parents after the parents have
3 ended their relationship; (2) encourage such parents to share the rights and
4 responsibilities of child rearing; and (3) establish that such parents have an
5 equivalent duty to provide their minor children with necessary maintenance,
6 healthcare, education and support. (NRS 125C.001) Section 5 of this bill: (1)
7 defines the term “reunification treatment” to mean a treatment or therapy aimed at
8 reuniting or reestablishing a relationship between a child and an estranged or
9 rejected parent or other family member of the child; and (2) prohibits a court from
10 issuing an order requiring a child to receive reunification treatment under certain
11 circumstances. Section 5 also prohibits a court from removing a child from a parent
12 or litigant or restricting contact between a child and a parent or litigant for the sole

13 purpose of improving a deficient relationship between the child and the other parent
14 of the child under certain circumstances.
15 Section 6 of this bill provides that in a child custody proceeding in which a
16 parent is alleged to have committed domestic violence or child abuse, expert
17 evidence relating to the alleged domestic violence or child abuse may only be
18 admitted by a professional who possesses certain expertise and clinical experience.
19 Section 6 also: (1) requires the court in any such proceeding to consider evidence
20 of past domestic violence or child abuse under certain circumstances; and (2)
21 prohibits the court in any such proceeding from issuing an order to remediate the
22 resistance of a child to have contact with a parent alleged to have committed
23 domestic violence or child abuse under certain circumstances.
24 Existing law requires each judge of the family court to attend a course designed
25 for the training of new judges within 12 months after taking office. (NRS 3.028)
26 Section 7 of this bill requires each judge who presides over a child custody
27 proceeding and certain other persons who have regular and routine contact with
28 persons involved in child custody proceedings to complete certain training relating
