EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to domestic relations; prohibiting a court with jurisdiction over a
child custody proceeding from taking certain actions for the sole
purpose of improving a deficient relationship between a child and a
parent of the child under certain circumstances; prohibiting any such
court from ordering a child to receive reunification treatment under
certain circumstances; requiring any such court to consider certain
evidence in making certain findings relating to allegations of domestic
violence or child abuse; requiring [a judge who presides over a child
custody proceeding and certain other persons] the Administrative
Office of the Courts to [complete certain] provide ongoing training
[relating to] regarding domestic violence , [and] child abuse [;] and
best practices in family court in the regular education provided by
the Office to judges; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that it is the policy of this State to: (1) ensure that minor children
2 have a continuing relationship with both parents after the parents have ended their
3 relationship; (2) encourage such parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child
4 rearing; and (3) establish that such parents have an equivalent duty to provide their minor
5 children with necessary maintenance, healthcare, education and support. (NRS 125C.001)
6 Section 5 of this bill: (1) defines the term “reunification treatment” to mean a treatment or
7 therapy aimed at reuniting or reestablishing a relationship between a child and an estranged or
8 rejected parent or other family member of the child; and (2) prohibits a court from issuing an
9 order requiring a child to receive reunification treatment under certain circumstances. Section
10 5 also prohibits a court from removing a child from a parent or litigant or restricting contact
11 between a child and a parent or litigant for the sole purpose of improving a deficient
12 relationship between the child and the other parent of the child under certain circumstances.
13 Section 6 of this bill provides that in a child custody proceeding in which a parent is
14 alleged to have committed domestic violence or child abuse, expert evidence relating to the
15 alleged domestic violence or child abuse may only be admitted by a professional who
16 possesses certain expertise and clinical experience. Section 6 also: (1) requires the court in
17 any such proceeding to consider evidence of past domestic violence or child abuse under
18 certain circumstances; and (2) prohibits the court in any such proceeding from issuing an
Senate Amendment No. 754 to Senate Bill No. 275 Page 4
19 order to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact with a parent alleged to have
20 committed domestic violence or child abuse under certain circumstances.
21 Existing law requires each judge of the family court to attend a course designed for the
22 training of new judges within 12 months after taking office. (NRS 3.028) Section 7 of this bill
23 requires [each judge who presides over a child custody proceeding and certain other persons
24 who have regular and routine contact with persons involved in child custody proceedings] the
25 Administrative Office of the Courts to [complete certain] : (1) include ongoing training
26 [relating to] regarding domestic violence , [and] child abuse [.] and best practices in family
27 court in the regular education provided by the Office to judges; and (2) to the extent of
28 available funding, offer such training to certain other persons. Under section 7, [any such]
29 this training must comply with certain provisions of federal law.
