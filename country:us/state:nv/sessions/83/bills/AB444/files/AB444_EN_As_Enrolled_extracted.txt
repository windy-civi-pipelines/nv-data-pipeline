CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions relating to the adoption of regulations by certain
agencies of the Executive Department of the State
Government; revising provisions relating to the adoption by a
governing body of a local government of certain ordinances
or the taking of certain actions relating to fees paid by
businesses; revising provisions relating to impact fees; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Nevada Administrative Procedure Act establishes procedural requirements
for the adoption of administrative regulations by agencies, officers and employees
of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
(NRS 233B.010-233B.120) Under the Act, such state agencies, officers and
employees are required to take certain actions to determine the impact of a
proposed regulation on for-profit businesses that employ less than 150 employees
before adopting a regulation that is likely to impose a direct and significant
economic burden upon such a small business or that directly restricts the formation,
operation or expansion of such a small business. (NRS 233B.0382, 233B.0608) The
Act further requires that after such actions are taken, the state agency, officer or
employee is required to prepare a small business impact statement and prescribes
the information required to be included in the statement. (NRS 233B.0608,
233B.0609) The Act also requires that an agency, before holding an initial public
hearing on a proposed regulation, conduct at least one workshop to solicit
comments from interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in
the regulation. (NRS 233B.061) Existing law also establishes procedural
requirements for the adoption by a local government of a rule, which is defined in
existing law to mean an ordinance and, with certain exceptions, an action taken that
imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of a fee that is paid by a
for-profit business. (NRS 237.030-237.150) One of the procedural prerequisites for
the adoption by a local government of such a rule that is likely to impose a direct
and significant economic burden upon a business or directly restricts the formation,
operation or expansion of a business is the notification of chambers of commerce
and trade associations of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.080) Existing law requires
inclusion in the business impact statement prepared by the local government
regarding such a proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be affected
by the proposed rule; and (2) a list of the chambers of commerce and trade
associations notified of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.090) Section 1 of this bill
imposes the same prerequisite of notifying chambers of commerce and trade
associations on a state agency, officer or employee subject to the Nevada
Administrative Procedure Act, in determining the impact of a proposed regulation
on small businesses, insofar as is practicable. Section 2 of this bill similarly
requires the state agency, officer or employee to include in the small business
impact statement for the proposed regulation the total number of small businesses
likely to be affected by the proposed regulation and a list of any chambers of
commerce and trade associations notified pursuant to section 1. Section 2.5 of this
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
bill requires an agency to notify by electronic mail chambers of commerce, trade
associations or owners and officers of businesses which are likely be affected by a
proposed regulation of the time and place set for a workshop to solicit comments
from interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the
regulation. Section 2.5 also requires an agency to maintain an electronic mailing
list of local chambers of commerce, trade associations and owners and officers of
businesses and to update the list not later than January 31 of each year.
Under existing law, a local government is not required to comply with the
procedural requirements for adopting a rule if the local government is taking action
that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee or
sales and use taxes. (NRS 237.060) Section 3 of this bill eliminates these
exemptions, thereby requiring a local government to comply with those procedural
requirements with respect to a proposed rule that imposes, increases or changes the
basis for the calculation of an impact fee or sales and use taxes.
Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a
proposed rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void.
(NRS 237.140) Section 4 of this bill clarifies that any such action is also
unenforceable.
Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees
to pay the cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions
necessitated or attributable to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under
existing law, a local government that wishes to impose an impact fee is required to
set a public hearing to consider the land use assumptions and to provide certain
notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5 of this bill requires
copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of
businesses that are likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.
