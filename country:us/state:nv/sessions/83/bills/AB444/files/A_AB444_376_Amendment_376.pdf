EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising provisions relating to
the adoption of regulations by certain agencies of the Executive
Department of the State Government; revising provisions relating to
the adoption by a governing body of a local government of certain
ordinances or the taking of certain actions relating to fees paid by
businesses; [authorizing certain legal actions to be taken for certain
violations relating to the adoption of such ordinances or taking of such
actions by a governing body of a local government;] revising
provisions relating to impact fees; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Administrative Procedure Act establishes procedural requirements for the
2 adoption of administrative regulations by agencies, officers and employees of the Executive
3 Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions. (NRS 233B.010-233B.120)
4 Under the Act, such state agencies, officers and employees are required to take certain actions
5 to determine the impact of a proposed regulation on for-profit businesses that employ less than
6 150 employees before adopting a regulation that is likely to impose a direct and significant
7 economic burden upon such a small business or that directly restricts the formation, operation
8 or expansion of such a small business. (NRS 233B.0382, 233B.0608) The Act further requires
9 that after such actions are taken, the state agency, officer or employee is required to prepare a
10 small business impact statement and prescribes the information required to be included in the
11 statement. (NRS 233B.0608, 233B.0609) The Act also requires that an agency, before
12 holding an initial public hearing on a proposed regulation, conduct at least one
13 workshop to solicit comments from interested persons on one or more general topics to
14 be addressed in the regulation. (NRS 233B.061) Existing law also establishes procedural
15 requirements for the adoption by a local government of a rule, which is defined in existing law
16 to mean an ordinance and, with certain exceptions, an action taken that imposes, increases or
17 changes the basis for the calculation of a fee that is paid by a for-profit business. (NRS
18 237.030-237.150) One of the procedural prerequisites for the adoption by a local government
19 of such a rule that is likely to impose a direct and significant economic burden upon a

Assembly Amendment No. 376 to Assembly Bill No. 444 Page 4
20 business or directly restricts the formation, operation or expansion of a business is the
21 notification of chambers of commerce and trade associations of the proposed rule. (NRS
22 237.080) Existing law requires inclusion in the business impact statement prepared by the
23 local government regarding such a proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be
24 affected by the proposed rule; and (2) a list of the chambers of commerce and trade
25 associations notified of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.090) Section 1 of this bill imposes the
26 same prerequisite of notifying chambers of commerce and trade associations on a state
27 agency, officer or employee subject to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act, in
28 determining the impact of a proposed regulation on small businesses, insofar as is practicable.
29 Section 2 of this bill similarly requires the state agency, officer or employee to include in the
30 small business impact statement for the proposed regulation the total number of small
31 businesses likely to be affected by the proposed regulation and a list of any chambers of
32 commerce and trade associations notified pursuant to section 1. Section 2.5 of this bill
33 requires an agency to notify by electronic mail chambers of commerce, trade
34 associations or owners and officers of businesses which are likely be affected by a
35 proposed regulation of the time and place set for a workshop to solicit comments from
36 interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the regulation.
37 Section 2.5 also requires an agency to maintain an electronic mailing list of local
38 chambers of commerce, trade associations and owners and officers of businesses and to
39 update the list not later than January 31 of each year.
40 Under existing law, a local government is not required to comply with the procedural
41 requirements for adopting a rule if the local government is taking action that imposes,
42 increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee or sales and use taxes.
43 (NRS 237.060) Section 3 of this bill eliminates [this exemption,] these exemptions, thereby
44 requiring a local government to comply with those procedural requirements with respect to a
45 proposed rule that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee
46 or sales and use taxes. Section 3 also clarifies that, for purposes of the procedural
47 requirements for adopting a rule, a “rule” is either: (1) an ordinance by the adoption of which
48 the governing body of a local government exercises legislative powers; or (2) an action taken
49 by the governing body of a local government that imposes, increases or changes the basis for
50 the calculation of a fee that is paid in whole or in substantial part by businesses. (See, e.g.,
51 Castellanos v. City of Reno, 629 F. Supp. 3d 1031, 1042 (D. Nev. 2022) (construing NRS
52 237.060 “as disjunctive because the alternative is contrary to common sense and the law’s
53 purpose”))
54 Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a proposed
55 rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void. (NRS 237.140) Section 4
56 of this bill [authorizes the Attorney General and certain persons to sue in a court of competent
57 jurisdiction: (1) to have any action to adopt a proposed rule in violation of the requirements
58 for adopting such a rule declared void; or (2) for an injunction against the local government to
59 require compliance with or prevent violations of the requirements for adopting such a rule.
60 Section 4 also prescribes a time period for bringing such an action and authorizes a court to
61 award reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs to the successful plaintiff in such a suit.
62 Existing law provides identical authority to bring such a lawsuit or seek injunctive relief for
63 violations of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS 241.037)] clarifies that any such action is also
64 unenforceable.
65 Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees to pay the
66 cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions necessitated or attributable
67 to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under existing law, a local government that
68 wishes to impose an impact fee is required to set a public hearing to consider the land use
69 assumptions and to provide certain notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5
70 of this bill requires copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
71 commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of businesses that are
72 likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.

4 whether the proposed regulation is likely to:
5 (a) Impose a direct and significant economic burden upon a small business; or
6 (b) Directly restrict the formation, operation or expansion of a small business.
7 2. If an agency determines pursuant to subsection 1 that a proposed regulation
8 is likely to impose a direct and significant economic burden upon a small business
9 or directly restrict the formation, operation or expansion of a small business, the
10 agency shall:
11 (a) Insofar as practicable, consult with owners and officers of small businesses
12 that are likely to be affected by the proposed regulation.

20 consultant or other independent contractor who has such knowledge and is retained
21 by the agency.
22 [(c)] (d) Consider methods to reduce the impact of the proposed regulation on
23 small businesses, including, without limitation:
24 (1) Simplifying the proposed regulation;

39 contained in the statement is accurate.

41 pursuant to NRS 233B.067 must be accompanied by a copy of the small business

42 (a) In writing to each person who has requested to be placed on a mailing list;

52 by the proposed regulation and requests an oral hearing, the agency may proceed

1 immediately to act upon any written submissions. The agency shall consider fully
2 all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed regulation.
3 4. An agency shall not hold the public hearing required pursuant to subsection
4 3 on the same day that the agency holds the workshop required pursuant to
5 subsection 2.
6 5. Each workshop and public hearing required pursuant to subsections 2 and 3
