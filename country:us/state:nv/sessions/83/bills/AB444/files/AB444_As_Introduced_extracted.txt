AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions relating to the adoption of regulations by
certain agencies of the Executive Department of the State
Government; revising provisions relating to the adoption
by a governing body of a local government of certain
ordinances or the taking of certain actions relating to fees
paid by businesses; authorizing certain legal actions to be
taken for certain violations relating to the adoption of
such ordinances or taking of such actions by a governing
body of a local government; revising provisions relating
to impact fees; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Administrative Procedure Act establishes procedural requirements
2 for the adoption of administrative regulations by agencies, officers and employees
3 of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
4 (NRS 233B.010-233B.120) Under the Act, such state agencies, officers and
5 employees are required to take certain actions to determine the impact of a
6 proposed regulation on for-profit businesses that employ less than 150 employees
7 before adopting a regulation that is likely to impose a direct and significant
8 economic burden upon such a small business or that directly restricts the formation,
9 operation or expansion of such a small business. (NRS 233B.0382, 233B.0608) The
10 Act further requires that after such actions are taken, the state agency, officer or
11 employee is required to prepare a small business impact statement and prescribes
12 the information required to be included in the statement. (NRS 233B.0608,
13 233B.0609) Existing law also establishes procedural requirements for the adoption
14 by a local government of a rule, which is defined in existing law to mean an
15 ordinance and, with certain exceptions, an action taken that imposes, increases or
16 changes the basis for the calculation of a fee that is paid by a for-profit business.

17 (NRS 237.030-237.150) One of the procedural prerequisites for the adoption by a
18 local government of such a rule that is likely to impose a direct and significant
19 economic burden upon a business or directly restricts the formation, operation or
20 expansion of a business is the notification of chambers of commerce and trade
21 associations of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.080) Existing law requires inclusion in
22 the business impact statement prepared by the local government regarding such a
23 proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be affected by the proposed
24 rule; and (2) a list of the chambers of commerce and trade associations notified of
25 the proposed rule. (NRS 237.090) Section 1 of this bill imposes the same
26 prerequisite of notifying chambers of commerce and trade associations on a state
27 agency, officer or employee subject to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act, in
28 determining the impact of a proposed regulation on small businesses, insofar as is
29 practicable. Section 2 of this bill similarly requires the state agency, officer or
30 employee to include in the small business impact statement for the proposed
31 regulation the total number of small businesses likely to be affected by the
32 proposed regulation and a list of any chambers of commerce and trade associations
33 notified pursuant to section 1.
34 Under existing law, a local government is not required to comply with the
35 procedural requirements for adopting a rule if the local government is taking action
36 that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of sales and use
37 taxes. (NRS 237.060) Section 3 of this bill eliminates this exemption, thereby
38 requiring a local government to comply with those procedural requirements with
39 respect to a proposed rule that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the
40 calculation of sales and use taxes. Section 3 also clarifies that, for purposes of the
41 procedural requirements for adopting a rule, a “rule” is either: (1) an ordinance by
42 the adoption of which the governing body of a local government exercises
43 legislative powers; or (2) an action taken by the governing body of a local
44 government that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of a fee
45 that is paid in whole or in substantial part by businesses. (See, e.g., Castellanos v.
46 City of Reno, 629 F. Supp. 3d 1031, 1042 (D. Nev. 2022) (construing NRS 237.060
47 “as disjunctive because the alternative is contrary to common sense and the law’s
48 purpose”))
49 Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a
50 proposed rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void.
51 (NRS 237.140) Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General and certain
52 persons to sue in a court of competent jurisdiction: (1) to have any action to adopt a
53 proposed rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule declared
54 void; or (2) for an injunction against the local government to require compliance
55 with or prevent violations of the requirements for adopting such a rule. Section 4
56 also prescribes a time period for bringing such an action and authorizes a court to
57 award reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs to the successful plaintiff in such a
58 suit. Existing law provides identical authority to bring such a lawsuit or seek
59 injunctive relief for violations of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS 241.037)
60 Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees
61 to pay the cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions
62 necessitated or attributable to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under
63 existing law, a local government that wishes to impose an impact fee is required to
64 set a public hearing to consider the land use assumptions and to provide certain
65 notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5 of this bill requires
66 copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
67 commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of
68 businesses that are likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.
