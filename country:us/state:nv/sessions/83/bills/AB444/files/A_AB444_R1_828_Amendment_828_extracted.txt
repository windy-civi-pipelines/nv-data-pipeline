FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising provisions relating to
the adoption of regulations by certain agencies of the Executive
Department of the State Government; revising provisions relating to
the adoption by a governing body of a local government of certain
ordinances or the taking of certain actions relating to fees paid by
businesses; revising provisions relating to impact fees; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Administrative Procedure Act establishes procedural requirements for the
2 adoption of administrative regulations by agencies, officers and employees of the Executive
3 Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions. (NRS 233B.010-233B.120)
4 Under the Act, such state agencies, officers and employees are required to take certain actions
5 to determine the impact of a proposed regulation on for-profit businesses that employ less than
6 150 employees before adopting a regulation that is likely to impose a direct and significant
7 economic burden upon such a small business or that directly restricts the formation, operation
8 or expansion of such a small business. (NRS 233B.0382, 233B.0608) The Act further requires
9 that after such actions are taken, the state agency, officer or employee is required to prepare a
10 small business impact statement and prescribes the information required to be included in the
11 statement. (NRS 233B.0608, 233B.0609) The Act also requires that an agency, before holding
12 an initial public hearing on a proposed regulation, conduct at least one workshop to solicit
13 comments from interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the
14 regulation. (NRS 233B.061) Existing law also establishes procedural requirements for the
15 adoption by a local government of a rule, which is defined in existing law to mean an
16 ordinance and, with certain exceptions, an action taken that imposes, increases or changes the
17 basis for the calculation of a fee that is paid by a for-profit business. (NRS 237.030-237.150)
18 One of the procedural prerequisites for the adoption by a local government of such a rule that
19 is likely to impose a direct and significant economic burden upon a business or directly
20 restricts the formation, operation or expansion of a business is the notification of chambers of
21 commerce and trade associations of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.080) Existing law requires
22 inclusion in the business impact statement prepared by the local government regarding such a
Assembly Amendment No. 828 to Assembly Bill No. 444 First Reprint Page 4
23 proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be affected by the proposed rule; and (2)
24 a list of the chambers of commerce and trade associations notified of the proposed rule. (NRS
25 237.090) Section 1 of this bill imposes the same prerequisite of notifying chambers of
26 commerce and trade associations on a state agency, officer or employee subject to the Nevada
27 Administrative Procedure Act, in determining the impact of a proposed regulation on small
28 businesses, insofar as is practicable. Section 2 of this bill similarly requires the state agency,
29 officer or employee to include in the small business impact statement for the proposed
30 regulation the total number of small businesses likely to be affected by the proposed
31 regulation and a list of any chambers of commerce and trade associations notified pursuant to
32 section 1. Section 2.5 of this bill requires an agency to notify by electronic mail chambers of
33 commerce, trade associations or owners and officers of businesses which are likely be affected
34 by a proposed regulation of the time and place set for a workshop to solicit comments from
35 interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the regulation. Section 2.5
36 also requires an agency to maintain an electronic mailing list of local chambers of commerce,
37 trade associations and owners and officers of businesses and to update the list not later than
38 January 31 of each year.
39 Under existing law, a local government is not required to comply with the procedural
40 requirements for adopting a rule if the local government is taking action that imposes,
41 increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee or sales and use taxes. (NRS
42 237.060) Section 3 of this bill eliminates these exemptions, thereby requiring a local
43 government to comply with those procedural requirements with respect to a proposed rule that
44 imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee or sales and use
45 taxes. [Section 3 also clarifies that, for purposes of the procedural requirements for adopting a
46 rule, a “rule” is either: (1) an ordinance by the adoption of which the governing body of a
47 local government exercises legislative powers; or (2) an action taken by the governing body of
48 a local government that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of a fee
49 that is paid in whole or in substantial part by businesses. (See, e.g., Castellanos v. City of
50 Reno, 629 F. Supp. 3d 1031, 1042 (D. Nev. 2022) (construing NRS 237.060 “as disjunctive
51 because the alternative is contrary to common sense and the law’s purpose”))]
52 Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a proposed
53 rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void. (NRS 237.140) Section 4
54 of this bill clarifies that any such action is also unenforceable.
55 Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees to pay the
56 cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions necessitated or attributable
57 to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under existing law, a local government that
58 wishes to impose an impact fee is required to set a public hearing to consider the land use
59 assumptions and to provide certain notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5
60 of this bill requires copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
61 commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of businesses that are
62 likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

4 whether the proposed regulation is likely to:
5 (a) Impose a direct and significant economic burden upon a small business; or
6 (b) Directly restrict the formation, operation or expansion of a small business.
7 2. If an agency determines pursuant to subsection 1 that a proposed regulation
8 is likely to impose a direct and significant economic burden upon a small business
9 or directly restrict the formation, operation or expansion of a small business, the
10 agency shall:

13 small businesses, including, without limitation:
14 (1) Simplifying the proposed regulation;

17 business is authorized to pay a lower fee or fine.
18 [(d)] (e) Prepare a small business impact statement and make copies of the
19 statement available to the public not less than 15 days before the workshop
20 conducted and the public hearing held pursuant to NRS 233B.061. A copy of the

27 the best of his or her knowledge or belief, a concerted effort was made to determine
28 the impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses and that the information
29 contained in the statement is accurate.
30 4. Each adopted regulation which is submitted to the Legislative Counsel
31 pursuant to NRS 233B.067 must be accompanied by a copy of the small business
32 impact statement and the statement made pursuant to subsection 3. If the agency
33 revises a regulation after preparing the small business impact statement and the
34 statement made pursuant to subsection 3, the agency must include an explanation of
35 the revision and the effect of the change on small businesses.
36 Sec. 2. NRS 233B.0609 is hereby amended to read as follows:

41 which other interested persons may obtain a copy of the summary.
42 (b) The total number of small businesses likely to be affected by the proposed
43 regulation.
44 (c) A list of the chambers of commerce and trade associations notified of the

48 subsection 2 of NRS 233B.0608 was conducted.

Assembly Amendment No. 828 to Assembly Bill No. 444 First Reprint Page 6
1 [(d)] (f) A description of the methods that the agency considered to reduce the
2 impact of the proposed regulation on small businesses and a statement regarding
3 whether the agency actually used any of those methods.
4 [(e)] (g) The estimated cost to the agency for enforcement of the proposed
5 regulation.

11 explanation of why such duplicative or more stringent provisions are necessary.
12 [(h)] (j) The reasons for the conclusions of the agency regarding the impact of
13 a regulation on small businesses.
14 2. The director, executive head or other person who is responsible for the

16 his or her knowledge or belief, the information contained in the statement was
17 prepared properly and is accurate.
18 Sec. 2.5. NRS 233B.061 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 233B.061 1. All interested persons must be afforded a reasonable
20 opportunity to submit data, views or arguments upon a proposed regulation, orally
21 or in writing.
22 2. Before holding the public hearing required pursuant to subsection 3, an
23 agency shall conduct at least one workshop to solicit comments from interested
24 persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in a proposed regulation,
25 except that a workshop is not required if it is the second or subsequent hearing on
26 the regulation. Not less than 15 days before the workshop, the agency shall provide
27 notice of the time and place set for the workshop:
28 (a) In writing to each person who has requested to be placed on a mailing list;
29 [and]
30 (b) By electronic mail to chambers of commerce, trade associations or

39 immediately to act upon any written submissions. The agency shall consider fully
40 all written and oral submissions respecting the proposed regulation.
41 4. An agency shall not hold the public hearing required pursuant to subsection
42 3 on the same day that the agency holds the workshop required pursuant to
43 subsection 2.
44 5. Each workshop and public hearing required pursuant to subsections 2 and 3
45 must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 241 of NRS.
46 6. The agency shall maintain an electronic mailing list of chambers of

50 commerce and trade association by electronic mail regardless of whether the
51 chamber of commerce or trade association has requested that it be placed on the
52 electronic mailing list. Nothing in this section prohibits the agency from also
53 providing notification pursuant to this section by mail.

AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising provisions relating to

23 proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be affected by the proposed rule; and (2)
24 a list of the chambers of commerce and trade associations notified of the proposed rule. (NRS
25 237.090) Section 1 of this bill imposes the same prerequisite of notifying chambers of

30 regulation the total number of small businesses likely to be affected by the proposed
31 regulation and a list of any chambers of commerce and trade associations notified pursuant to
32 section 1. Section 2.5 of this bill requires an agency to notify by electronic mail chambers of
33 commerce, trade associations or owners and officers of businesses which are likely be affected
34 by a proposed regulation of the time and place set for a workshop to solicit comments from
35 interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the regulation. Section 2.5
36 also requires an agency to maintain an electronic mailing list of local chambers of commerce,

51 because the alternative is contrary to common sense and the law’s purpose”))]
52 Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a proposed
53 rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void. (NRS 237.140) Section 4
54 of this bill clarifies that any such action is also unenforceable.
55 Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees to pay the
56 cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions necessitated or attributable
57 to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under existing law, a local government that
58 wishes to impose an impact fee is required to set a public hearing to consider the land use
59 assumptions and to provide certain notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5
60 of this bill requires copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
61 commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of businesses that are
62 likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.
