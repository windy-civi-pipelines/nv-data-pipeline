administration. (BDR 18-772)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions relating to the adoption of regulations by
certain agencies of the Executive Department of the State
Government; revising provisions relating to the adoption
by a governing body of a local government of certain
ordinances or the taking of certain actions relating to fees
paid by businesses; revising provisions relating to impact
fees; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Administrative Procedure Act establishes procedural requirements
2 for the adoption of administrative regulations by agencies, officers and employees
3 of the Executive Department of the State Government, with certain exceptions.
4 (NRS 233B.010-233B.120) Under the Act, such state agencies, officers and
5 employees are required to take certain actions to determine the impact of a
6 proposed regulation on for-profit businesses that employ less than 150 employees
7 before adopting a regulation that is likely to impose a direct and significant
8 economic burden upon such a small business or that directly restricts the formation,
9 operation or expansion of such a small business. (NRS 233B.0382, 233B.0608) The
10 Act further requires that after such actions are taken, the state agency, officer or
11 employee is required to prepare a small business impact statement and prescribes
12 the information required to be included in the statement. (NRS 233B.0608,
13 233B.0609) The Act also requires that an agency, before holding an initial public
14 hearing on a proposed regulation, conduct at least one workshop to solicit
15 comments from interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in
16 the regulation. (NRS 233B.061) Existing law also establishes procedural
-

17 requirements for the adoption by a local government of a rule, which is defined in
18 existing law to mean an ordinance and, with certain exceptions, an action taken that
19 imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of a fee that is paid by a
20 for-profit business. (NRS 237.030-237.150) One of the procedural prerequisites for
21 the adoption by a local government of such a rule that is likely to impose a direct
22 and significant economic burden upon a business or directly restricts the formation,
23 operation or expansion of a business is the notification of chambers of commerce
24 and trade associations of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.080) Existing law requires
25 inclusion in the business impact statement prepared by the local government
26 regarding such a proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be affected
27 by the proposed rule; and (2) a list of the chambers of commerce and trade
28 associations notified of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.090) Section 1 of this bill
29 imposes the same prerequisite of notifying chambers of commerce and trade
30 associations on a state agency, officer or employee subject to the Nevada
31 Administrative Procedure Act, in determining the impact of a proposed regulation
32 on small businesses, insofar as is practicable. Section 2 of this bill similarly
33 requires the state agency, officer or employee to include in the small business
34 impact statement for the proposed regulation the total number of small businesses
35 likely to be affected by the proposed regulation and a list of any chambers of
36 commerce and trade associations notified pursuant to section 1. Section 2.5 of this
37 bill requires an agency to notify by electronic mail chambers of commerce, trade
38 associations or owners and officers of businesses which are likely be affected by a
39 proposed regulation of the time and place set for a workshop to solicit comments
40 from interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the
41 regulation. Section 2.5 also requires an agency to maintain an electronic mailing
42 list of local chambers of commerce, trade associations and owners and officers of
43 businesses and to update the list not later than January 31 of each year.
44 Under existing law, a local government is not required to comply with the
45 procedural requirements for adopting a rule if the local government is taking action
46 that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee or
47 sales and use taxes. (NRS 237.060) Section 3 of this bill eliminates these
48 exemptions, thereby requiring a local government to comply with those procedural
49 requirements with respect to a proposed rule that imposes, increases or changes the
50 basis for the calculation of an impact fee or sales and use taxes.
51 Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a
52 proposed rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void.
53 (NRS 237.140) Section 4 of this bill clarifies that any such action is also
54 unenforceable.
55 Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees
56 to pay the cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions
57 necessitated or attributable to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under
58 existing law, a local government that wishes to impose an impact fee is required to
59 set a public hearing to consider the land use assumptions and to provide certain
60 notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5 of this bill requires
61 copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
62 commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of
63 businesses that are likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.

17 requirements for the adoption by a local government of a rule, which is defined in
18 existing law to mean an ordinance and, with certain exceptions, an action taken that
19 imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of a fee that is paid by a
20 for-profit business. (NRS 237.030-237.150) One of the procedural prerequisites for
21 the adoption by a local government of such a rule that is likely to impose a direct
22 and significant economic burden upon a business or directly restricts the formation,
23 operation or expansion of a business is the notification of chambers of commerce
24 and trade associations of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.080) Existing law requires
25 inclusion in the business impact statement prepared by the local government
26 regarding such a proposed rule: (1) the number of businesses likely to be affected
27 by the proposed rule; and (2) a list of the chambers of commerce and trade
28 associations notified of the proposed rule. (NRS 237.090) Section 1 of this bill
29 imposes the same prerequisite of notifying chambers of commerce and trade
30 associations on a state agency, officer or employee subject to the Nevada
31 Administrative Procedure Act, in determining the impact of a proposed regulation
32 on small businesses, insofar as is practicable. Section 2 of this bill similarly
33 requires the state agency, officer or employee to include in the small business
34 impact statement for the proposed regulation the total number of small businesses
35 likely to be affected by the proposed regulation and a list of any chambers of
36 commerce and trade associations notified pursuant to section 1. Section 2.5 of this
37 bill requires an agency to notify by electronic mail chambers of commerce, trade
38 associations or owners and officers of businesses which are likely be affected by a
39 proposed regulation of the time and place set for a workshop to solicit comments
40 from interested persons on one or more general topics to be addressed in the
41 regulation. Section 2.5 also requires an agency to maintain an electronic mailing
42 list of local chambers of commerce, trade associations and owners and officers of
43 businesses and to update the list not later than January 31 of each year.
44 Under existing law, a local government is not required to comply with the
45 procedural requirements for adopting a rule if the local government is taking action
46 that imposes, increases or changes the basis for the calculation of an impact fee or
47 sales and use taxes. (NRS 237.060) Section 3 of this bill eliminates these
48 exemptions, thereby requiring a local government to comply with those procedural
49 requirements with respect to a proposed rule that imposes, increases or changes the
50 basis for the calculation of an impact fee or sales and use taxes.
51 Existing law further provides that any action of a local government to adopt a
52 proposed rule in violation of the requirements for adopting such a rule is void.
53 (NRS 237.140) Section 4 of this bill clarifies that any such action is also
54 unenforceable.
55 Existing law authorizes local governments to impose by ordinance impact fees
56 to pay the cost of constructing a capital improvement or facility expansions
57 necessitated or attributable to certain new development. (NRS 278B.160) Under
58 existing law, a local government that wishes to impose an impact fee is required to
59 set a public hearing to consider the land use assumptions and to provide certain
60 notice of such a public hearing. (NRS 278B.180) Section 5 of this bill requires
61 copies of such notice be provided, insofar as is practicable, to chambers of
62 commerce and trade associations whose members are owners or officers of
63 businesses that are likely to be affected by the proposed impact fee.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Section 1. NRS 233B.0608 is hereby amended to read as
