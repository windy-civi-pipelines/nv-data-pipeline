2 adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and adopt rules and regulations
3 relating to the community. (NRS 116.3102) This bill: (1) authorizes an association to install

7 elements after complying with certain requirements; and (3) provides that the installation and
8 maintenance of an electric vehicle charging station [in a] on the common [area] elements
9 shall be deemed not to constitute a change in use of the common [area,] elements, a
10 commercial use of the common [area] elements or a capital improvement.
