EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to common-interest communities; enacting provisions relating to
the installation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging stations
within a common-interest community; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest community to
2 adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and adopt rules and regulations
3 relating to the community. (NRS 116.3102) [This bill prohibits the executive board and the
4 governing documents of an association from prohibiting a unit’s owner or occupant from
5 installing or maintaining an electric vehicle charging station within the physical portion of the
6 common-interest community that the unit’s owner or occupant has a right to occupy and use
7 exclusively.] This bill : [also:] (1) authorizes an association to install an electric vehicle
8 charging station in a common area under certain circumstances; (2) authorizes an association
9 to enter into a necessary contract for the installation or maintenance of an electric vehicle
10 charging station in a common area [;] after complying with certain requirements; and (3)
11 provides that the installation and maintenance of an electric vehicle charging station in a
12 common area shall be deemed not to constitute a change in use of the common area, a
13 commercial use of the common area or a capital improvement.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 116 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. [Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the executive board shall
4 not and the governing documents must not prohibit a unit’s owner or an
5 occupant of a unit from installing or maintaining an electric vehicle charging
6 station within such physical portion of the common-interest community as the
7 owner or occupant has a right to occupy and use exclusively.
8 2.] Notwithstanding any provision in the governing documents to the
9 contrary:

Senate Amendment No. 532 to Senate Bill No. 152 Page 4
1 (a) An association may [, without seeking or obtaining approval from the
2 units’ owners,] install an electric vehicle charging station in a common area if:
3 (1) The location in the common area is not being used for recreation,
4 including, without limitation, being used as a park, playground or open play
5 space; [and]
6 (2) A majority of the units’ owners, whether present in person or by
7 proxy, do not reject the proposed electric vehicle charging station by vote at a
8 regular meeting of the executive board where the installation of the proposed
9 electric vehicle charging station is an agenda item listed for discussion;
10 (3) The association complies with the provisions of subsection 3 of NRS
11 116.345; and
12 (4) Placement of the electric vehicle charging station in that location
13 does not increase any cost to any unit owner or violate any applicable zoning
14 ordinance, permit or approval.
15 (b) An association may, [without seeking or obtaining approval from the
16 units’ owners,] after complying with the provisions of subparagraphs (1) to (4),
17 inclusive, of paragraph (a), enter into any necessary contract with any person for
18 the installation or maintenance of an electric vehicle charging station in a
19 common area.
20 (c) The installation and maintenance of an electric vehicle charging station
21 in a common area shall be deemed not to constitute:
22 (1) A change in use of the common area;
23 (2) A commercial use of the common area; or
24 (3) A capital improvement.
25 [3. The provisions of this section do not preclude an association from
26 adopting, and do not preclude the governing documents of an association from
27 setting forth, rules and regulations that reasonably restrict the placement of an
28 electric vehicle charging station.
29 4.] 2. As used in this section, “electric vehicle charging station” means a
30 station that delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into one
31 or more electric vehicles. The term includes, without limitation, an electric
32 vehicle charging station where several charge points simultaneously connect
