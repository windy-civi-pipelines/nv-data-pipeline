AN ACT relating to common-interest communities; enacting

2 community to adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend bylaws and
3 adopt rules and regulations relating to the community. (NRS 116.3102) This bill
4 prohibits the executive board and the governing documents of an association from
5 prohibiting a unit’s owner or occupant from installing or maintaining an electric
6 vehicle charging station within the physical portion of the common-interest
7 community that the unit’s owner or occupant has a right to occupy and use
8 exclusively. This bill also: (1) authorizes an association to install an electric vehicle
9 charging station in a common area under certain circumstances; (2) authorizes an
10 association to enter into a necessary contract for the installation or maintenance of
11 an electric vehicle charging station in a common area; and (3) provides that the
12 installation and maintenance of an electric vehicle charging station in a common
13 area shall be deemed not to constitute a change in use of the common area, a
14 commercial use of the common area or a capital improvement.
