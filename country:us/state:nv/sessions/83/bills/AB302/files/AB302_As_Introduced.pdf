Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a minor who is a witness in certain criminal cases to
2 designate an attendant who must be allowed to attend the preliminary hearing and
3 the trial during the witness’s testimony to provide support. (NRS 178.571) Section
4 1 of this bill requires the court in a criminal proceeding or proceeding relating to
5 abuse or neglect to allow a witness who is a minor or vulnerable person to use a
6 facility dog, if available, to provide support during the witness’s testimony, unless
7 the court finds that doing so will unduly prejudice the defendant or interfere with a
8 constitutional right of the defendant. Section 1 also prescribes certain requirements
9 relating to facility dogs.
10 In general, existing law requires a place of public accommodation, common
11 carrier or other means of public conveyance or transportation to admit a person
12 accompanied by a service animal or service animal in training. (NRS 651.075,
13 704.145, 706.366) Sections 2-4 of this bill likewise generally require a place of
14 public accommodation, common carrier or other means of public conveyance or
