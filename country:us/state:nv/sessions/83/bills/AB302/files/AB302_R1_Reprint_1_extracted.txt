AN ACT relating to facility dogs; authorizing a court to allow a
witness to use a facility dog to provide support while the
witness is testifying under certain circumstances;
requiring a county or municipality to permit a facility dog
to enter certain buildings or structures owned or leased by
the county or municipality under certain circumstances;

3 the trial during the witness’s testimony to provide support. (NRS 178.571) Section
4 1.2 of this bill authorizes the court in a criminal proceeding or proceeding relating
5 to abuse or neglect to allow a witness who is a minor or vulnerable person to use a
6 facility dog to provide support during the witness’s testimony. Section 1.2 also
7 prescribes the: (1) procedure governing a request to use a facility dog; (2) findings
8 the court must make before approving the use of a facility dog; and (3) measures
9 the court must take to ensure that the use of a facility dog does not prejudice the
10 defendant or disrupt the proceedings.
11 Under section 1.4 of this bill, upon the issuance of an order pursuant to section
12 1.2, a facility dog must be permitted to enter a courthouse or similar facility to

14 any other building or structure owned or leased by the county or municipality that
15 the court deems appropriate for purposes of preparing the witness. Section 1.4
16 further: (1) authorizes a county or municipality to exclude a facility dog and its
17 handler from such a building or structure if the conduct of the facility dog or its
18 handler after entry warrants exclusion; and (2) provides immunity from liability for
19 any injury or loss resulting from the presence or conduct of a facility dog on
20 property owned or leased by the county or municipality.
