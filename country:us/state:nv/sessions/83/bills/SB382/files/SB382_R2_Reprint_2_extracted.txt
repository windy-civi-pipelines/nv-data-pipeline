AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing certain trailers used for
farm purposes to be registered for a 5-year period in lieu
of a 12-month period; requiring a person who elects to

commensurate with the 5-year period; authorizing

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the
2 highways of this State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years
3 with the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and
4 a governmental services tax, the amount of which is based on the value of the
5 trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205, 482.206, 482.2065) Section 1 of this bill
6 authorizes a person who owns a trailer that is primarily used for farm purposes to
7 instead register the trailer for a period of 5 years. Section 1 requires a person who
8 registers a trailer for a 5-year period to pay upon registration all applicable fees and
9 taxes which the person would pay if the trailer was registered for 1 year and then
10 renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3 of this bill requires the trailer to be
11 taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax, for a period of 5 years.
12 Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions
13 that have been renumbered in section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the
14 expiration date of a license plate or substitute decal on a trailer that is registered for
15 a 5-year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be advanced for 5 years.
16 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a personalized
17 prestige license plate issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for
18 and renewable after 5 years, rather than 12 months.

19 Existing law prescribes certain requirements with respect to the registration,
20 testing and operation of autonomous vehicles in this State. (Chapter 482A of NRS
21 482A.010-482A.220) Existing law prohibits certain autonomous vehicles from
22 being tested or operated on a highway within this State with a human operator,
23 unless the autonomous vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the
24 applicable motor vehicle and traffic laws of this State and is equipped with certain
25 equipment, including an indicator located inside of the autonomous vehicle which
26 indicates when an automated driving system is operating the vehicle. (NRS
27 482A.080) Section 5.7 of this bill authorizes any autonomous vehicle that is tested
28 or operated within this State to be equipped with one or more automated driving
29 system marker lamps which: (1) indicate to others outside of an autonomous
30 vehicle that an automated driving system is operating the vehicle; and (2) are
31 equipped in accordance with certain nationally recognized standards applicable to
32 such equipment.

Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to vehicles.
(BDR 43-316)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing certain trailers used for
farm purposes to be registered for a 5-year period in lieu
of a 12-month period; requiring a person who elects to
register such a trailer for a 5-year period to pay fees
commensurate with the 5-year period; authorizing
autonomous vehicles to be equipped with certain marker
lamps which indicate that an automated driving system is
operating the autonomous vehicle; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the
2 highways of this State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years
3 with the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and
4 a governmental services tax, the amount of which is based on the value of the
5 trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205, 482.206, 482.2065) Section 1 of this bill
6 authorizes a person who owns a trailer that is primarily used for farm purposes to
7 instead register the trailer for a period of 5 years. Section 1 requires a person who
8 registers a trailer for a 5-year period to pay upon registration all applicable fees and
9 taxes which the person would pay if the trailer was registered for 1 year and then
10 renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3 of this bill requires the trailer to be
11 taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax, for a period of 5 years.
12 Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions
13 that have been renumbered in section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the
14 expiration date of a license plate or substitute decal on a trailer that is registered for
15 a 5-year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be advanced for 5 years.
16 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a personalized
17 prestige license plate issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for
18 and renewable after 5 years, rather than 12 months.

19 Existing law prescribes certain requirements with respect to the registration,
20 testing and operation of autonomous vehicles in this State. (Chapter 482A of NRS
21 482A.010-482A.220) Existing law prohibits certain autonomous vehicles from
22 being tested or operated on a highway within this State with a human operator,
23 unless the autonomous vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the
24 applicable motor vehicle and traffic laws of this State and is equipped with certain
25 equipment, including an indicator located inside of the autonomous vehicle which
26 indicates when an automated driving system is operating the vehicle. (NRS
27 482A.080) Section 5.7 of this bill authorizes any autonomous vehicle that is tested
28 or operated within this State to be equipped with one or more automated driving
29 system marker lamps which: (1) indicate to others outside of an autonomous
30 vehicle that an automated driving system is operating the vehicle; and (2) are
31 equipped in accordance with certain nationally recognized standards applicable to
32 such equipment.

30 Department, its agent or the registered dealer shall credit the portion
31 of the tax paid on the first vehicle attributable to the remainder of
32 the current registration period or calendar year on a pro rata monthly
33 basis against the tax due on the second vehicle or on any other
34 vehicle of which the person is the registered owner. If any person
35 transfers ownership or interest in two or more vehicles, the
36 Department or the registered dealer shall credit the portion of the tax
37 paid on all of the vehicles attributable to the remainder of the
38 current registration period or calendar year on a pro rata monthly
39 basis against the tax due on the vehicle to which the registration is
40 transferred or on any other vehicle of which the person is the
41 registered owner. The certificates of registration and unused license
42 plates of the vehicles from which a person transfers ownership or
43 interest must be submitted before credit is given against the tax due

2 agent or the registered dealer shall credit the portion of the
3 registration fee paid on each vehicle attributable to the remainder of
