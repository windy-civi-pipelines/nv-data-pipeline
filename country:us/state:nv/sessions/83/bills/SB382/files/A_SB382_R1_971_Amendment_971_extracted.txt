EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing certain trailers used for farm purposes to
be registered for a 5-year period in lieu of a 12-month period; requiring
a person who elects to register such a trailer for a 5-year period to pay
fees commensurate with the 5-year period; authorizing autonomous
vehicles to be equipped with certain marker lamps which indicate
that an automated driving system is operating the autonomous
vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the highways of this
2 State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years with the Department of
3 Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and a governmental services tax, the
4 amount of which is based on the value of the trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205,
5 482.206, 482.2065) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a person who owns a trailer that is
6 primarily used for farm purposes to instead register the trailer for a period of 5 years. Section
7 1 requires a person who registers a trailer for a 5-year period to pay upon registration all
8 applicable fees and taxes which the person would pay if the trailer was registered for 1 year
9 and then renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3 of this bill requires the trailer to be
10 taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax, for a period of 5 years. Sections 4.5 and
11 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in
12 section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the expiration date of a license plate or substitute
13 decal on a trailer that is registered for a 5-year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be
14 advanced for 5 years. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a
15 personalized prestige license plate issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for
16 and renewable after 5 years, rather than 12 months.
17 Existing law prescribes certain requirements with respect to the registration, testing
18 and operation of autonomous vehicles in this State. (Chapter 482A of NRS 482A.010-
19 482A.220) Existing law prohibits certain autonomous vehicles from being tested or
20 operated on a highway within this State with a human operator, unless the autonomous
21 vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the applicable motor vehicle and
22 traffic laws of this State and is equipped with certain equipment, including an indicator
23 located inside of the autonomous vehicle which indicates when an automated driving
24 system is operating the vehicle. (NRS 482A.080) Section 5.5 of this bill authorizes any
25 autonomous vehicle that is tested or operated within this State to be equipped with one
26 or more automated driving system marker lamps which: (1) indicate to others outside of
Assembly Amendment No. 971 to Senate Bill No. 382 First Reprint Page 4
27 an autonomous vehicle that an automated driving system is operating the vehicle; and
28 (2) are equipped in accordance with certain nationally recognized standards applicable
29 to such equipment.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to [the registration of trailers.] vehicles.
(BDR 43-316)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing certain trailers used for farm purposes to
be registered for a 5-year period in lieu of a 12-month period; requiring
a person who elects to register such a trailer for a 5-year period to pay
fees commensurate with the 5-year period; authorizing autonomous
vehicles to be equipped with certain marker lamps which indicate
that an automated driving system is operating the autonomous
vehicle; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the highways of this
2 State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years with the Department of
3 Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and a governmental services tax, the
4 amount of which is based on the value of the trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205,
5 482.206, 482.2065) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a person who owns a trailer that is
6 primarily used for farm purposes to instead register the trailer for a period of 5 years. Section
7 1 requires a person who registers a trailer for a 5-year period to pay upon registration all
8 applicable fees and taxes which the person would pay if the trailer was registered for 1 year
9 and then renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3 of this bill requires the trailer to be
10 taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax, for a period of 5 years. Sections 4.5 and
11 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in
12 section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the expiration date of a license plate or substitute
13 decal on a trailer that is registered for a 5-year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be
14 advanced for 5 years. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a
15 personalized prestige license plate issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for
16 and renewable after 5 years, rather than 12 months.
17 Existing law prescribes certain requirements with respect to the registration, testing
18 and operation of autonomous vehicles in this State. (Chapter 482A of NRS 482A.010-
19 482A.220) Existing law prohibits certain autonomous vehicles from being tested or
20 operated on a highway within this State with a human operator, unless the autonomous
21 vehicle is capable of operating in compliance with the applicable motor vehicle and
22 traffic laws of this State and is equipped with certain equipment, including an indicator
23 located inside of the autonomous vehicle which indicates when an automated driving
24 system is operating the vehicle. (NRS 482A.080) Section 5.5 of this bill authorizes any
25 autonomous vehicle that is tested or operated within this State to be equipped with one
26 or more automated driving system marker lamps which: (1) indicate to others outside of

Assembly Amendment No. 971 to Senate Bill No. 382 First Reprint Page 4
27 an autonomous vehicle that an automated driving system is operating the vehicle; and
28 (2) are equipped in accordance with certain nationally recognized standards applicable
29 to such equipment.

44 3. In computing the governmental services tax, the Department, its agent or
45 the registered dealer shall credit the portion of the tax paid on the first vehicle
46 attributable to the remainder of the current registration period or calendar year on a
47 pro rata monthly basis against the tax due on the second vehicle or on any other
48 vehicle of which the person is the registered owner. If any person transfers
49 ownership or interest in two or more vehicles, the Department or the registered
50 dealer shall credit the portion of the tax paid on all of the vehicles attributable to the
51 remainder of the current registration period or calendar year on a pro rata monthly
52 basis against the tax due on the vehicle to which the registration is transferred or on
53 any other vehicle of which the person is the registered owner. The certificates of

Assembly Amendment No. 971 to Senate Bill No. 382 First Reprint Page 9
1 registration and unused license plates of the vehicles from which a person transfers
2 ownership or interest must be submitted before credit is given against the tax due
3 on the vehicle to which the registration is transferred or on any other vehicle of
4 which the person is the registered owner.
5 4. In computing the registration fee, the Department or its agent or the
6 registered dealer shall credit the portion of the registration fee paid on each vehicle
7 attributable to the remainder of the current calendar year or registration period on a
8 pro rata basis against the registration fee due on the vehicle to which registration is
9 transferred.
10 5. If the amount owed on the registration fee or governmental services tax on
11 the vehicle to which registration is transferred is less than the credit on the total
12 registration fee or governmental services tax paid on all vehicles from which a
13 person transfers ownership or interest, the person may apply the unused portion of
14 the credit to the registration of any other vehicle owned by the person. Any unused
15 portion of such a credit expires on the date the registration of the vehicle from
16 which the person transferred the registration was due to expire.
17 6. If the license plate or plates are not appropriate for the second vehicle, the
18 plate or plates must be surrendered to the Department or registered dealer and an
19 appropriate plate or plates must be issued by the Department. The Department shall
20 not reissue the surrendered plate or plates until the next succeeding licensing
21 period.
22 7. If application for transfer of registration is not made within 60 days after
23 the destruction or transfer of ownership of or interest in any vehicle, the license
24 plate or plates must be surrendered to the Department on or before the 60th day for
25 cancellation of the registration.
26 8. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 of NRS 371.040, NRS
27 482.2155, subsections [8 and] 9 and 10 of NRS 482.260 and subsection 3 of NRS
28 482.483, if a person cancels his or her registration and surrenders to the Department
29 the license plates for a vehicle, the Department shall:
30 (a) In accordance with the provisions of subsection 9, issue to the person a
31 refund of the portion of the registration fee and governmental services tax paid on
32 the vehicle attributable to the remainder of the current calendar year or registration
33 period on a pro rata basis; or
34 (b) If the person does not qualify for a refund in accordance with the provisions
35 of subsection 9, issue to the person a credit in the amount of the portion of the
36 registration fee and governmental services tax paid on the vehicle attributable to the
37 remainder of the current calendar year or registration period on a pro rata basis.
38 Such a credit may be applied by the person to the registration of any other vehicle
39 owned by the person. Any unused portion of the credit expires on the date the
40 registration of the vehicle from which the person obtained a refund was due to
41 expire.
42 9. The Department shall issue a refund pursuant to subsection 8 only if the
43 request for a refund is made at the time the registration is cancelled and the license
44 plates are surrendered, the person requesting the refund is a resident of Nevada, the
45 amount eligible for refund exceeds $100, and evidence satisfactory to the
