SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the registration of trailers.
(BDR 43-316)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing [the registration of] certain [business,
commercial and farm use trailers for as long as the trailer is owned by
the person who obtained the registration; providing for a one-time
imposition of a flat governmental services tax on certain business,
commercial and farm use trailers that are registered in this manner;]
trailers used for farm purposes to be registered for a 5-year period
in lieu of a 12-month period; requiring a person who elects to
register such a trailer for a 5-year period to pay fees
commensurate with the 5-year period; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the highways of this
2 State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years with the Department of
3 Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and a governmental services tax, the
4 amount of which is based on the value of the trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205,
5 482.206, 482.2065) [Alternatively, existing law authorizes the owners of certain commercial
6 full trailers and semitrailers to obtain a permanent registration for the trailer by paying a flat
7 registration fee of $24 and a governmental services tax in the amount of $86 for a
8 nontransferable registration that remains valid for as long as the person owns the trailer or
9 until the person cancels the registration of the trailer and surrenders the license plates to the
10 Department. (NRS 371.040, 482.206, 482.260, 482.483)
11 Section 8 of this bill expands the types of trailers that are eligible for the permanent
12 registration option to include any trailer or semitrailer used for business, commercial or farm
13 purposes, other than a recreational vehicle or travel trailer. Section 8 provides that a trailer or
14 semitrailer may be registered in this manner whether or not it is part of a fleet. Sections 1-7
15 and 9 of this bill, in conformity with the change made by section 8, replaces the term “full
16 trailer” with “trailer” in existing provisions which reference the permanent registration of
17 trailers. Section 10 of this bill repeals the definition of “full trailer” for the purposes of
18 provisions governing motor vehicle registration to reflect that this term is no longer used in
19 any applicable provision of existing law.] Section 1 of this bill authorizes a person who
20 owns a trailer that is primarily used for farm purposes to instead register the trailer for
21 a period of 5 years. Section 1 requires a person who registers a trailer for a 5-year period
22 to pay upon registration all applicable fees and taxes which the person would pay if the
Senate Amendment No. 242 to Senate Bill No. 382 Page 4
23 trailer was registered for 1 year and then renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3
24 of this bill requires the trailer to be taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax,
25 for a period of 5 years. Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer
26 to provisions that have been renumbered in section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the
27 expiration date of a license plate or substitute decal on a trailer that is registered for a 5-
28 year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be advanced for 5 years. Section 5 of
29 this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a personalized prestige license plate
30 issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for and renewable after 5 years,
31 rather than 12 months.

19 (a) In accordance with the provisions of subsection 9, issue to the person a
20 refund of the portion of the registration fee and governmental services tax paid on
21 the vehicle attributable to the remainder of the current calendar year or registration
22 period on a pro rata basis; or
23 (b) If the person does not qualify for a refund in accordance with the provisions
24 of subsection 9, issue to the person a credit in the amount of the portion of the
25 registration fee and governmental services tax paid on the vehicle attributable to the
26 remainder of the current calendar year or registration period on a pro rata basis.
27 Such a credit may be applied by the person to the registration of any other vehicle

39 or otherwise disposed of his or her vehicle.
40 (b) The vehicle has been determined to be inoperable and the person does not
41 transfer the registration to a different vehicle.

43 survivors have sold or otherwise disposed of the vehicle.
44 (d) Any other event occurs which the Department, by regulation, has defined to
45 constitute an “extenuating circumstance” for the purposes of this subsection.
46 Sec. 6. [NRS 482.375 is hereby amended to read as follows:

18 expense to the State of Nevada.
19 4. The Department may adopt regulations:

22 Nevada license plate or plates.
23 (b) Setting forth the requirements and procedure for obtaining a waiver of the
24 annual fee for a renewal sticker except that an applicant for the waiver must not be
25 required to submit to the Department the statement required pursuant to paragraph
26 (a) of subsection 2 more than once.
27 5. All applications for the plates authorized by this section must be made to
28 the Department.
29 6. If, during a registration period, the holder of license plates issued pursuant
30 to this section is no longer eligible to hold the license plates pursuant to subsection
31 1, he or she shall surrender any of those license plates in his or her possession to the
32 Department and is entitled to receive regular Nevada license plates.] (Deleted by
33 amendment.)
34 Sec. 7. [NRS 482.3824 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 482.3824 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 482.38279, with respect
36 to any special license plate that is issued pursuant to NRS 482.3667 to 482.3823,
37 inclusive, and for which additional fees are imposed for the issuance of the special

39 (a) The Director shall, at the request of the charitable organization that is
40 benefited by the particular special license plate:
41 (1) Order the design and preparation of souvenir license plates, the design
42 of which must be substantially similar to the particular special license plate; and

48 after the particular special license plate is approved for issuance, issue the special
49 license plate for a trailer, motorcycle or other type of vehicle that is not a passenger
50 car or light commercial vehicle, excluding vehicles required to be registered with
51 the Department pursuant to NRS 706.801 to 706.861, inclusive, [full] trailers or

6 the Department incurs additional costs to manufacture a special license plate for
7 such other types of vehicles, including, without limitation, costs associated with the

9 manufacture the special license plate for such other types of vehicles, those

13 issues a special license plate for a trailer, motorcycle or other type of vehicle that is
14 not a passenger car or light commercial vehicle, the Department shall charge and
15 collect for the issuance and renewal of such a plate the same fees that the
16 Department would charge and collect if the other type of vehicle was a passenger
17 car or light commercial vehicle. As used in this subsection, “fees” does not include
18 any applicable registration or license fees or governmental services taxes.
19 3. As used in this section:
20 (a) “Additional fees” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 482.38273.
21 (b) “Charitable organization” means a particular cause, charity or other entity
22 that receives money from the imposition of additional fees in connection with the
23 issuance of a special license plate pursuant to NRS 482.3667 to 482.3823,
24 inclusive. The term includes:
25 (1) The successor, if any, of a charitable organization; and
26 (2) A charitable organization to which additional fees for special license
27 plates are distributed pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (c) of subsection 5
28 of NRS 482.38279.] (Deleted by amendment.)

39 nontransferable registration that does not expire until the owner transfers the
40 ownership of the [full] trailer or semitrailer, a flat nonrefundable registration fee of
41 $24. If, pursuant to NRS 482.399, the owner of a [full] trailer or semitrailer that is
42 registered pursuant to this section cancels the registration and surrenders the license
43 plates to the Department, no portion of the flat registration fee will be refunded or
44 credited to the owner. A trailer or semitrailer may be registered pursuant to this
45 subsection whether or not it is part of a fleet.] (Deleted by amendment.)
46 Sec. 9. [NRS 371.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
47 371.040 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 and 3, the annual
48 amount of the basic governmental services tax throughout the State is 4 cents on
49 each $1 of valuation of the vehicle as determined by the Department.

Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the registration of trailers.
(BDR 43-316)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing [the registration of] certain [business,
commercial and farm use trailers for as long as the trailer is owned by
the person who obtained the registration; providing for a one-time
imposition of a flat governmental services tax on certain business,
commercial and farm use trailers that are registered in this manner;]
trailers used for farm purposes to be registered for a 5-year period
in lieu of a 12-month period; requiring a person who elects to
register such a trailer for a 5-year period to pay fees
commensurate with the 5-year period; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the highways of this
2 State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years with the Department of
3 Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and a governmental services tax, the
4 amount of which is based on the value of the trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205,
5 482.206, 482.2065) [Alternatively, existing law authorizes the owners of certain commercial
6 full trailers and semitrailers to obtain a permanent registration for the trailer by paying a flat
7 registration fee of $24 and a governmental services tax in the amount of $86 for a
8 nontransferable registration that remains valid for as long as the person owns the trailer or
9 until the person cancels the registration of the trailer and surrenders the license plates to the
10 Department. (NRS 371.040, 482.206, 482.260, 482.483)
11 Section 8 of this bill expands the types of trailers that are eligible for the permanent
12 registration option to include any trailer or semitrailer used for business, commercial or farm
13 purposes, other than a recreational vehicle or travel trailer. Section 8 provides that a trailer or
14 semitrailer may be registered in this manner whether or not it is part of a fleet. Sections 1-7
15 and 9 of this bill, in conformity with the change made by section 8, replaces the term “full
16 trailer” with “trailer” in existing provisions which reference the permanent registration of
17 trailers. Section 10 of this bill repeals the definition of “full trailer” for the purposes of
18 provisions governing motor vehicle registration to reflect that this term is no longer used in
19 any applicable provision of existing law.] Section 1 of this bill authorizes a person who
20 owns a trailer that is primarily used for farm purposes to instead register the trailer for
21 a period of 5 years. Section 1 requires a person who registers a trailer for a 5-year period
22 to pay upon registration all applicable fees and taxes which the person would pay if the

Senate Amendment No. 242 to Senate Bill No. 382 Page 4
23 trailer was registered for 1 year and then renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3
24 of this bill requires the trailer to be taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax,
25 for a period of 5 years. Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer
26 to provisions that have been renumbered in section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the
27 expiration date of a license plate or substitute decal on a trailer that is registered for a 5-
28 year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be advanced for 5 years. Section 5 of
29 this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a personalized prestige license plate
30 issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for and renewable after 5 years,
31 rather than 12 months.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

8 consecutive years immediately thereafter, including, without limitation:
