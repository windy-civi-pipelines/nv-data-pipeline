EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing certain trailers used for
farm purposes to be registered for a 5-year period in lieu
of a 12-month period; requiring a person who elects to
register such a trailer for a 5-year period to pay fees
commensurate with the 5-year period; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the
2 highways of this State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years
3 with the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and
4 a governmental services tax, the amount of which is based on the value of the
5 trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205, 482.206, 482.2065) Section 1 of this bill
6 authorizes a person who owns a trailer that is primarily used for farm purposes to
7 instead register the trailer for a period of 5 years. Section 1 requires a person who
8 registers a trailer for a 5-year period to pay upon registration all applicable fees and
9 taxes which the person would pay if the trailer was registered for 1 year and then
10 renewed for 4 consecutive years, and section 3 of this bill requires the trailer to be
11 taxed, for purposes of the governmental services tax, for a period of 5 years.
12 Sections 4.5 and 5.5 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions
13 that have been renumbered in section 3. Section 1.5 of this bill requires the
14 expiration date of a license plate or substitute decal on a trailer that is registered for
15 a 5-year period, upon a transfer of the registration, to be advanced for 5 years.
16 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that a personalized
17 prestige license plate issued for a trailer registered for a 5-year period is valid for
18 and renewable after 5 years, rather than 12 months.
