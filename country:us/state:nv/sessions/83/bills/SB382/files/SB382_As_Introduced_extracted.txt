FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing the registration of certain
business, commercial and farm use trailers for as long as
the trailer is owned by the person who obtained the
registration; providing for a one-time imposition of a flat
governmental services tax on certain business,
commercial and farm use trailers that are registered in this
manner; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the
2 highways of this State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years
3 with the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and
4 a governmental services tax, the amount of which is based on the value of the
5 trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205, 482.206, 482.2065) Alternatively,
6 existing law authorizes the owners of certain commercial full trailers and
7 semitrailers to obtain a permanent registration for the trailer by paying a flat
8 registration fee of $24 and a governmental services tax in the amount of $86 for a
9 nontransferable registration that remains valid for as long as the person owns the
10 trailer or until the person cancels the registration of the trailer and surrenders the
11 license plates to the Department. (NRS 371.040, 482.206, 482.260, 482.483)
12 Section 8 of this bill expands the types of trailers that are eligible for the
13 permanent registration option to include any trailer or semitrailer used for business,
14 commercial or farm purposes, other than a recreational vehicle or travel trailer.
15 Section 8 provides that a trailer or semitrailer may be registered in this manner
16 whether or not it is part of a fleet. Sections 1-7 and 9 of this bill, in conformity
17 with the change made by section 8, replaces the term “full trailer” with “trailer” in
18 existing provisions which reference the permanent registration of trailers. Section
19 10 of this bill repeals the definition of “full trailer” for the purposes of provisions
-

20 governing motor vehicle registration to reflect that this term is no longer used in
21 any applicable provision of existing law.

S.B. 382
SENATE BILL NO. 382–SENATOR HANSEN
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the registration of
trailers. (BDR 43-316)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; authorizing the registration of certain
business, commercial and farm use trailers for as long as
the trailer is owned by the person who obtained the
registration; providing for a one-time imposition of a flat
governmental services tax on certain business,
commercial and farm use trailers that are registered in this
manner; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the owner of a trailer that is to be operated on the
2 highways of this State to register the trailer for a period of either 1 year or 3 years
3 with the Department of Motor Vehicles and pay to the Department certain fees and
4 a governmental services tax, the amount of which is based on the value of the
5 trailer. (NRS 371.030, 371.040, 482.205, 482.206, 482.2065) Alternatively,
6 existing law authorizes the owners of certain commercial full trailers and
7 semitrailers to obtain a permanent registration for the trailer by paying a flat
8 registration fee of $24 and a governmental services tax in the amount of $86 for a
9 nontransferable registration that remains valid for as long as the person owns the
10 trailer or until the person cancels the registration of the trailer and surrenders the
11 license plates to the Department. (NRS 371.040, 482.206, 482.260, 482.483)
12 Section 8 of this bill expands the types of trailers that are eligible for the
13 permanent registration option to include any trailer or semitrailer used for business,
14 commercial or farm purposes, other than a recreational vehicle or travel trailer.
15 Section 8 provides that a trailer or semitrailer may be registered in this manner
16 whether or not it is part of a fleet. Sections 1-7 and 9 of this bill, in conformity
17 with the change made by section 8, replaces the term “full trailer” with “trailer” in
18 existing provisions which reference the permanent registration of trailers. Section
19 10 of this bill repeals the definition of “full trailer” for the purposes of provisions
-

– 2 –
20 governing motor vehicle registration to reflect that this term is no longer used in
21 any applicable provision of existing law.
