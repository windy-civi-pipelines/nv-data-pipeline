SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain criminal
defendants. (BDR 14-1119)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the procedure for
evaluating certain criminal defendants whom the court
finds to be incompetent; revising provisions relating to the
involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to
certain criminal defendants; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a defendant must be competent to stand trial or
2 receive a pronouncement of judgment. (NRS 178.400) Under existing law, if the
3 court finds a defendant incompetent and certain other requirements are met: (1) the
4 judge is required to commit the defendant to the custody of the Division of Public
5 and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services for
6 detention and treatment at a secure facility of the Division; and (2) the defendant
7 must be held in such custody until the court orders the defendant’s release or until
8 the defendant is returned for trial or judgment. (NRS 178.425) Existing law
9 requires the Administrator of the Division or the Administrator’s designee to
10 periodically evaluate each such defendant and report certain information relating to
11 the competence of the defendant to the court that ordered the defendant committed.
12 (NRS 178.450) Existing law prescribes the procedure governing these evaluations.
13 (NRS 178.455) In general, section 4 of this bill revises this procedure by reducing
14 the number of evaluators the Administrator or designee is required to appoint to
15 evaluate the competence of the defendant from three evaluators to two evaluators.
16 However, if those two evaluators disagree concerning the competence of the
17 defendant, section 4 requires the Administrator or designee to appoint a third
18 evaluator to evaluate the defendant.

19 Section 1 of this bill establishes a procedure for obtaining a court order to
20 authorize the involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to a defendant
21 committed to the custody of the Division. Section 1 also requires the court to make
22 specific findings before issuing such an order. Under existing law, a court is
23 authorized to include the involuntary administration of medication in an order
24 committing a defendant to the custody of the Division. (NRS 178.425) Section 3 of
25 this bill removes this authorization and instead requires the prosecuting attorney to
26 seek a separate court order for the involuntary administration of psychiatric
27 medication using the procedure established in section 1. Section 2 of this bill
28 makes certain definitions in existing law relating to the competency of a defendant
29 applicable to section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 178 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. If the treating psychiatrist of a defendant determines that
4 psychiatric medication is necessary to restore the defendant to
5 competency and the defendant refuses to take such medication
6 voluntarily, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
7 shall:
8 (a) Submit a written report to this effect to the committing
9 court; and
10 (b) Send a copy of the written report to the prosecuting
11 attorney and the counsel for the defendant.
12 2. Upon receiving a copy of the written report submitted
13 pursuant to subsection 1, the prosecuting attorney may file a
14 motion with the court requesting a hearing to determine whether
15 the court should issue an order authorizing the involuntary
16 administration of psychiatric medication to the defendant for the
17 purpose of treatment to competency.
18 3. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 2, the
19 court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
20 held within 10 days after the filing of the motion.
21 4. After the hearing described in subsection 3, the court may
22 issue an order authorizing the involuntary administration of
23 psychiatric medication to the defendant if, after considering the
24 facts and circumstances of the case, the court finds that:
25 (a) The State has an important governmental interest in
26 bringing the defendant to trial;
27 (b) Administering the psychiatric medication to the defendant
28 is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand
29 trial;
30 (c) Any alternative, less intrusive treatment is unlikely to
31 achieve substantially the same result; and
-
*SB465*

– 3 –
1 (d) Administration of the psychiatric medication to the
2 defendant is medically appropriate.
3 5. An order issued pursuant to subsection 4 continues in full
4 force and effect through the final adjudication in the criminal
5 action against the defendant.
6 6. As used in this section, “defendant” means a defendant
7 committed to the custody of the Administrator or the
8 Administrator’s designee pursuant to NRS 178.425.
9 Sec. 2. NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 178.3981 As used in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive,
11 and section 1 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the
12 words and terms defined in NRS 178.3982 to 178.399, inclusive,
13 have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
14 Sec. 3. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and
16 dangerous to himself or herself or to society and that commitment is
17 required for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive
18 treatment to competency and to attain competence, the judge shall
19 order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together with a
20 copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
21 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the
22 Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a division
23 facility that is secure. [The] If the treating psychiatrist of the
24 defendant determines that psychiatric medication is necessary to
25 restore the defendant to competency and the defendant refuses to
26 take such medication voluntarily, the prosecuting attorney may
27 seek an order [may include] for the involuntary administration of
28 psychiatric medication [if appropriate for treatment] to
29 [competency.] the defendant pursuant to section 1 of this act.
30 2. [The] A defendant committed into the custody of the
31 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee must be held in such
32 custody until a court orders the defendant’s release or until the
33 defendant is returned for trial or judgment as provided in NRS
34 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
35 3. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
36 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
37 commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
38 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
39 the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
40 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
41 might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
42 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
43 The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
44 appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
45 designee.

1 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, proceedings
2 against the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or

4 misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable of standing trial
5 or opposing pronouncement of judgment as provided in
6 NRS 178.400.
7 5. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with
8 no substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable
9 future, and released from custody or from obligations as an
10 outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS

25 pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
26 than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.

28 the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a
29 form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a record of that

31 Records of Criminal History, along with a statement indicating that
32 the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
33 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check
34 System.

23 proceedings; and

32 during the court proceedings, [the Administrator or the
33 Administrator’s designee shall include in the written report] a
