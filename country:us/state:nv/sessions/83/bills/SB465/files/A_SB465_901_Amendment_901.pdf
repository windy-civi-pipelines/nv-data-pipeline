EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the procedure for evaluating
certain criminal defendants whom the court finds to be incompetent;
revising provisions relating to the involuntary administration of
psychiatric medication to certain criminal defendants; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a defendant must be competent to stand trial or receive a
2 pronouncement of judgment. (NRS 178.400) Under existing law, if the court finds a defendant
3 incompetent and certain other requirements are met: (1) the judge is required to commit the
4 defendant to the custody of the Administrator of the Division of Public and Behavioral
5 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or the Administrator’s designee
6 for detention and treatment at a secure facility of the Division; and (2) the defendant must be
7 held in such custody until the court orders the defendant’s release or until the defendant is
8 returned for trial or judgment. (NRS 178.425) Existing law requires the Administrator of the
9 Division or the Administrator’s designee to periodically evaluate each such defendant and
10 report certain information relating to the competence of the defendant to the court that ordered
11 the defendant committed. (NRS 178.450) Existing law prescribes the procedure governing
12 these evaluations. (NRS 178.455) In general, section 4 of this bill revises this procedure by
13 reducing the number of evaluators the Administrator or designee is required to appoint to
14 evaluate the competence of the defendant from three evaluators to two evaluators. However, if
15 those two evaluators disagree concerning the competence of the defendant, section 4 requires
16 the Administrator or designee to appoint a third evaluator to evaluate the defendant.
17 [Section 1 of this bill establishes a procedure for obtaining a court order to authorize the
18 involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to a defendant committed to the custody
19 of the Division. Section 1 also requires the court to make specific findings before issuing such
20 an order.] Under existing law, a court is authorized to include the involuntary administration
21 of medication in an order committing a defendant to the custody of the Division. (NRS
22 178.425) Section 3 of this bill removes this authorization and instead requires the prosecuting
23 attorney to seek a separate court order for the involuntary administration of psychiatric
24 medication . [using the procedure established in section 1. Section 2 of this bill makes certain
25 definitions in existing law relating to the competency of a defendant applicable to section 1.]

Senate Amendment No. 901 to Senate Bill No. 465 Page 4
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. [Chapter 178 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. If the treating psychiatrist of a defendant determines that psychiatric
4 medication is necessary to restore the defendant to competency and the defendant
5 refuses to take such medication voluntarily, the Administrator or the
6 Administrator’s designee shall:
7 (a) Submit a written report to this effect to the committing court; and
8 (b) Send a copy of the written report to the prosecuting attorney and the
9 counsel for the defendant.
10 2. Upon receiving a copy of the written report submitted pursuant to
11 subsection 1, the prosecuting attorney may file a motion with the court requesting
12 a hearing to determine whether the court should issue an order authorizing the
13 involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to the defendant for the
14 purpose of treatment to competency.
15 3. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 2, the court shall
16 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 10 days after
17 the filing of the motion.
18 4. After the hearing described in subsection 3, the court may issue an order
19 authorizing the involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to the
20 defendant if, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the court
21 finds that:
22 (a) The State has an important governmental interest in bringing the
23 defendant to trial;
24 (b) Administering the psychiatric medication to the defendant is substantially
25 likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial;
26 (c) Any alternative, less intrusive treatment is unlikely to achieve
27 substantially the same result; and
28 (d) Administration of the psychiatric medication to the defendant is
29 medically appropriate.
30 5. An order issued pursuant to subsection 4 continues in full force and
31 effect through the final adjudication in the criminal action against the defendant.
32 6. As used in this section, “defendant” means a defendant committed to the
33 custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee pursuant to NRS
34 178.425.] (Deleted by amendment.)
35 Sec. 2. [NRS 178.3981 is hereby amended to read as follows:
36 178.3981 As used in NRS 178.3981 to 178.4715, inclusive, and section 1 of
37 this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS
38 178.3982 to 178.399, inclusive, have the meanings ascribed to them in those
39 sections.] (Deleted by amendment.)
40 Sec. 3. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and dangerous to
42 himself or herself or to society and that commitment is required for a determination
43 of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain
44 competence, the judge shall order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith,
45 together with a copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
46 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the Administrator’s
47 designee for detention and treatment at a division facility that is secure. [The] If the

Senate Amendment No. 901 to Senate Bill No. 465 Page 5
1 treating psychiatrist of the defendant determines that psychiatric medication is
2 necessary to restore the defendant to competency and the defendant refuses to
3 take such medication voluntarily, the prosecuting attorney may seek an order
4 [may include] for the involuntary administration of psychiatric medication [if
5 appropriate for treatment] to [competency.] the defendant . [pursuant to section 1
6 of this act.]
7 2. [The] A defendant committed into the custody of the Administrator or the
8 Administrator’s designee must be held in such custody until a court orders the
9 defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for trial or judgment as
10 provided in NRS 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
11 3. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not dangerous to himself or
12 herself or to society, and finds that commitment is not required for a determination
13 of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain
14 competence, the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
15 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it might be beneficial,
16 and for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive treatment to
17 competency and to attain competence. The court may require the defendant to give
18 bail for any periodic appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
19 designee.
20 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, proceedings against the
21 defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or the Administrator’s
22 designee or, if the defendant is charged with a misdemeanor, the judge finds the
23 defendant capable of standing trial or opposing pronouncement of judgment as
24 provided in NRS 178.400.
25 5. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with no substantial
26 probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable future, and released from
27 custody or from obligations as an outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection
28 4 of NRS 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were suspended
29 must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the same circumstances may be
30 brought except upon application by the prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of
31 the district court, or his or her designee, and with leave of the court where:
32 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts, that the
33 defendant has attained competency;
34 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges again; and
35 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for commencing a
36 criminal action for the crime with which the defendant was charged, has not lapsed
37 since the date of the alleged offense.
38  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made pursuant to
39 this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less than 24 hours before the
40 hearing on the application.
41 6. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section, the court shall
42 cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a form prescribed by the
43 Department of Public Safety, a record of that finding to be transmitted to the
44 Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History, along with a statement
45 indicating that the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
46 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
47 7. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal Background Check
48 System” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 179A.062.
49 Sec. 4. NRS 178.455 is hereby amended to read as follows:
50 178.455 1. Except as otherwise provided for persons charged with or
51 convicted of a misdemeanor, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
52 shall appoint a licensed psychiatrist and a licensed psychologist [from the treatment

5 the nature of the offense charged and the nature and purpose of the court
6 proceedings or to aid and assist his or her counsel during the court proceedings,
7 the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall [also] appoint a third
8 evaluator [who] to evaluate the defendant. The third evaluator must be a licensed
9 psychiatrist or psychologist [, must be] who is certified pursuant to NRS 178.417 .
10 [and must not be a member of the treatment team . to evaluate the defendant.]

27 and assist his or her counsel during the court proceedings, [the Administrator or the
28 Administrator’s designee shall include in the written report] a statement of the
