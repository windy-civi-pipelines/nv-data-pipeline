Senate Bill No. 465–Committee on Finance
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the procedure for
evaluating certain criminal defendants whom the court finds
to be incompetent; revising provisions relating to the
involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to
certain criminal defendants; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that a defendant must be competent to stand trial or
receive a pronouncement of judgment. (NRS 178.400) Under existing law, if the
court finds a defendant incompetent and certain other requirements are met: (1) the
judge is required to commit the defendant to the custody of the Administrator of
the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and
Human Services or the Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a
secure facility of the Division; and (2) the defendant must be held in such custody
until the court orders the defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for
trial or judgment. (NRS 178.425) Existing law requires the Administrator of the
Division or the Administrator’s designee to periodically evaluate each such
defendant and report certain information relating to the competence of the
defendant to the court that ordered the defendant committed. (NRS 178.450)
Existing law prescribes the procedure governing these evaluations. (NRS 178.455)
In general, section 4 of this bill revises this procedure by reducing the number of
evaluators the Administrator or designee is required to appoint to evaluate the
competence of the defendant from three evaluators to two evaluators. However, if
those two evaluators disagree concerning the competence of the defendant, section
4 requires the Administrator or designee to appoint a third evaluator to evaluate the
defendant.
Under existing law, a court is authorized to include the involuntary
administration of medication in an order committing a defendant to the custody of
the Division. (NRS 178.425) Section 3 of this bill removes this authorization and
instead requires the prosecuting attorney to seek a separate court order for the
involuntary administration of psychiatric medication.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

Sec. 3. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and
dangerous to himself or herself or to society and that commitment is

certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the
Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a division
facility that is secure. [The] If the treating psychiatrist of the
defendant determines that psychiatric medication is necessary to
restore the defendant to competency and the defendant refuses to
take such medication voluntarily, the prosecuting attorney may
seek an order [may include] for the involuntary administration of
psychiatric medication [if appropriate for treatment] to
[competency.] the defendant.
2. [The] A defendant committed into the custody of the
Administrator or the Administrator’s designee must be held in such
custody until a court orders the defendant’s release or until the
defendant is returned for trial or judgment as provided in NRS
178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
3. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
designee.
4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, proceedings
against the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or
the Administrator’s designee or, if the defendant is charged with a
misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable of standing trial
or opposing pronouncement of judgment as provided in
NRS 178.400.
5. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with
no substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable
future, and released from custody or from obligations as an
outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS
178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were
suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the
same circumstances may be brought except upon application by the
prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of the district court, or his or
her designee, and with leave of the court where:
(a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts,
that the defendant has attained competency;

again; and
(c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for
commencing a criminal action for the crime with which the
defendant was charged, has not lapsed since the date of the alleged
offense.
 The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made
pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.
6. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section,
the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a
form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a record of that
finding to be transmitted to the Central Repository for Nevada
Records of Criminal History, along with a statement indicating that
the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check
System.
7. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal
Background Check System” has the meaning ascribed to it in
NRS 179A.062.
Sec. 4. NRS 178.455 is hereby amended to read as follows:
178.455 1. Except as otherwise provided for persons charged
with or convicted of a misdemeanor, the Administrator or the
Administrator’s designee shall appoint a licensed psychiatrist and a
licensed psychologist [from the treatment team] who is certified
pursuant to NRS 178.417 to separately evaluate the defendant.
[The] One such appointee must be a member of the treatment
team.
2. If the appointees who conduct the evaluations required by
subsection 1 disagree concerning whether the defendant has the
present ability to understand the nature of the offense charged and
the nature and purpose of the court proceedings or to aid and
assist his or her counsel during the court proceedings, the
Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall [also] appoint a
third evaluator [who] to evaluate the defendant. The third
evaluator must be a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist [, must be]
who is certified pursuant to NRS 178.417 . [and must not be a
member of the treatment team.]
3. Upon the completion of the [evaluation and treatment of the
defendant,] evaluations required by subsection 1 and, if applicable,
subsection 2, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
shall report to the court in writing [his or her] the specific findings
and opinion [upon] of each appointee.
