SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain criminal
defendants. (BDR 14-1119)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the procedure for
evaluating certain criminal defendants whom the court
finds to be incompetent; revising provisions relating to the
involuntary administration of psychiatric medication to
certain criminal defendants; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a defendant must be competent to stand trial or
2 receive a pronouncement of judgment. (NRS 178.400) Under existing law, if the
3 court finds a defendant incompetent and certain other requirements are met: (1) the
4 judge is required to commit the defendant to the custody of the Administrator of the
5 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
6 Services or the Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a secure
7 facility of the Division; and (2) the defendant must be held in such custody until the
8 court orders the defendant’s release or until the defendant is returned for trial or
9 judgment. (NRS 178.425) Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division
10 or the Administrator’s designee to periodically evaluate each such defendant and
11 report certain information relating to the competence of the defendant to the court
12 that ordered the defendant committed. (NRS 178.450) Existing law prescribes the
13 procedure governing these evaluations. (NRS 178.455) In general, section 4 of this
14 bill revises this procedure by reducing the number of evaluators the Administrator
15 or designee is required to appoint to evaluate the competence of the defendant from
16 three evaluators to two evaluators. However, if those two evaluators disagree
17 concerning the competence of the defendant, section 4 requires the Administrator
18 or designee to appoint a third evaluator to evaluate the defendant.

19 Under existing law, a court is authorized to include the involuntary
20 administration of medication in an order committing a defendant to the custody of
21 the Division. (NRS 178.425) Section 3 of this bill removes this authorization and
22 instead requires the prosecuting attorney to seek a separate court order for the
23 involuntary administration of psychiatric medication.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. (Deleted by amendment.)
2 Sec. 2. (Deleted by amendment.)
3 Sec. 3. NRS 178.425 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 178.425 1. If the court finds the defendant incompetent, and
5 dangerous to himself or herself or to society and that commitment is
6 required for a determination of the defendant’s ability to receive
7 treatment to competency and to attain competence, the judge shall
8 order the sheriff to convey the defendant forthwith, together with a
9 copy of the complaint, the commitment and the physicians’
10 certificate, if any, into the custody of the Administrator or the
11 Administrator’s designee for detention and treatment at a division
12 facility that is secure. [The] If the treating psychiatrist of the
13 defendant determines that psychiatric medication is necessary to
14 restore the defendant to competency and the defendant refuses to
15 take such medication voluntarily, the prosecuting attorney may
16 seek an order [may include] for the involuntary administration of
17 psychiatric medication [if appropriate for treatment] to
18 [competency.] the defendant.
19 2. [The] A defendant committed into the custody of the
20 Administrator or the Administrator’s designee must be held in such
21 custody until a court orders the defendant’s release or until the
22 defendant is returned for trial or judgment as provided in NRS
23 178.450, 178.455 and 178.460.
24 3. If the court finds the defendant incompetent but not
25 dangerous to himself or herself or to society, and finds that
26 commitment is not required for a determination of the defendant’s
27 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence,
28 the judge shall order the defendant to report to the Administrator or
29 the Administrator’s designee as an outpatient for treatment, if it
30 might be beneficial, and for a determination of the defendant’s
31 ability to receive treatment to competency and to attain competence.
32 The court may require the defendant to give bail for any periodic
33 appearances before the Administrator or the Administrator’s
34 designee.
35 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, proceedings
36 against the defendant must be suspended until the Administrator or

2 misdemeanor, the judge finds the defendant capable of standing trial
3 or opposing pronouncement of judgment as provided in
4 NRS 178.400.
5 5. Whenever the defendant has been found incompetent, with
6 no substantial probability of attaining competency in the foreseeable
7 future, and released from custody or from obligations as an
8 outpatient pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 4 of NRS
9 178.460, the proceedings against the defendant which were
10 suspended must be dismissed. No new charge arising out of the
11 same circumstances may be brought except upon application by the
12 prosecuting attorney to the chief judge of the district court, or his or
13 her designee, and with leave of the court where:
14 (a) The State has a good faith belief, based on articulable facts,
15 that the defendant has attained competency;
16 (b) The State has a compelling interest in bringing charges
17 again; and
18 (c) The period, equal to the maximum time allowed by law for
19 commencing a criminal action for the crime with which the
20 defendant was charged, has not lapsed since the date of the alleged
21 offense.
22  The prosecuting attorney must give notice of an application made
23 pursuant to this subsection to the attorney for the defendant not less
24 than 24 hours before the hearing on the application.
25 6. If a defendant is found incompetent pursuant to this section,
26 the court shall cause, within 5 business days after the finding, on a
27 form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety, a record of that
28 finding to be transmitted to the Central Repository for Nevada
29 Records of Criminal History, along with a statement indicating that
30 the record is being transmitted for inclusion in each appropriate
31 database of the National Instant Criminal Background Check
32 System.
33 7. As used in this section, “National Instant Criminal
34 Background Check System” has the meaning ascribed to it in
35 NRS 179A.062.
36 Sec. 4. NRS 178.455 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 178.455 1. Except as otherwise provided for persons charged
38 with or convicted of a misdemeanor, the Administrator or the
39 Administrator’s designee shall appoint a licensed psychiatrist and a
40 licensed psychologist [from the treatment team] who is certified

1 present ability to understand the nature of the offense charged and
2 the nature and purpose of the court proceedings or to aid and
3 assist his or her counsel during the court proceedings, the

5 third evaluator [who] to evaluate the defendant. The third
6 evaluator must be a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist [, must be]
7 who is certified pursuant to NRS 178.417 . [and must not be a
8 member of the treatment team.]
9 3. Upon the completion of the [evaluation and treatment of the
10 defendant,] evaluations required by subsection 1 and, if applicable,
11 subsection 2, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee
12 shall report to the court in writing [his or her] the specific findings
13 and opinion [upon] of each appointee.
14 4. The specific findings and opinion of an appointee must
15 include, without limitation:
16 (a) The opinion of the appointee as to whether the [person]
17 defendant has the present ability to:
18 [(a)] (1) Understand the nature of the offense charged;
19 [(b)] (2) Understand the nature and purpose of the court
20 proceedings; and
21 [(c)] (3) Aid and assist [the person’s] his or her counsel in the

29 during the court proceedings, [the Administrator or the
30 Administrator’s designee shall include in the written report] a

33 treatment to competency and will attain competency in the
34 foreseeable future.

36 (a) Maintained by the Administrator or the Administrator’s
