AN ACT relating to the Public Employees’ Retirement System;
exempting, in certain circumstances, retired members of
the System who accept employment or an independent
contract with certain public employers from certain
provisions governing the employment of such retired
members; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a system of retirement, known as the Public
2 Employees’ Retirement System, to provide benefits for the retirement, disability or
3 death of employees of certain public employers. (NRS 286.110) Generally, a
4 consequence of a retired member of the System accepting employment or an
5 independent contract with a public employer under the System is that the member is
6 disqualified from receiving the member’s retirement allowances under the System
7 for the duration of the employment or contract. (NRS 286.520, 286.523) Existing
8 law provides exemptions from this consequence for retired members who accept
9 employment or enter into a contract with certain public employers or who fill
10 positions for which there is a critical labor shortage. (NRS 286.520, 286.523,
11 286.525) This bill adds an additional exemption from this consequence for a retired
12 member who accepts employment or an independent contract to fill a full-time
13 position eligible for membership with a public employer under the System that is a
14 city whose population is less than 25,000 (currently all cities other than Carson
15 City, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) or a county
16 whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and
17 Washoe Counties) if: (1) the retired member previously had not been employed by
18 or entered into an independent contract with the public employer; (2) at the time

19 that the retired member accepts the employment or contract, the public employer
20 does not employ or have an independent contract with more than four retired
21 members who hold the exemption authorized under this bill; and (3) the retired
22 member does not reenroll in the System. This bill requires the public employer of
23 such an exempt retired member to pay contributions to the System in relation to the
24 exemption at the total contribution rate that the public employer would pay for a
25 public employee participating in the System who is employed in a similar position
26 and elected to have the employee’s portion of the contribution paid by the public
27 employer.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 286.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 286.520 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and
3 NRS 286.525, the consequences of the employment of a retired
4 employee are:
5 (a) A retired employee who accepts employment or an
6 independent contract with a public employer under this System is
7 disqualified from receiving any allowances under this System for
8 the duration of that employment or contract if:
9 (1) The retired employee accepted the employment or
10 contract within 90 calendar days after the effective date of the
11 employee’s retirement; or
12 (2) The retired employee is employed in a position which is
13 eligible to participate in this System.
14 (b) If a retired employee accepts employment or an independent
15 contract with a public employer under this System more than 90
16 calendar days after the effective date of the employee’s retirement in
17 a position which is not eligible to participate in this System, the
18 employee’s allowance under this System terminates upon the
19 employee’s earning an amount equal to one-half of the average
20 salary for participating public employees who are not police officers
21 or firefighters in any fiscal year, for the duration of that employment
22 or contract.
23 (c) If a retired employee accepts employment with an employer
24 who is not a public employer under this System, the employee is
25 entitled to the same allowances as a retired employee who has no
26 employment.

28 the System:
29 (a) Within 10 days after the first day of an employment or

1 (c) Within 10 days after a retired employee earns more than one-
2 half of the average salary for participating public employees who
3 are not police officers or firefighters in any fiscal year from an
4 employment or contract governed by paragraph (b) of subsection 1.
5 3. For the purposes of this section, the average salary for
6 participating public employees who are not police officers or
7 firefighters must be computed on the basis of the most recent
8 actuarial valuation of the System.
9 4. If a retired employee who accepts employment or an
10 independent contract with a public employer under this System
11 pursuant to this section elects not to reenroll in the System pursuant
12 to subsection 1 of NRS 286.525, the public employer with which the
13 retired employee accepted employment or an independent contract
14 may pay contributions on behalf of the retired employee to a
15 retirement fund which is not a part of the System in an amount not
16 to exceed the amount of the contributions that the public employer
17 would pay to the System on behalf of a participating public
18 employee who is employed in a similar position.
19 5. If a retired employee is chosen by election or appointment to
20 fill an elective public office, the retired employee is entitled to the
21 same allowances as a retired employee who has no employment,
22 unless the retired employee is serving in the same office in which
23 the retired employee served and for which the retired employee
24 received service credit as a member. A public employer may pay
25 contributions on behalf of such a retired employee to a retirement
26 fund which is not a part of the System in an amount not to exceed
27 the amount of the contributions that the public employer would pay
28 to the System on behalf of a participating public employee who
29 serves in the same office.
30 6. The System may waive for one period of 30 days or less a
31 retired employee’s disqualification under this section if the public
32 employer certifies in writing, in advance, that the retired employee
33 is recalled to meet an emergency and that no other qualified person
34 is immediately available.
35 7. A person who accepts employment or an independent
36 contract with:
