EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; ratifying and entering into the
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate
Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain information
with data systems created by the Compact; providing
audiologists and speech-language pathologists practicing
in this State under the Compact with the same legal status
as persons who are licensed to practice audiology and
speech-language pathology in this State; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of audiologists and
2 speech-language pathologists in this State by the Speech-Language Pathology,
3 Audiology and Hearing Aid Dispensing Board. (Chapter 637B of NRS) Section 1
4 of this bill enacts the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate
5 Compact, which allows a person who is licensed as an audiologist or speech-
6 language pathologist in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as an
7 audiologist or speech-language pathologist in other states that are members of the
8 Compact. In order to practice as an audiologist or speech-language pathologist
9 under the Compact, the Compact requires an audiologist or speech-language
10 pathologist to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2) have no encumbrances
11 on his or her license; (3) meet certain other requirements for eligibility; (4) have
12 had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority to practice under the
13 Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) notify the Audiology and Speech-
14 Language Pathology Compact Commission, a joint public body established by the
15 Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
16 (6) pay any applicable fees; and (7) report any adverse action taken against him or
17 her within 30 days after the date the adverse action is taken. The Compact
18 additionally requires a member state to recognize the right of an audiologist or
19 speech-language pathologist who is licensed by any member state to practice
-
*AB230*

– 2 –
20 audiology or speech-language pathology, as applicable, through telehealth in any
21 member state under conditions prescribed by the Commission. The Compact also:
22 (1) authorizes a member state to take adverse action against an audiologist or
23 speech-language pathologist who is practicing in the member state under the
24 Compact; (2) authorizes the Commission to levy and collect assessments from
25 member states to cover the cost of its operations; and (3) creates a data system to
26 facilitate the sharing of certain information among member states.
27 With certain exceptions, existing law makes a complaint filed with the Board
28 and certain other documents and information related to such a complaint
29 confidential. (NRS 637B.288) Section 2 of this bill creates an exception to this
30 provision to, in general, authorize the Board to disclose such information to the data
31 system created by section 1 when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill
32 provides for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data
33 system.
34 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as an audiologist or speech-language
35 pathologist in this State under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a
36 license issued by the Board, thereby providing such persons with the same
37 authority, duties and legal protections as a licensee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 637B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:

12
13 The purpose of this Compact is to facilitate interstate practice
14 of audiology and speech-language pathology with the goal of
15 improving public access to audiology and speech-language
16 pathology services. The practice of audiology and speech-
17 language pathology occurs in the state where the
18 patient/client/student is located at the time of the
19 patient/client/student encounter. The Compact preserves
20 the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and
21 safety through the current system of state licensure.
22 This Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:
23 1. Increase public access to audiology and speech-language
24 pathology services by providing for the mutual recognition of
25 other member state licenses;
-

6 personnel;
7 5. Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative and
8 disciplinary information between member states;
9 6. Allow a remote state to hold a provider of services with a
10 compact privilege in that state accountable to that state’s practice
11 standards; and
12 7. Allow for the use of telehealth technology to facilitate
13 increased access to audiology and speech-language pathology

15 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes
16 of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
17 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
18 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
19 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
20 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
21 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
22 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
23 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
24 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
25 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
26 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
27 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
28 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
29 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
30 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
31 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
32 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
33 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
34 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
35 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
36 electronically, the confidential information from the information
37 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
38 confidential.
39 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
40 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
41 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
42 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
43 means of an electronic medium if:
44 (a) The public record:
45 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
-

– 26 –
1 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
2 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
3 means of an electronic medium would:
4 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
5 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
6 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
7 information that is not otherwise confidential.
8 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
9 has legal custody or control of a public record:
10 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
11 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
12 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
13 medium.
14 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
15 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
16 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
17 or herself.
