Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; ratifying and entering into the
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate
Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain information with
data systems created by the Compact; providing audiologists
and speech-language pathologists practicing in this State
under the Compact with the same legal status as persons who
are licensed to practice audiology and speech-language
pathology in this State; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of audiologists and
speech-language pathologists in this State by the Speech-Language Pathology,
Audiology and Hearing Aid Dispensing Board. (Chapter 637B of NRS) Section 1
of this bill enacts the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate
Compact, which allows a person who is licensed as an audiologist or speech-
language pathologist in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as an
audiologist or speech-language pathologist in other states that are members of the
Compact. In order to practice as an audiologist or speech-language pathologist
under the Compact, the Compact requires an audiologist or speech-language
pathologist to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2) have no encumbrances
on his or her license; (3) meet certain other requirements for eligibility; (4) have
had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority to practice under the
Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) notify the Audiology and Speech-
Language Pathology Compact Commission, a joint public body established by the
Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
(6) pay any applicable fees; and (7) report any adverse action taken against him or
her within 30 days after the date the adverse action is taken. The Compact
additionally requires a member state to recognize the right of an audiologist or
speech-language pathologist who is licensed by any member state to practice
audiology or speech-language pathology, as applicable, through telehealth in any
member state under conditions prescribed by the Commission. The Compact also:
(1) authorizes a member state to take adverse action against an audiologist or
speech-language pathologist who is practicing in the member state under the
Compact; (2) authorizes the Commission to levy and collect assessments from
member states to cover the cost of its operations; and (3) creates a data system to
facilitate the sharing of certain information among member states.
With certain exceptions, existing law makes a complaint filed with the Board
and certain other documents and information related to such a complaint
confidential. (NRS 637B.288) Section 2 of this bill creates an exception to this
provision to, in general, authorize the Board to disclose such information to the data
system created by section 1 when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill
provides for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data
system.

Section 2:
Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as an audiologist or speech-language
pathologist in this State under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a
license issued by the Board, thereby providing such persons with the same
authority, duties and legal protections as a licensee.

entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.

Section 182:
2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.

Section 183:
3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.

Section 184:
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium if:
(a) The public record:
(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:
(1) Give access to proprietary software; or
(2) Require the production of information that is confidential
and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
information that is not otherwise confidential.

Section 185:
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of audiologists and
speech-language pathologists in this State by the Speech-Language Pathology,
Audiology and Hearing Aid Dispensing Board. (Chapter 637B of NRS) Section 1
of this bill enacts the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate
Compact, which allows a person who is licensed as an audiologist or speech-
language pathologist in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as an
audiologist or speech-language pathologist in other states that are members of the
Compact. In order to practice as an audiologist or speech-language pathologist
under the Compact, the Compact requires an audiologist or speech-language
pathologist to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2) have no encumbrances
on his or her license; (3) meet certain other requirements for eligibility; (4) have
had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority to practice under the
Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) notify the Audiology and Speech-
Language Pathology Compact Commission, a joint public body established by the
Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
(6) pay any applicable fees; and (7) report any adverse action taken against him or
her within 30 days after the date the adverse action is taken. The Compact
additionally requires a member state to recognize the right of an audiologist or
speech-language pathologist who is licensed by any member state to practice
audiology or speech-language pathology, as applicable, through telehealth in any
member state under conditions prescribed by the Commission. The Compact also:
(1) authorizes a member state to take adverse action against an audiologist or
speech-language pathologist who is practicing in the member state under the
Compact; (2) authorizes the Commission to levy and collect assessments from
member states to cover the cost of its operations; and (3) creates a data system to
facilitate the sharing of certain information among member states.
With certain exceptions, existing law makes a complaint filed with the Board
and certain other documents and information related to such a complaint
confidential. (NRS 637B.288) Section 2 of this bill creates an exception to this
provision to, in general, authorize the Board to disclose such information to the data
system created by section 1 when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill
provides for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data
system.
Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as an audiologist or speech-language
pathologist in this State under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing under a
license issued by the Board, thereby providing such persons with the same
authority, duties and legal protections as a licensee.

the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and
safety through the current system of state licensure.
This Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:
1. Increase public access to audiology and speech-language
pathology services by providing for the mutual recognition of
other member state licenses;
2. Enhance the states’ ability to protect the public’s health
and safety;
3. Encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating
multistate audiology and speech-language pathology practice;
4. Support spouses of relocating active duty military
personnel;
5. Enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative and
disciplinary information between member states;
6. Allow a remote state to hold a provider of services with a
compact privilege in that state accountable to that state’s practice
standards; and

the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this

entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium if:
(a) The public record:
(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:
(1) Give access to proprietary software; or
(2) Require the production of information that is confidential
and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
