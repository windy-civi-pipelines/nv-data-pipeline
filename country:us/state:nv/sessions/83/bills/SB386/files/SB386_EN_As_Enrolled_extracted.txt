Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to
practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of
NRS)

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the
credentials of an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the
issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
integration, to grant such a license to a person who: (1) has legally practiced
massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in another state, territory or
possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not less than 3 years;
(2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes certain
examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that
the provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the
issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology
and a license to practice structural integration.

Section 3:
Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include
the application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.

Section 4:
Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the
location of its meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
requirements for the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and
structural integration establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires
the Board to adopt regulations which include the grounds for the imposition of
disciplinary action against the holder of a certificate of a massage, reflexology and
structural integration establishment and the disciplinary actions which the Board
may impose.
Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a
temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration.
(NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those
requirements to instead authorize the Board to issue a temporary license to practice

massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in this State to a person: (1)
who holds an active license in good standing to practice massage therapy,
reflexology or structural integration issued by another state, territory or possession
of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies the
requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.

Section 5:
Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a
written examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage
therapy, reflexology or structural integration to be issued a temporary license.
Existing law provides that a temporary license expires 90 days after issuance and is
not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a
person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for a new temporary
license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license most
recently issued to the person.
Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to
compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS
640C.750) Section 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of
the Board to issue such subpoenas.
Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage
therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed
person from using any false or misleading statement or representation in advertising
that is intended to induce another person to use the services of the massage
therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner. Existing law also
requires certain advertising by a licensed massage therapist, reflexologist or
structural integration practitioner to include certain information. (NRS 640C.930)

Section 6:
Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements applicable to
massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 386–Senators Scheible;
Daly, Krasner and Taylor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to massage therapy; authorizing the Board of
Massage Therapy to issue a license to practice massage
therapy, reflexology or structural integration to a person who
would not otherwise qualify for such a license if the person
satisfies certain other requirements; revising the acts which
constitute the practice of reflexology; eliminating certain
requirements for meetings of the Board; requiring the Board
to adopt regulations concerning disciplinary actions against
the holder of a certificate of a massage, reflexology and
structural integration establishment; revising provisions
governing the issuance of temporary licenses by the Board;
authorizing the Executive Director of the Board to issue
subpoenas; revising provisions governing certain
advertisements; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to
practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of
NRS)
Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the
credentials of an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the
issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
integration, to grant such a license to a person who: (1) has legally practiced
massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in another state, territory or
possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not less than 3 years;
(2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes certain
examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that
the provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the
issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology
and a license to practice structural integration.
Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include
the application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.
Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the
location of its meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
requirements for the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and
structural integration establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires
the Board to adopt regulations which include the grounds for the imposition of
disciplinary action against the holder of a certificate of a massage, reflexology and
structural integration establishment and the disciplinary actions which the Board
may impose.
Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a
temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration.
(NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those
requirements to instead authorize the Board to issue a temporary license to practice
-

– 2 –
massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in this State to a person: (1)
who holds an active license in good standing to practice massage therapy,
reflexology or structural integration issued by another state, territory or possession
of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies the
requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.
Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a
written examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage
therapy, reflexology or structural integration to be issued a temporary license.
Existing law provides that a temporary license expires 90 days after issuance and is
not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a
person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for a new temporary
license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license most
recently issued to the person.
Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to
compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS
640C.750) Section 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of
the Board to issue such subpoenas.
Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage
therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed
person from using any false or misleading statement or representation in advertising
that is intended to induce another person to use the services of the massage
therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner. Existing law also
requires certain advertising by a licensed massage therapist, reflexologist or
structural integration practitioner to include certain information. (NRS 640C.930)
Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements applicable to
massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.
