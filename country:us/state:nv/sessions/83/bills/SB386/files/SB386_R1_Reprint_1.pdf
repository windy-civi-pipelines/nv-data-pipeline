Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to
2 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of
3 NRS)
4 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the
5 credentials of an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the
6 issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
7 integration, to grant such a license to a person who: (1) has legally practiced
-

– 2 –
8 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in another state, territory or
9 possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not less than 3 years;
10 (2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes certain
11 examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that
12 the provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the
13 issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology
14 and a license to practice structural integration.
15 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include
16 the application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.
17 Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the
18 location of its meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.
19 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
20 requirements for the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and
21 structural integration establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires
22 the Board to adopt regulations which include the grounds for the imposition of
23 disciplinary action against the holder of a certificate of a massage, reflexology and
24 structural integration establishment and the disciplinary actions which the Board
25 may impose.
26 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a
27 temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration.
28 (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those
29 requirements to instead authorize the Board to issue a temporary license to practice
30 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in this State to a person: (1)
31 who holds an active license in good standing to practice massage therapy,
32 reflexology or structural integration issued by another state, territory or possession
33 of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies the
34 requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.
35 Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a
36 written examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage
37 therapy, reflexology or structural integration to be issued a temporary license.
38 Existing law provides that a temporary license expires 90 days after issuance and is
39 not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a
40 person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for a new temporary
41 license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license most
42 recently issued to the person.
43 Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to
44 compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS
45 640C.750) Section 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of
46 the Board to issue such subpoenas.
47 Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage
48 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed
49 person from using any false or misleading statement or representation in advertising
50 that is intended to induce another person to use the services of the massage
51 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner. Existing law also
52 requires certain advertising by a licensed massage therapist, reflexologist or
53 structural integration practitioner to include certain information. (NRS 640C.930)
54 Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements applicable to
55 massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.

12 mileage allowed by law for a witness in a civil case. The amount
13 must be paid by the party who requested the subpoena. If any
14 witness who has not been required to attend at the request of any
15 party is subpoenaed by the Board, his or her fees and mileage must
16 be paid by the Board from money available for that purpose.
17 4. If any person fails to comply with the subpoena within 10
18 days after it is issued, the Chair of the Board may petition a court of
19 competent jurisdiction for an order of the court compelling
20 compliance with the subpoena.
21 5. Upon the filing of such a petition, the court shall enter an
22 order directing the person subpoenaed to appear before the court at a
23 time and place to be fixed by the court in its order, the time to be not
24 more than 10 days after the date of the order, and to show cause why
25 the person has not complied with the subpoena. A certified copy of
26 the order must be served upon the person subpoenaed.
27 6. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly
28 issued by the Board, the court shall enter an order compelling
29 compliance with the subpoena. The failure of the person to comply
30 with the order is a contempt of the court that issued the order.
31 Sec. 10. NRS 640C.930 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 640C.930 1. A person shall not advertise as a massage
33 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner in this
34 State unless the person is licensed to practice massage therapy,
35 reflexology or structural integration pursuant to this chapter.
36 2. A person licensed to practice massage therapy, reflexology
37 or structural integration pursuant to this chapter shall not
38 disseminate, as part of any advertising by the massage therapist,

4 4. A person shall not advertise a massage, reflexology and

8 to NRS 640C.330.
9 5. A person who holds a certificate to operate a massage,
10 reflexology and structural integration establishment shall not
11 disseminate, as part of any advertising by the person holding the
12 certificate, any false or misleading statement or representation of
13 material fact that is intended, directly or indirectly, to induce
14 another person to use the services of the massage, reflexology and
15 structural integration establishment.
16 6. All advertising by a person who holds a certificate to
17 operate a massage, reflexology and structural integration
18 establishment must include his or her name and the name of the
19 massage, reflexology and structural integration establishment. All
20 advertising in a telephone directory or a newspaper must also
21 include the number of the certificate to operate the massage,
22 reflexology and structural integration establishment.
23 7. A person who violates any provision of subsection 1 , [or] 2
24 , 4 or 5 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
25 [5.] 8. If, after notice and a hearing as required by law, the
26 Board determines that a person has willfully engaged in advertising
27 in a manner that violates the provisions of this section or NRS
28 640C.910, the Board may, in addition to any penalty, punishment or
29 disciplinary action authorized by the provisions of this chapter,
30 order the person to cease and desist the unlawful advertising. The
31 provisions of this subsection do not apply to any person whose
32 license has been expired for less than 90 days or is temporarily
33 suspended.
34 [6.] 9. The Board may order any person convicted of a crime
35 involving violence, prostitution or any other sexual offense to cause
36 any telephone number included in the advertising to be disconnected
37 from service. If the Board orders the person to cause any telephone
38 number to be disconnected from service and the person fails to
39 comply within 5 days after the date on which the person is served
40 with the order, the Board may:
41 (a) If the provider is regulated by the Public Utilities
42 Commission of Nevada, request the Commission to order the
43 provider to disconnect the telephone number from service pursuant
44 to NRS 703.175 and 707.355; or

– 14 –
1 (b) If the provider is not regulated by the Public Utilities

6 disconnect the telephone number from service.
7 [7.] 10. A provider shall not:
8 (a) Forward or offer to forward the telephone calls of a
9 telephone number disconnected from service pursuant to this
10 section; or
11 (b) Provide or offer to provide a message that includes a new
12 telephone number for the person whose telephone number was
13 disconnected from service pursuant to this section.
14 [8.] 11. If a provider complies in good faith with a request to
15 disconnect a telephone number from service pursuant to this section,
16 such good-faith compliance shall constitute a complete defense to
17 any civil or criminal action brought against the provider arising
18 from the disconnection or termination of service.
19 [9.] 12. As used in this section:
20 (a) “Advertising” means the intentional placement or issuance of
