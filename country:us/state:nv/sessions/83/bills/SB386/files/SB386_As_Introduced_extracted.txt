Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to
2 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of
3 NRS)
4 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the
5 credentials of an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the
6 issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
7 integration, to grant such a license to a person who: (1) has legally practiced
-

– 2 –
8 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in another state, territory or
9 possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not less than 3 years;
10 (2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes certain
11 examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that
12 the provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the
13 issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology
14 and a license to practice structural integration.
15 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include
16 the application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.
17 Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the
18 location of its meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.
19 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
20 requirements for the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and
21 structural integration establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires
22 the Board to adopt regulations which include the grounds for the imposition of
23 disciplinary action against the holder of a certificate of a massage, reflexology and
24 structural integration establishment and the disciplinary actions which the Board
25 may impose.
26 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a
27 temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration.
28 (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those
29 requirements to instead authorize the Board to issue a temporary license to practice
30 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in this State to a person: (1)
31 who holds an active license in good standing to practice massage therapy,
32 reflexology or structural integration issued by another state, territory or possession
33 of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies the
34 requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.
35 Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a
36 written examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage
37 therapy, reflexology or structural integration to be issued a temporary license.
38 Existing law provides that a temporary license expires 90 days after issuance and is
39 not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a
40 person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for a new temporary
41 license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license most
42 recently issued to the person.
43 Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to
44 compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS
45 640C.750) Section 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of
46 the Board to issue such subpoenas.
47 Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage
48 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed
49 person from using any false or misleading statement or representation in advertising
50 that is intended to induce another person to use the services of the massage
51 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner. Existing law also
52 requires certain advertising by a licensed massage therapist, reflexologist or
53 structural integration practitioner to include certain information. (NRS 640C.930)
54 Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements applicable to
55 massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.

12 examine witnesses; and
13 (b) The Board , the Executive Director of the Board or any
14 member [thereof] of the Board may issue subpoenas to compel the
15 attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers.
16 3. Each witness who is subpoenaed to appear before the Board
17 is entitled to receive for his or her attendance the same fees and
18 mileage allowed by law for a witness in a civil case. The amount
19 must be paid by the party who requested the subpoena. If any
20 witness who has not been required to attend at the request of any
21 party is subpoenaed by the Board, his or her fees and mileage must
22 be paid by the Board from money available for that purpose.
23 4. If any person fails to comply with the subpoena within 10
24 days after it is issued, the Chair of the Board may petition a court of
25 competent jurisdiction for an order of the court compelling
26 compliance with the subpoena.
27 5. Upon the filing of such a petition, the court shall enter an
28 order directing the person subpoenaed to appear before the court at a
29 time and place to be fixed by the court in its order, the time to be not
30 more than 10 days after the date of the order, and to show cause why
31 the person has not complied with the subpoena. A certified copy of
32 the order must be served upon the person subpoenaed.
33 6. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly
34 issued by the Board, the court shall enter an order compelling
35 compliance with the subpoena. The failure of the person to comply
36 with the order is a contempt of the court that issued the order.
37 Sec. 10. NRS 640C.930 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 640C.930 1. A person shall not advertise as a massage
39 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner in this
40 State unless the person is licensed to practice massage therapy,
41 reflexology or structural integration pursuant to this chapter.
42 2. A person licensed to practice massage therapy, reflexology

10 4. A person shall not advertise a massage, reflexology and

15 5. A person who holds a certificate to operate a massage,
16 reflexology and structural integration establishment shall not

21 structural integration establishment.
22 6. All advertising by a person who holds a certificate to
23 operate a massage, reflexology and structural integration
24 establishment must include his or her name and the name of the
25 massage, reflexology and structural integration establishment. All
26 advertising in a telephone directory or a newspaper must also
27 include the number of the certificate to operate the massage,
28 reflexology and structural integration establishment.
29 7. A person who violates any provision of subsection 1 , [or] 2
30 , 4 or 5 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
31 [5.] 8. If, after notice and a hearing as required by law, the
32 Board determines that a person has willfully engaged in advertising
33 in a manner that violates the provisions of this section or NRS
34 640C.910, the Board may, in addition to any penalty, punishment or
35 disciplinary action authorized by the provisions of this chapter,
36 order the person to cease and desist the unlawful advertising. The
37 provisions of this subsection do not apply to any person whose
38 license has been expired for less than 90 days or is temporarily
39 suspended.
40 [6.] 9. The Board may order any person convicted of a crime
41 involving violence, prostitution or any other sexual offense to cause
42 any telephone number included in the advertising to be disconnected
43 from service. If the Board orders the person to cause any telephone
44 number to be disconnected from service and the person fails to
-

– 14 –
1 comply within 5 days after the date on which the person is served
2 with the order, the Board may:
3 (a) If the provider is regulated by the Public Utilities

19 disconnected from service pursuant to this section.
20 [8.] 11. If a provider complies in good faith with a request to

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to massage therapy; authorizing the Board of
Massage Therapy to issue a license to practice massage
therapy, reflexology or structural integration to a person
who would not otherwise qualify for such a license if the
person satisfies certain other requirements; revising the
acts which constitute the practice of reflexology;
eliminating certain requirements for meetings of the
Board; requiring the Board to adopt regulations

authorizing the Executive Director of the Board to issue

advertisements; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to
2 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of
3 NRS)
4 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the
5 credentials of an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the
6 issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
7 integration, to grant such a license to a person who: (1) has legally practiced
-
*SB386*

– 2 –
8 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in another state, territory or
9 possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not less than 3 years;
10 (2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes certain
11 examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that
12 the provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the
13 issuance of a license to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology
14 and a license to practice structural integration.
15 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include
16 the application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.
17 Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the
18 location of its meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.
19 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
20 requirements for the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and
21 structural integration establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires
22 the Board to adopt regulations which include the grounds for the imposition of
23 disciplinary action against the holder of a certificate of a massage, reflexology and
24 structural integration establishment and the disciplinary actions which the Board
25 may impose.
26 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a
27 temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration.
28 (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those
29 requirements to instead authorize the Board to issue a temporary license to practice
30 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in this State to a person: (1)
31 who holds an active license in good standing to practice massage therapy,
32 reflexology or structural integration issued by another state, territory or possession
33 of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies the
34 requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.
35 Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a
36 written examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage
37 therapy, reflexology or structural integration to be issued a temporary license.
38 Existing law provides that a temporary license expires 90 days after issuance and is
39 not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610, 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a
40 person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for a new temporary
41 license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license most
42 recently issued to the person.
43 Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to
44 compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS
45 640C.750) Section 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of
46 the Board to issue such subpoenas.
47 Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage
48 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed
49 person from using any false or misleading statement or representation in advertising
50 that is intended to induce another person to use the services of the massage
51 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner. Existing law also
52 requires certain advertising by a licensed massage therapist, reflexologist or
53 structural integration practitioner to include certain information. (NRS 640C.930)
54 Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements applicable to
55 massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.
