AN ACT relating to massage therapy; authorizing the Board of Massage Therapy to
issue a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
integration to a person who would not otherwise qualify for such a
license if the person satisfies certain other requirements; revising the
acts which constitute the practice of reflexology; eliminating certain
requirements for meetings of the Board; requiring the Board to adopt
regulations concerning disciplinary actions against the holder of a
certificate of a massage, reflexology and structural integration
establishment; revising provisions governing the issuance of temporary
licenses by the Board; authorizing the Executive Director of the Board
to issue subpoenas; revising provisions governing certain
advertisements; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to practice
2 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of NRS)
3 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the credentials of
4 an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to
5 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration, to grant such a license to a
6 person who: (1) has legally practiced massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in
7 another state, territory or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not
8 less than 3 years; (2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes
9 certain examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that the
10 provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the issuance of a license
11 to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology and a license to practice
12 structural integration.
13 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include the
14 application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.
15 Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the location of its
16 meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.
Senate Amendment No. 323 to Senate Bill No. 386 Page 4
17 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the requirements for
18 the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and structural integration
19 establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires the Board to adopt regulations
20 which include the grounds for the imposition of disciplinary action against the holder of a
21 certificate of a massage, reflexology and structural integration establishment and the
22 disciplinary actions which the Board may impose.
23 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a temporary license
24 to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610,
25 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those requirements to instead authorize the
26 Board to issue a temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
27 integration in this State to a person: (1) who holds an active license in good standing to
28 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration issued by another state,
29 territory or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies
30 the requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.
31 Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a written
32 examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage therapy, reflexology or
33 structural integration to be issued a temporary license. Existing law provides that a temporary
34 license expires 90 days after issuance and is not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610,
35 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for
36 a new temporary license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license
37 most recently issued to the person.
38 Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to compel
39 the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS 640C.750) Section
40 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of the Board to issue such
41 subpoenas.
42 Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage therapist,
43 reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed person from using any
44 false or misleading statement or representation in advertising that is intended to induce
45 another person to use the services of the massage therapist, reflexologist or structural
46 integration practitioner. Existing law also requires certain advertising by a licensed massage
47 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner to include certain information.
48 (NRS 640C.930) Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements
49 applicable to massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.

3 carry out its duties pursuant to this chapter.
4 2. In such a hearing:
5 (a) Any member of the Board may administer oaths and examine witnesses;
6 and
7 (b) The Board , the Executive Director of the Board or any member [thereof]
8 of the Board may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the
9 production of books and papers.
10 3. Each witness who is subpoenaed to appear before the Board is entitled to
11 receive for his or her attendance the same fees and mileage allowed by law for a
12 witness in a civil case. The amount must be paid by the party who requested the
13 subpoena. If any witness who has not been required to attend at the request of any
14 party is subpoenaed by the Board, his or her fees and mileage must be paid by the
15 Board from money available for that purpose.
16 4. If any person fails to comply with the subpoena within 10 days after it is
17 issued, the Chair of the Board may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for an
18 order of the court compelling compliance with the subpoena.
19 5. Upon the filing of such a petition, the court shall enter an order directing
20 the person subpoenaed to appear before the court at a time and place to be fixed by
21 the court in its order, the time to be not more than 10 days after the date of the
22 order, and to show cause why the person has not complied with the subpoena. A
23 certified copy of the order must be served upon the person subpoenaed.
24 6. If it appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued by the
25 Board, the court shall enter an order compelling compliance with the subpoena. The
26 failure of the person to comply with the order is a contempt of the court that issued
27 the order.
28 Sec. 10. NRS 640C.930 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 640C.930 1. A person shall not advertise as a massage therapist,
30 reflexologist or structural integration practitioner in this State unless the person is
31 licensed to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration pursuant
32 to this chapter.
33 2. A person licensed to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
34 integration pursuant to this chapter shall not disseminate, as part of any advertising
35 by the massage therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner, any
36 false or misleading statement or representation of material fact that is intended,
37 directly or indirectly, to induce another person to use the services of the massage
38 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner.
39 3. All advertising by a licensed massage therapist, reflexologist or structural
40 integration practitioner must include his or her name and the name of his or her
41 company, if applicable. All advertising in a telephone directory or a newspaper
42 must also include the number of the license.
43 4. A person shall not advertise a massage, reflexology and structural
44 integration establishment in this State unless the person holds a certificate to
45 operate the massage, reflexology and structural integration establishment issued
46 by the Board pursuant to NRS 640C.330.
47 5. A person who holds a certificate to operate a massage, reflexology and
48 structural integration establishment shall not disseminate, as part of any
49 advertising by the person holding the certificate, any false or misleading
50 statement or representation of material fact that is intended, directly or indirectly,
51 to induce another person to use the services of the massage, reflexology and
52 structural integration establishment.
Senate Amendment No. 323 to Senate Bill No. 386 Page 12
1 6. All advertising by a person who holds a certificate to operate a massage,
2 reflexology and structural integration establishment must include his or her
3 name and the name of the massage, reflexology and structural integration
4 establishment. All advertising in a telephone directory or a newspaper must also
5 include the number of the certificate to operate the massage, reflexology and
6 structural integration establishment.
7 7. A person who violates any provision of subsection 1 , [or] 2 , 4 or 5 is
8 guilty of a misdemeanor.
9 [5.] 8. If, after notice and a hearing as required by law, the Board determines
10 that a person has willfully engaged in advertising in a manner that violates the
11 provisions of this section or NRS 640C.910, the Board may, in addition to any
12 penalty, punishment or disciplinary action authorized by the provisions of this
13 chapter, order the person to cease and desist the unlawful advertising. The
14 provisions of this subsection do not apply to any person whose license has been
15 expired for less than 90 days or is temporarily suspended.
16 [6.] 9. The Board may order any person convicted of a crime involving
17 violence, prostitution or any other sexual offense to cause any telephone number
18 included in the advertising to be disconnected from service. If the Board orders the
19 person to cause any telephone number to be disconnected from service and the
20 person fails to comply within 5 days after the date on which the person is served
21 with the order, the Board may:
22 (a) If the provider is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada,
23 request the Commission to order the provider to disconnect the telephone number
24 from service pursuant to NRS 703.175 and 707.355; or
25 (b) If the provider is not regulated by the Public Utilities Commission of
26 Nevada, request the provider to disconnect the telephone number from service and

32 disconnected from service pursuant to this section; or
33 (b) Provide or offer to provide a message that includes a new telephone
34 number for the person whose telephone number was disconnected from service
35 pursuant to this section.
36 [8.] 11. If a provider complies in good faith with a request to disconnect a
37 telephone number from service pursuant to this section, such good-faith compliance
38 shall constitute a complete defense to any civil or criminal action brought against
39 the provider arising from the disconnection or termination of service.
40 [9.] 12. As used in this section:
41 (a) “Advertising” means the intentional placement or issuance of any sign, card

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to massage therapy; authorizing the Board of Massage Therapy to
issue a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
integration to a person who would not otherwise qualify for such a
license if the person satisfies certain other requirements; revising the
acts which constitute the practice of reflexology; eliminating certain
requirements for meetings of the Board; requiring the Board to adopt
regulations concerning disciplinary actions against the holder of a
certificate of a massage, reflexology and structural integration
establishment; revising provisions governing the issuance of temporary
licenses by the Board; authorizing the Executive Director of the Board
to issue subpoenas; revising provisions governing certain
advertisements; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Massage Therapy to issue licenses to practice
2 massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (Chapter 640C of NRS)
3 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board, after conducting a review of the credentials of
4 an applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to
5 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration, to grant such a license to a
6 person who: (1) has legally practiced massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration in
7 another state, territory or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia for not
8 less than 3 years; (2) submits certain information and documents to the Board; and (3) passes
9 certain examinations. Sections 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate that the
10 provisions of section 1 are exceptions to the general requirements for the issuance of a license
11 to practice massage therapy, a license to practice reflexology and a license to practice
12 structural integration.
13 Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of the term “reflexology” to include the
14 application of a system of pressure to the face of the human body.
15 Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Board alternate the location of its
16 meetings between the southern and northern districts of this State.

Senate Amendment No. 323 to Senate Bill No. 386 Page 4
17 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the requirements for
18 the certification and operation of a massage, reflexology and structural integration
19 establishment. (NRS 640C.330) Section 4 of this bill requires the Board to adopt regulations
20 which include the grounds for the imposition of disciplinary action against the holder of a
21 certificate of a massage, reflexology and structural integration establishment and the
22 disciplinary actions which the Board may impose.
23 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a person to be issued a temporary license
24 to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610,
25 640C.630) Sections 8 and 11 of this bill revise those requirements to instead authorize the
26 Board to issue a temporary license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural
27 integration in this State to a person: (1) who holds an active license in good standing to
28 practice massage therapy, reflexology or structural integration issued by another state,
29 territory or possession of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (2) who satisfies
30 the requirements for a temporary license set forth in regulations adopted by the Board.
31 Section 8 prohibits those regulations from requiring a person to take or pass a written
32 examination concerning his or her qualifications to practice massage therapy, reflexology or
33 structural integration to be issued a temporary license. Existing law provides that a temporary
34 license expires 90 days after issuance and is not renewable. (NRS 640C.590, 640C.610,
35 640C.630) Section 8 authorizes a person who has been issued a temporary license to apply for
36 a new temporary license not less than 3 months after the expiration of the temporary license
37 most recently issued to the person.
38 Existing law authorizes the Board or any member thereof to issue subpoenas to compel
39 the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and papers. (NRS 640C.750) Section
40 9 of this bill additionally authorizes the Executive Director of the Board to issue such
41 subpoenas.
42 Existing law prohibits: (1) an unlicensed person from advertising as a massage therapist,
43 reflexologist or structural integration practitioner; and (2) a licensed person from using any
44 false or misleading statement or representation in advertising that is intended to induce
45 another person to use the services of the massage therapist, reflexologist or structural
46 integration practitioner. Existing law also requires certain advertising by a licensed massage
47 therapist, reflexologist or structural integration practitioner to include certain information.
48 (NRS 640C.930) Section 10 of this bill sets forth similar prohibitions and requirements
49 applicable to massage, reflexology and structural integration establishments.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 640C of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. The Board may, after conducting a review of the credentials of an
4 applicant who does not otherwise satisfy the requirements set forth in NRS
5 640C.580, 640C.600 or 640C.620, as applicable, issue a license to the applicant
6 pursuant to this section.
7 2. An applicant for a license to practice massage therapy, reflexology or
