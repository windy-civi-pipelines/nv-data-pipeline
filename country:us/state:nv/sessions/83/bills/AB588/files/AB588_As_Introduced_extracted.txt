AN ACT relating to legislators; revising the title of a member of the
Assembly to “Assemblymember” in conformance with
the Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing
Rules of the Senate and Assembly; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules of the Senate and
2 Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature change the title of a member of
3 the Nevada Assembly to “Assemblymember,” regardless of the gender of the
4 member. (Assembly Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session, Assembly
5 Concurrent Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session) Consistent with the
6 Rules, this bill revises references to the title of a member of the Assembly to
7 “Assemblymember.” Section 1 of this bill eliminates the provision authorizing a
8 female member of the Assembly to have “Assemblywoman” precede her name on
9 official stationary and business cards. Sections 2-15 of this bill replace the terms
10 “Assemblyman” and “Assemblywoman” with “Assemblymember.”

A.B. 588
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 588–COMMITTEE ON
LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
MAY 19, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to members of the
Assembly of the Nevada Legislature.
(BDR 17-1235)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to legislators; revising the title of a member of the
Assembly to “Assemblymember” in conformance with
the Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing
Rules of the Senate and Assembly; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules of the Senate and
2 Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature change the title of a member of
3 the Nevada Assembly to “Assemblymember,” regardless of the gender of the
4 member. (Assembly Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session, Assembly
5 Concurrent Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session) Consistent with the
6 Rules, this bill revises references to the title of a member of the Assembly to
7 “Assemblymember.” Section 1 of this bill eliminates the provision authorizing a
8 female member of the Assembly to have “Assemblywoman” precede her name on
9 official stationary and business cards. Sections 2-15 of this bill replace the terms
10 “Assemblyman” and “Assemblywoman” with “Assemblymember.”
