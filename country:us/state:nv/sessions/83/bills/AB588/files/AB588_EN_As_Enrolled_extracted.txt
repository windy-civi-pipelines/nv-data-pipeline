Section 1:
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to legislators; revising the title of a member of the
Assembly to “Assemblymember” in conformance with the
Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules of
the Senate and Assembly; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules of the Senate and
Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature change the title of a member of
the Nevada Assembly to “Assemblymember,” regardless of the gender of the
member. (Assembly Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session, Assembly
Concurrent Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session) Consistent with the
Rules, this bill revises references to the title of a member of the Assembly to
“Assemblymember.” Section 1 of this bill eliminates the provision authorizing a
female member of the Assembly to have “Assemblywoman” precede her name on
official stationary and business cards. Sections 2-15 of this bill replace the terms
“Assemblyman” and “Assemblywoman” with “Assemblymember.”

Assembly Bill No. 588–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to legislators; revising the title of a member of the
Assembly to “Assemblymember” in conformance with the
Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules of
the Senate and Assembly; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Assembly Standing Rules and the Joint Standing Rules of the Senate and
Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature change the title of a member of
the Nevada Assembly to “Assemblymember,” regardless of the gender of the
member. (Assembly Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session, Assembly
Concurrent Resolution No. 1 of the 2025 Legislative Session) Consistent with the
Rules, this bill revises references to the title of a member of the Assembly to
“Assemblymember.” Section 1 of this bill eliminates the provision authorizing a
female member of the Assembly to have “Assemblywoman” precede her name on
official stationary and business cards. Sections 2-15 of this bill replace the terms
“Assemblyman” and “Assemblywoman” with “Assemblymember.”
