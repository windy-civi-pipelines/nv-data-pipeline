EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising the manner in which a data
request or report submitted to the Commissioner of
Insurance by certain insurers or other organizations
providing health coverage relating to the compliance of
the insurer or organization with certain federal laws must
be submitted to the Commissioner; revising provisions
governing the confidentiality of information contained in
such a data request or report; setting forth certain
requirements for certain market analyses conducted by the
Commissioner; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and
2 Addiction Equity Act of 2008 prohibits group health plans and health insurance
3 issuers that provide benefits for mental health or substance use disorders from
4 imposing less favorable benefit limitations on those benefits than on medical and
5 surgical benefits. (Pub. L. No. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765) Existing law requires
6 certain health insurers or other organizations providing health coverage to comply
7 with the Act. Existing law additionally requires the Commissioner of Insurance to
8 annually prescribe and provide to each such insurer or other organization a data
9 request that solicits information necessary to evaluate the compliance of an insurer
10 or other organization with the Act. Under existing law, an insurer or other
11 organization is required to either complete the data request and submit it to the
12 Commissioner or submit to the Commissioner a copy of a report submitted to the
13 Federal Government demonstrating compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404) This
14 bill requires the data request or the report to be submitted to the Commissioner in
-
*AB207_R1*
– 2 –
15 accordance with the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing developed and
16 implemented by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
17 Under existing law, any information provided to the Commissioner in the data
18 request or report is confidential. (NRS 687B.404) This bill instead provides that
19 such information is a public record except for personally identifiable information of
20 a consumer and any information determined by the Commissioner to constitute a
21 trade secret, which are confidential. This bill sets forth certain standards for the
22 making of a determination by the Commissioner as to whether information
23 provided to the Commissioner in the data request or report constitutes a trade
24 secret.
25 Finally, this bill requires any market analysis conducted by the Commissioner
26 to determine compliance with the provisions of this bill to be conducted in
27 accordance with applicable standards set forth by the National Association of
28 Insurance Commissioners, all applicable laws and any regulations adopted by the
29 Commissioner.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
