Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising the manner in which a data
request or report submitted to the Commissioner of Insurance
by certain insurers or other organizations providing health
coverage relating to the compliance of the insurer or
organization with certain federal laws must be submitted to
the Commissioner; revising provisions governing the
confidentiality of information contained in such a data
request or report; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and
Addiction Equity Act of 2008 prohibits group health plans and health insurance
issuers that provide benefits for mental health or substance use disorders from
imposing less favorable benefit limitations on those benefits than on medical and
surgical benefits. (Pub. L. No. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765) Existing law requires
certain health insurers or other organizations providing health coverage to comply
with the Act. Existing law additionally requires the Commissioner of Insurance to
annually prescribe and provide to each such insurer or other organization a data
request that solicits information necessary to evaluate the compliance of an insurer
or other organization with the Act. Under existing law, an insurer or other
organization is required to either complete the data request and submit it to the
Commissioner or submit to the Commissioner a copy of a report submitted to the
Federal Government demonstrating compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404) This
bill requires the data request or the report to be submitted to the Commissioner in
accordance with the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing developed and
implemented by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
Under existing law, any information provided to the Commissioner in the data
request or report is confidential. (NRS 687B.404) This bill instead provides that
such information is a public record except for personally identifiable information of
a consumer and any information determined by the Commissioner to constitute a
trade secret, which are confidential. This bill sets forth certain standards for the
making of a determination by the Commissioner as to whether information
provided to the Commissioner in the data request or report constitutes a trade
secret.
