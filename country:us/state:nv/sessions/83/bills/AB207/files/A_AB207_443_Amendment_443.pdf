EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising the manner in which a data request or
report submitted to the Commissioner of Insurance by certain insurers
or other organizations providing health coverage relating to the
compliance of the insurer or organization with certain federal laws
must be submitted to the Commissioner; revising provisions governing
the confidentiality of information contained in such a data request or
report; setting forth certain requirements for certain market
analyses conducted by the Commissioner; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction
2 Equity Act of 2008 prohibits group health plans and health insurance issuers that provide
3 benefits for mental health or substance use disorders from imposing less favorable benefit
4 limitations on those benefits than on medical and surgical benefits. (Pub. L. No. 110-343, 122
5 Stat. 3765) Existing law requires certain health insurers or other organizations providing
6 health coverage to comply with the Act. Existing law additionally requires the Commissioner
7 of Insurance to annually prescribe and provide to each such insurer or other organization a
8 data request that solicits information necessary to evaluate the compliance of an insurer or
9 other organization with the Act. Under existing law, an insurer or other organization is
10 required to either complete the data request and submit it to the Commissioner or submit to
11 the Commissioner a copy of a report submitted to the Federal Government demonstrating
12 compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404) This bill requires the data request or the report to
13 be submitted to the Commissioner in accordance with the System for Electronic Rate and
14 Form Filing developed and implemented by the National Association of Insurance
15 Commissioners.
16 Under existing law, any information provided to the Commissioner in the data request or
17 report is confidential. (NRS 687B.404) This bill instead provides that [only the] such
18 information is a public record except for personally identifiable information of a consumer
19 [that is provided by an insurer or other organization to] and any information determined by
20 the Commissioner [in the data request or report is] to constitute a trade secret, which are
21 confidential. This bill sets forth certain standards for the making of a determination by

Assembly Amendment No. 443 to Assembly Bill No. 207 Page 4
22 the Commissioner as to whether information provided to the Commissioner in the data
23 request or report constitutes a trade secret.
24 Finally, this bill requires any market analysis conducted by the Commissioner to
25 determine compliance with the provisions of this bill to be conducted in accordance with
26 applicable standards set forth by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
27 all applicable laws and any regulations adopted by the Commissioner.

24 Electronic Rate and Form Filing developed and implemented by the National

1 and the number and percentage of denials of claims, constitutes a trade secret

7 constitutes a trade secret must be resolved in favor of a determination that the
8 information does not constitute a trade secret.

10 compliance with the provisions of this section must be conducted in accordance
11 with applicable standards set forth by the National Association of Insurance
12 Commissioners, all applicable laws and any regulations adopted by the
