EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising the manner in which a data
request or report submitted to the Commissioner of
Insurance by certain insurers or other organizations
providing health coverage relating to the compliance of
the insurer or organization with certain federal laws must
be submitted to the Commissioner; revising provisions
governing the confidentiality of information contained in
such a data request or report; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and
2 Addiction Equity Act of 2008 prohibits group health plans and health insurance
3 issuers that provide benefits for mental health or substance use disorders from
4 imposing less favorable benefit limitations on those benefits than on medical and
5 surgical benefits. (Pub. L. No. 110-343, 122 Stat. 3765) Existing law requires
6 certain health insurers or other organizations providing health coverage to comply
7 with the Act. Existing law additionally requires the Commissioner of Insurance to
8 annually prescribe and provide to each such insurer or other organization a data
9 request that solicits information necessary to evaluate the compliance of an insurer
10 or other organization with the Act. Under existing law, an insurer or other
11 organization is required to either complete the data request and submit it to the
12 Commissioner or submit to the Commissioner a copy of a report submitted to the
13 Federal Government demonstrating compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404) This
14 bill requires the data request or the report to be submitted to the Commissioner in
15 accordance with the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing developed and
16 implemented by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
