EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; revising provisions which prohibit
certain insurers from discriminating based on the breed of
a dog at certain properties; revising provisions relating to
the supportive housing grant program implemented by the
Housing Division of the Department of Business and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits an insurer from refusing to issue, cancelling, refusing to
2 renew or increasing the premium or rate for certain policies of insurance on the sole
3 basis of the specific breed or mixture of breeds of a dog that is harbored or owned
4 on an applicable property unless, pursuant to the public health laws of this State,
5 the particular dog: (1) is known to be dangerous or vicious; or (2) has been declared
6 to be dangerous or vicious. (NRS 687B.383) Section 1 of this bill expands this
7 prohibition: (1) by removing the limitation that the specific breed or mixture of
8 breeds of a dog be the sole basis for taking the prohibited action; and (2) to include
9 a policy of insurance which covers a multi-family residential dwelling.
10 Existing law requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
11 Industry, subject to the availability of funds, to develop and implement a supportive
12 housing grant program for the purpose of awarding grants for the development of
13 supportive housing and the provision of supportive housing services. (NRS
14 319.600, 319.610) Section 2 of this bill requires any recipient of a grant for
15 supportive housing to agree in writing to allow a tenant in the supportive housing to
16 keep at least one pet, subject to any applicable federal, state and local laws,
17 regulations and ordinances relating to public health, animal control or the
18 prevention of cruelty to animals.
