Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits an insurer from refusing to issue, cancelling, refusing to renew or
2 increasing the premium or rate for certain policies of insurance on the sole basis of the
3 specific breed or mixture of breeds of a dog that is harbored or owned on an applicable
4 property unless, pursuant to the public health laws of this State, the particular dog: (1) is
5 known to be dangerous or vicious; or (2) has been declared to be dangerous or vicious. (NRS
6 687B.383) Section 1 of this bill expands this prohibition : (1) by removing the limitation
7 that the specific breed or mixture of breeds of a dog be the sole basis for taking the
8 prohibited action; and (2) to include a policy of insurance which covers a multi-family
9 residential dwelling.
10 Existing law requires the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry,
11 subject to the availability of funds, to develop and implement a supportive housing grant
12 program for the purpose of awarding grants for the development of supportive housing and the
13 provision of supportive housing services. (NRS 319.600, 319.610) Section 2 of this bill
14 requires any recipient of a grant for supportive housing to agree in writing to allow a tenant in
15 the supportive housing to keep at least one pet [.] , subject to any applicable federal, state
16 and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to public health, animal control or
17 the prevention of cruelty to animals.
