2 Standards of the Department of Business and Industry and sets forth the powers and
3 duties of the Office. (NRS 232.8413, 232.8415) Existing law provides, with certain
4 exceptions, that all professional and occupational licensing boards created by the
5 Legislature are under the purview of the Office. (NRS 232.8415) Section 8 of this
6 bill removes the Commission on Postsecondary Education of the Employment

9 Section 5 of this bill authorizes the Office to: (1) prescribe a fee to cover the
10 costs incurred by the Office for any service provided by the Office to a professional
11 or occupational licensing board under the purview of the Office; and (2) adopt such
12 procedures as the Office may deem appropriate for the billing or collection of such
13 fees from a professional or occupational licensing board to which such a service is
14 provided. Section 5 requires all money collected by the Office from such fees to be
15 deposited in the State Treasury for credit to the Office of Nevada Boards,
16 Commissions and Councils Standards Account, which is created by section 6 of
17 this bill.
18 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of the
19 provisions of this bill and the provisions of existing law governing the Office.
20 Section 2 of this bill makes the definitions in sections 3 and 4 apply to the
21 provisions of this bill and the provisions of existing law governing the Office.
22 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions applicable
23 to existing provisions governing the Department of Business and Industry to the
24 provisions of sections 2-6.
25 Existing law requires certain taxicab motor carriers to charge, collect and remit
26 to the Nevada Transportation Authority a technology fee in amount set by the
27 Nevada Transportation Authority. (NRS 706.471) For a certificate holder who is
28 subject to an order of allocation by the Taxicab Authority, the amount of the
29 technology fee is required to be set by the Taxicab Authority and the fee is required
30 to be paid to the Taxicab Authority. (NRS 706.8826) Section 8.3 of this bill revises
31 provisions of existing law governing such a technology fee to specify that the
32 amount of the fee may be set by the Nevada Transportation Authority or the
33 Taxicab Authority, as applicable, and the fee must be paid to the appropriate,
34 applicable entity.
35 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions governing the
36 operation of taxicab motor carriers. (Chapter 706 of NRS) Existing law also sets
37 forth requirements and restrictions governing the operation of transportation
38 network companies. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Section 8.7 of this bill authorizes a
39 transportation network company to enter into an agreement with a taxicab motor
40 carrier or a person that provides electronic hailing services for a taxicab motor
41 carrier for the carrier to receive from the company connections to potential
42 passengers through the digital network or software application services of the
43 company in exchange for a fee provided to the company. Under section 8.7, a trip
44 undertaken by a taxicab motor carrier as the result of a connection provided
45 pursuant to such an agreement is not subject to the provisions of existing law
46 governing transportation network companies. Rather, section 8.7 provides, with
47 certain exceptions, that such a trip is subject to the provisions of existing law
48 governing taxicab motor carriers.
