EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the Office of Nevada
Boards, Commissions and Councils Standards of the Department of
Business and Industry to adopt regulations prescribing a fee for any
service provided by the Office to a professional or occupational
licensing board under the purview of the Office; removing the
Commission on Postsecondary Education of the Employment Security
Division of the Department of Employment, Training and
Rehabilitation from the purview of the Office; revising provisions
governing technology fees imposed on each compensable trip by a
taxicab; authorizing a transportation network company and a
taxicab motor carrier or person who provides electronic hailing
services to a taxicab motor carrier to enter into certain
agreements; setting forth certain requirements for a trip resulting
from such an agreement; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Office of Nevada Boards, Commissions and Councils Standards
2 of the Department of Business and Industry and sets forth the powers and duties of the Office.
3 (NRS 232.8413, 232.8415) Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that all
4 professional and occupational licensing boards created by the Legislature are under the
5 purview of the Office. (NRS 232.8415) Section 8 of this bill removes the Commission on
6 Postsecondary Education of the Employment Security Division of the Department of
7 Employment, Training and Rehabilitation from the purview of the Office.
8 Section 5 of this bill authorizes the Office to: (1) prescribe a fee to cover the costs
9 incurred by the Office for any service provided by the Office to a professional or occupational
10 licensing board under the purview of the Office; and (2) adopt such procedures as the Office
11 may deem appropriate for the billing or collection of such fees from a professional or
12 occupational licensing board to which such a service is provided. Section 5 requires all money
13 collected by the Office from such fees to be deposited in the State Treasury for credit to the
Senate Amendment No. 941 to Senate Bill No. 507 Page 4
14 Office of Nevada Boards, Commissions and Councils Standards Account, which is created by
15 section 6 of this bill.
16 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define certain terms for the purposes of the provisions of this
17 bill and the provisions of existing law governing the Office. Section 2 of this bill makes the
18 definitions in sections 3 and 4 apply to the provisions of this bill and the provisions of
19 existing law governing the Office. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply
20 the definitions applicable to existing provisions governing the Department of Business and
21 Industry to the provisions of sections 2-6.
22 Existing law requires certain taxicab motor carriers to charge, collect and remit to
23 the Nevada Transportation Authority a technology fee in amount set by the Nevada
24 Transportation Authority. (NRS 706.471) For a certificate holder who is subject to an
25 order of allocation by the Taxicab Authority, the amount of the technology fee is
26 required to be set by the Taxicab Authority and the fee is required to be paid to the
27 Taxicab Authority. (NRS 706.8826) Section 8.3 of this bill revises provisions of existing
28 law governing such a technology fee to specify that the amount of the fee may be set by
29 the Nevada Transportation Authority or the Taxicab Authority, as applicable, and the
30 fee must be paid to the appropriate, applicable entity.
31 Existing law sets forth various requirements and restrictions governing the
32 operation of taxicab motor carriers. (Chapter 706 of NRS) Existing law also sets forth
33 requirements and restrictions governing the operation of transportation network
34 companies. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Section 8.7 of this bill authorizes a transportation
35 network company to enter into an agreement with a taxicab motor carrier or a person
36 that provides electronic hailing services for a taxicab motor carrier for the carrier to
37 receive from the company connections to potential passengers through the digital
38 network or software application services of the company in exchange for a fee provided
39 to the company. Under section 8.7, a trip undertaken by a taxicab motor carrier as the
40 result of a connection provided pursuant to such an agreement is not subject to the
41 provisions of existing law governing transportation network companies. Rather, section
42 8.7 provides, with certain exceptions, that such a trip is subject to the provisions of
43 existing law governing taxicab motor carriers.
