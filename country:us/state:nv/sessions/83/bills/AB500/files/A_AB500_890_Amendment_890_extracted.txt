44 the Commissioner’s approval. If the Commissioner approves the liquidation, the

38 appointment, it shall have and possess all the powers and privileges provided by
39 the laws of this State with respect to a receiver or liquidator, respectively, of a
40 payments bank, its depositors and other creditors, and is subject to all the duties

Assembly Amendment No. 890 to Assembly Bill No. 500 Page 39
1 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
2 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
3 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not

5 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
6 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
7 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

9 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
10 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
11 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
12 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity

21 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
22 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
23 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an

26 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
27 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
28 otherwise confidential.
29 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
30 custody or control of a public record:
31 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
32 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
33 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
35 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
36 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

50 appropriation is made or any entity to which money from the appropriation is
51 granted or otherwise transferred in any manner, and any portion of the
52 appropriated money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after

38 appointment, it shall have and possess all the powers and privileges provided by
39 the laws of this State with respect to a receiver or liquidator, respectively, of a
40 payments bank, its depositors and other creditors, and is subject to all the duties

12 account of inability to meet the demands of its depositors, by action of the
13 Commissioner, by action of a court, by action of its directors or due to its
14 insolvency or suspension, the Commissioner, or the receiver or liquidator of the
15 payments bank with the permission of the Commissioner, may borrow from the
16 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and furnish any part or all of the assets
17 of the payments bank to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as security

9 bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, is taken over for liquidation by
10 the Commissioner, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by any other
11 legally constituted authority, the powers and duties of the payments bank as
12 trustee cease upon the entry of an order of the district court appointing a
13 successor trustee pursuant to a petition as provided for in sections 109 to 114,
14 inclusive, of this act.
15 2. If an indenture, deed of trust or other instrument of like character that
16 appoints a payments bank as trustee pursuant to subsection 1 includes a
17 provision which provides for the appointment of a successor trustee if the
18 payments bank is taken over for liquidation, the powers and duties of the
19 payments bank as trustee cease upon being taken over by the Commissioner, the
20 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other legally constituted authority
21 and the successor trustee named, or whose selection is provided for, in the

29 service on all interested parties, personally or by the publication in a newspaper
30 published in the county, or in some adjoining county if no newspaper is published
31 in the county where the application is made, of a notice directed to all persons
32 concerned, commanding and requiring all persons having any interest in the
33 trust, to appear in court on a day designated in the order and notice, not less than
34 30 days after the date of the order and notice, to show cause why a new trustee
35 should not be appointed.
36 2. Such notice must be published in the manner required by the Nevada
37 Rules of Civil Procedure for service of summons by publication, and shall set
38 forth the names of the parties to the indenture, deed of trust or other such
39 instrument, the date thereof, and the place or places where such instrument is
40 recorded.
41 Sec. 110. If, upon the day fixed in the order and notice, no person appears
42 and objects to the appointment of a substitute trustee, the district court shall,
43 upon such terms as it deems advisable to serve the best interest of all interested
44 parties, appoint some competent person, or corporation authorized to act as a

10 105, inclusive, of this act, exercises the power of sale set up in any mortgage,
11 deed of trust or other written instrument for the security of the payment of money
12 in which any payments bank then in liquidation was named trustee, the exercise
13 of the power of sale and the acts of resigning the trust, of the Commissioner, the
14 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the appointed liquidating agent have
15 the same effect as if done by the payments bank named as trustee in the
16 mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument.
17 Sec. 116. When the Commissioner or the Federal Deposit Insurance
18 Corporation has taken possession of any payments bank, the payments bank may,

31 2. Upon the filing of articles of incorporation or organization in the same
32 manner as provided for the organization of new payments banks, the reorganized
33 payments bank is a payments bank under the laws of this State. Upon
34 reorganization, all assets, real and personal, of the dissolved payments bank, by

36 bank, subject to all liabilities of the payments bank existing before the
37 reorganization.

22 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
23 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an

27 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
28 otherwise confidential.
29 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
30 custody or control of a public record:
31 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
32 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
33 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
35 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
36 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

49 after June 30 of the respective fiscal years by the entity to which the
50 appropriation is made or any entity to which money from the appropriation is
51 granted or otherwise transferred in any manner, and any portion of the
52 appropriated money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after
53 September 18, 2026, and September 17, 2027, respectively, by either the entity

1 to which the money was appropriated or the entity to which the money was
2 subsequently granted or transferred, and must be reverted to the State
3 General Fund on or before September 18, 2026, and September 17, 2027,
4 respectively.
