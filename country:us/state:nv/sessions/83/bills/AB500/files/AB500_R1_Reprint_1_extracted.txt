18 law of this State, or is conducting its business in an unsafe or
19 injurious manner, he or she may by an order addressed to such
20 payments bank direct a discontinuance of such violations or
21 unsafe or injurious practices and a conformity with all the
22 requirements of law.
23 2. If a payments bank does not comply with such order, the
24 Commissioner may order the corporate secretary to call a special
25 directors’ meeting to consider the matter of noncompliance.
26 3. The meeting must be held no later than 60 days after
27 issuance of the order to hold the meeting, unless otherwise
28 restrained by court order or by the board. The business of the
29 meeting must be limited to the matter of noncompliance and

29 payments bank, a certified copy of all proceedings of the meeting
30 at which that action is taken, verified by the oath of the president
31 or a manager, must be transmitted to the Commissioner for the
32 Commissioner’s approval. If the Commissioner approves the
33 liquidation, the Commissioner shall issue to the payments bank,
34 under the Commissioner’s seal, a permit for that purpose. No
35 permit may be issued by the Commissioner until the Commissioner
36 is satisfied that provision has been made by the payments bank to
37 satisfy and pay off all depositors and all creditors of the payments
38 bank. If the Commissioner is not satisfied, the Commissioner shall
39 not issue a permit, but the Commissioner may take possession of

30 payments bank will be determined in accordance with the

24 act, exercises the power of sale set up in any mortgage, deed of
25 trust or other written instrument for the security of the payment of
26 money in which any payments bank then in liquidation was named
27 trustee, the exercise of the power of sale and the acts of resigning
