Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county or city clerk to
recruit election board officers for a polling place established
within the boundaries of an Indian reservation or Indian
colony unless the Indian tribe affirmatively declines to have
the county or city clerk perform such a duty; requiring a
county or city clerk to ensure that instruction concerning
mechanical voting systems is provided to such election board
officers under certain conditions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes an Indian tribe to submit a request to a county or city
clerk to establish a polling place or ballot drop box within the boundaries of an
Indian reservation or Indian colony on the day of an election or for early voting.
(NRS 293.2733, 293.3572, 293C.2675, 293C.3572) Existing law further requires a
county or city clerk to schedule certain meetings with each Indian tribe located in
whole or in part within the county or city, as applicable, to discuss certain details
relating to the next regularly scheduled election cycle and provides that such a
meeting may address, without limitation, recruitment of election board officers.
(NRS 293.269905, 293C.2625) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require a county or city
clerk to, regardless of whether such a meeting addresses responsibilities for the
recruitment of election board officers, recruit such election board officers unless the
Indian tribe affirmatively declines to have the county or city clerk perform such a
duty.
Existing law requires a county or city clerk to, within a reasonable time before
each election, instruct the members of the election board in the use of a mechanical
voting system and in their duties in connection therewith. (NRS 293B.260) Section
2 of this bill requires each county or city clerk to ensure that such instruction is
provided to members of an election board that are appointed to staff a polling place
which will be established within the boundaries of an Indian reservation or Indian
colony by providing at least one training class: (1) within the boundaries of the
Indian reservation or Indian colony, unless the Indian tribe elects not to have the
training class conducted in such a manner; and (2) in a manner that is accessible to
a member of the election board in person or remotely.
