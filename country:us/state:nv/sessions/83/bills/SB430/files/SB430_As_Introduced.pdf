AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the issuance of
transferable tax credits and the partial abatement of
certain taxes for certain projects of single-family
residences; exempting such residences from the taxes on
real property and transfers of such residences from the
taxes on transfers of real property in certain
circumstances; prohibiting the sale of such residences to
certain corporate investors; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, financial institutions and other employers are required to
2 pay an excise tax (the modified business tax) on wages paid by them. (NRS
3 363A.130, 363B.110) Existing law provides for the imposition and administration
4 of sales and use taxes pursuant to the Sales and Use Tax Act and the Local School
5 Support Tax Law. (Chapters 372 and 374 of NRS) Any amendment to the Local
6 School Support Tax Law also applies to other sales and use taxes imposed under
7 existing law. (NRS 354.705, 374A.020, 376A.060, 377.040, 377A.030, 377B.110,
8 543.600; and various special and local acts) Sections 2-13 of this bill authorize the
9 Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry to approve
10 applications for the issuance of transferable tax credits and granting of abatements
11 of the excise tax on employers other than financial institutions or local sales and
12 use taxes imposed pursuant to the Local School Support Tax Law that are
13 submitted by a project sponsor engaged in a project for the acquisition,
14 development and construction of single-family residences to be sold for the direct
15 cost of the residences to households who will occupy the residences and whose
16 income is less than 130 percent of the area median income. Section 9 authorizes the
17 project sponsor, on behalf of the project, to apply to the Division for these tax
-

18 incentives. Sections 9 and 19 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of certain
19 information in the application and for the adoption of regulations. Section 9
20 authorizes the Division to approve such an application if the Division finds that the
21 project meets the qualifications.
22 If the Division approves an application for transferable tax credits, section 10
23 requires the Division to issue to the project sponsor in the qualified project a
24 certificate of eligibility for transferable tax credits. Section 10 provides that a
25 project is eligible for transferable tax credits in an amount equivalent to the costs of
26 financial assistance provided by the project sponsor to purchasers of single-family
27 residences. Section 10 also provides that the expiration of the transferable tax
28 credits is 4 years after the date of issuance to the project sponsor.
29 If the Division approves an application for an abatement, section 11 provides
30 that the project sponsor is entitled to an abatement of: (1) employer excise taxes for
31 a period of not more than 10 years in an amount equal to the amount of the
32 employer excise taxes that would otherwise be owed for the project; and (2) certain
33 local sales and use taxes for a period of not more than 20 years and in an amount
34 equal to those local sales and use taxes that would otherwise be owed in the county
35 in which the project is located. Sections 15 and 16 of this bill make conforming
36 changes as a result of the authorization of these abatements.
37 Section 12 requires the project sponsor to repay any portion of transferable tax
38 credits and any portion of an abatement to which the project sponsor is not entitled
39 if the Division determines that the project sponsor becomes ineligible for the
40 incentives. Section 13 requires the Division to prepare and submit to the
41 Legislature certain reports concerning any tax incentives provided to a project
42 pursuant to sections 2-13.
43 Existing law provides for the assessment of ad valorem taxes on certain real
44 and personal property and provides certain exemptions from those taxes. (Chapter
45 361 of NRS) Section 14 of this bill provides an exemption from the tax on real
46 property for the initial owner of a single-family residence constructed as part of a
47 project approved pursuant to sections 2-13. The Nevada Constitution requires the
48 Legislature to provide a specific date on which an exemption from property taxes
49 will cease to be effective. (Nev. Const. Art. 10, § 6) To comply with this
50 requirement, section 14 prohibits an application for an exemption pursuant to that
51 section from being submitted on or after July 1, 2055. However, an exemption
52 granted pursuant to an application submitted before July 1, 2055, would continue to
53 be in effect until the owner of the residence no longer qualifies for the exemption.
54 Existing law provides for the imposition of taxes on transfers of real property
55 and exempts certain transfers from such taxes. (NRS 375.020, 375.023, 375.026,
56 375.090) Section 17 of this bill exempts the initial transfers of single-family
57 residences constructed in a project approved pursuant to sections 2-13 from the real
58 property transfer tax.
59 Section 18 of this bill prohibits the initial purchaser of a single-family
60 residence in a project approved pursuant to sections 2-13 from selling the single-
61 family residence to a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an
62 entity.
63 The Nevada Constitution prohibits the Legislature from enacting an exemption
64 from property taxes and sales and use taxes unless the Legislature makes certain
65 findings regarding the benefits and effects of the exemption. (Nev. Const. Art. 10, §
66 6) Section 20 of this bill sets forth such findings of the Legislature with respect to
67 any such exemption provided in this bill.

4 711.600, and section 9 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter
5 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes
6 of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
7 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
8 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
9 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
10 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
11 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
12 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
13 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
14 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
15 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
16 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
17 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
18 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
19 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
20 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
21 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
22 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
23 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
24 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
25 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
26 electronically, the confidential information from the information
27 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
28 confidential.
29 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
30 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
31 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
32 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
33 means of an electronic medium if:
34 (a) The public record:
35 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
36 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
37 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
38 means of an electronic medium would:
39 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
40 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
41 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
42 information that is not otherwise confidential.
43 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
44 has legal custody or control of a public record:
-
*SB430*

– 13 –
1 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
2 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
3 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
4 medium.
5 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
6 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
7 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
8 or herself.
9 Sec. 20. The Legislature hereby finds that the exemption
10 provided by this act from any ad valorem tax on property:
11 1. Will achieve a bona fide social or economic purpose and that
12 the benefits of the exemption are expected to exceed any adverse
13 effect of the exemption on the provision of services to the public by
14 the State or a local government that would otherwise receive
15 revenue from the tax from which the exemption would be granted;
16 and
17 2. Will not impair adversely the ability of the State or a local
18 government to pay, when due, all interest and principal on any
19 outstanding bonds or any other obligations for which revenue from
20 the tax from which the exemption would be granted was pledged.
21 Sec. 21. The provisions of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to any
22 provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a
23 report to the Legislature.
24 Sec. 22. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and
25 approval.
26 2. Sections 1 to 21, inclusive, of this act become effective upon
27 passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations
28 and performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are
29 necessary to carry out the provisions of this act, and on October 1,
30 2025, for all other purposes, and expire by limitation on October 1,
31 2055.
