AN ACT relating to athletics; requiring certain schools and
institutions of higher education to designate by sex the
athletic teams and sports sponsored by the schools or
institutions; prohibiting male or female athletes from
competing on teams designated for the other sex;
prohibiting certain actions from being brought against a
school or institution for maintaining a separate athletic
team or sport designated for pupils and students of the
female or male sex; establishing certain causes of action;
establishing the statute of limitations for such actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs athletics in schools and in institutions of higher education.
2 (Chapters 385B and 398 of NRS) Section 5 of this bill requires a public school or a
3 private school that competes against a public school to designate, based on
4 biological sex at birth, each athletic team or sport that is sponsored by the school as
5 being for males, for females or for both males and females. Section 5 prohibits
6 such a school from opening an athletic team or sport that is designated for females
7 or males to participation by members of the other sex. Section 6 of this bill
8 provides that a school’s compliance with section 5 does not constitute
9 discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity or expression under any state
10 statute or local ordinance. Section 6 also prohibits certain entities that oversee
11 athletic teams and sports that are sponsored by public schools from taking certain
12 adverse actions against a school for maintaining a separate athletic team or sport for
13 females or males. Sections 10 and 11 of this bill establish similar provisions
14 applicable to public and private institutions of higher education. Sections 3, 4 and
15 9 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the
16 applicability of the definitions set forth in sections 3 and 4.

– 2 –
17 Section 7 of this bill authorizes a pupil to bring a civil action against: (1) a
18 school for a violation of sections 2-7; or (2) a school or athletic association or
19 organization for retaliating against the pupil for reporting a violation of sections 2-
20 7 to the school, athletic association or organization or a state or federal agency with
21 oversight of the school. Section 7 additionally authorizes a school to bring a civil
22 action against a governmental entity, licensing or accrediting organization or
23 athletic association or organization for a violation of sections 2-7. Section 7
24 establishes: (1) the period within which such a civil action must be filed; and (2) the
25 types of relief available in such a civil action. Section 12 of this bill establishes
26 similar provisions applicable to public and private institutions of higher education.
1 WHEREAS, In 2018, Communicative & Integrative Biology
2 published an article titled “Only two sex forms but multiple gender
3 variants: How to explain?” which stated that “with respect to
4 biological sex, one is either male or female”; and
5 WHEREAS, In 2021, BJPsych Bulletin published an article titled
6 “Sex, gender and gender identity: a re-evaluation of the evidence,”
7 which explained that the sex of a natural person “is determined at
8 fertili[z]ation and revealed at birth or, increasingly, in utero”; and
9 WHEREAS, In 2012, Chromosome Research published an article
10 titled “Mammalian sex determination-insights from humans and
11 mice,” which stated that “biological differences between males and
12 females are determined genetically during embryonic development”;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, In 2021, Sports Medicine published an article titled
15 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
16 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage,” which
17 asserted that the “[s]econdary sex characteristics that develop during
18 puberty . . . generate anatomical divergence beyond the reproductive
19 system, leading to adult body types that are measurably different
20 between sexes”; and
21 WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court has declared there
22 are inherent differences between men and women and these
23 differences are “cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the
24 members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual’s
25 opportunity” (United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996));
26 and
27 WHEREAS, In 2016, the European Journal of Sport Science
28 published an article titled “Physical fitness normative values for 6-
29 18-year-old Greek boys and girls, using the empirical distribution
30 and the lambda, mu, and sigma statistical method” and in 2011, the
31 British Journal of Sports Medicine published an article titled
32 “Normative health-related fitness values for children: Analysis of
33 85347 test results on 9-17-year-old Australians since 1985,” which
34 discussed studies of large cohorts of children who were between 6
35 and 19 years of age and found that boys typically scored higher than
-
*SB112*

– 3 –
1 girls on cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular
2 endurance and speed and agility but lower on flexibility; and
3 WHEREAS, In 2017, the International Journal of Sports
4 Physiology and Performance published an article titled “Sex
5 Differences in World Record Performance: The Influence of Sport
6 Discipline and Competition Duration,” which concluded that the
7 physiological differences between males and females that are
8 relevant to performance in sports “include a larger body size with
9 more skeletal muscle mass, a lower percentage of body fat, as well
10 as greater maximal delivery of anaerobic and aerobic energy”; and
11 WHEREAS, In 2017, Law and Contemporary Problems
12 published an article titled “Sex in Sport” that explained that men
13 having higher natural levels of testosterone is significant because it
14 affects traits such as “hemoglobin levels, body fat content, ‘the
15 absolute ability to store and use carbohydrate,’ and the development
16 of ‘Type 2 muscle fibers, which are used to generate speed and
17 power’ ”; and
18 WHEREAS, The article published in Sports Medicine titled
19 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
20 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage” also
21 explained that there is a gap between males and females with regard
22 to performance in sports such that the physiological advantages
23 conferred on males by biological sex “appear, on assessment of
24 performance data, [to be] insurmountable”; and
25 WHEREAS, The United States Supreme Court has also declared
26 that while classifications based on sex are generally disfavored,
27 “[s]ex classifications may be used to compensate women for
28 particular economic disabilities [they have] suffered, to promot[e]
29 equal employment opportunity, [and] to advance full development
30 of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people” (United States v.
31 Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (alteration in original) (internal
32 citations and quotations omitted); and
33 WHEREAS, One area where sex classifications allow for the full
34 development of the talent and capacities of our Nation’s people is in
35 the context of sports and athletics; and
36 WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of Rhode Island and the Illinois
37 Fourth District Appeals Court have recognized that the inherent,
38 physiological differences between males and females result in
39 different athletic capabilities (Kleczek v. R.I. Interscholastic League,
40 Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 738 (R.I. 1992); Petrie v. Ill. High Sch. Ass’n,
41 394 N.E.2d 855, 861); and
42 WHEREAS, The article published in Sports Medicine titled
43 “Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives
44 on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage” also
45 explained that the benefits that natural testosterone provides to male
-
*SB112*

– 4 –
1 athletes are not significantly diminished through the use of
2 testosterone suppression; and
3 WHEREAS, That article found that policies like those of the
4 International Olympic Committee requiring biological males to
5 undergo at least 1 year of testosterone suppression before competing
6 in women’s sports do not create a level playing field; and
7 WHEREAS, That article concluded that the reduction in
8 testosterone levels required by policies like those of the
9 International Olympic Committee “is insufficient to remove or
10 reduce the male advantage, in terms of muscle mass and strength, by
11 any meaningful degree”; and
12 WHEREAS, That article concluded “that superior anthropometric,
13 muscle mass and strength parameters achieved by males at puberty,
14 and underpinning a considerable portion of the male performance
15 advantage over females, are not removed by the current regimen of
16 testosterone suppression” permitted by the International Olympic
17 Committee and other sports organizations; and
18 WHEREAS, That article instead found that “male performance
19 advantage remains substantial” and “raises obvious concerns about
20 fair and safe competition”; and
21 WHEREAS, Having separate sex-specific teams furthers efforts to
22 promote equality between the sexes by providing opportunities for
23 female athletes to demonstrate their skill, strength and athletic
24 abilities while also providing them with opportunities to obtain
25 recognition, accolades, college scholarships and the numerous other
26 long-term benefits that flow from success in athletic endeavors; and
27 WHEREAS, If males were permitted to compete in female sports,
28 the risk of injury to females would be increased by the ability of a
29 biological male to exert greater force, strength and power, and also
30 by females’ reduced ability to receive or tolerate that force; and
31 WHEREAS, Separating participants in contact sports based on
32 biological sex promotes the safety of female athletes by protecting
33 them from predictable and preventable injuries caused by male
34 athletes; now, therefore,
35
36 THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
