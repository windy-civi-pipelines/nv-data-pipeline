EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising the term “heir” for certain
purposes relating to civil actions; eliminating the statute
of limitations for certain civil actions arising from a death
caused by homicide; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, for the purposes of allowing an heir to maintain an action for
2 damages for a death caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another person,
3 defines the term “heir” to mean a person who would be entitled to succeed to the
4 separate property of a decedent if the decedent had died intestate. (NRS 41.085)
5 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “heir” to mean a person who, at the
6 time such an action for damages is brought, would be entitled to succeed to the
7 separate property of the decedent.
8 Existing law generally requires a civil action to recover damages for injuries to
9 or the death of a person arising from the wrongful act or neglect of another person
10 to be commenced not later than 2 years after the date on which the wrongful act or
11 neglect occurred. (NRS 11.190) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a civil action
12 to recover damages for the death of a decedent to be brought by the heirs and the
13 personal representatives of the decedent at any time upon a showing by a
14 preponderance of evidence that the death of the decedent was a homicide
15 committed by a wrongdoer. Section 3 of this bill provides that the amendatory
16 provisions of this bill apply retroactively to any cause of action to recover damages
17 for death caused by homicide that accrues before, on or after the effective date of
18 this bill.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.085 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 41.085 1. As used in this section, “heir” means a person who,
3 under the laws of this State, at the time an action is brought
4 pursuant to subsection 2, would be entitled to succeed to the
5 separate property of the decedent if the decedent had died intestate.
6 The term does not include a person who is deemed to be a killer of
7 the decedent pursuant to chapter 41B of NRS, and such a person
8 shall be deemed to have predeceased the decedent as set forth in
9 NRS 41B.330.
10 2. When the death of any person, whether or not a minor, is
11 caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, the heirs of the
12 decedent and the personal representatives of the decedent may each
13 maintain an action for damages against the person who caused the
14 death, or if the wrongdoer is dead, against the wrongdoer’s personal
15 representatives, whether the wrongdoer died before or after the
16 death of the person injured by the wrongdoer. If any other person is
17 responsible for the wrongful act or neglect, or if the wrongdoer is
18 employed by another person who is responsible for the wrongdoer’s
19 conduct, the action may be maintained against that other person, or
20 if the other person is dead, against the other person’s personal
21 representatives.
22 3. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent and the
23 personal representatives of a decedent pursuant to subsection 2
24 may be commenced at any time upon a showing by a
25 preponderance of evidence that the death of the decedent was a
26 homicide committed by the wrongdoer.
27 4. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent pursuant to
28 subsection 2 and the cause of action of that decedent brought or
29 maintained by the decedent’s personal representatives which arose
30 out of the same wrongful act or neglect may be joined.
31 [4.] 5. The heirs may prove their respective damages in the
32 action brought pursuant to subsection 2 and the court or jury may
33 award each person pecuniary damages for the person’s grief or
34 sorrow, loss of probable support, companionship, society, comfort
35 and consortium, and damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement of
36 the decedent. The proceeds of any judgment for damages awarded
37 under this subsection are not liable for any debt of the decedent.
38 [5.] 6. The damages recoverable by the personal
39 representatives of a decedent on behalf of the decedent’s estate
40 include:
