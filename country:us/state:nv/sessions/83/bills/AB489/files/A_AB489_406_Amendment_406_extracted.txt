AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising the term “heir” for certain purposes
relating to civil actions; eliminating the statute of limitations for certain
civil actions arising from a death caused by homicide; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, for the purposes of allowing an heir to maintain an action for damages for a
2 death caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another person, defines the term “heir” to mean
3 a person who would be entitled to succeed to the separate property of a decedent if the
4 decedent had died intestate. (NRS 41.085) Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “heir”
5 to mean a person who, at the time such an action for damages is brought, would be entitled to
6 succeed to the separate property of the decedent.
7 Existing law generally requires a civil action to recover damages for injuries to or the
8 death of a person arising from the wrongful act or neglect of another person to be commenced
9 not later than 2 years after the date on which the wrongful act or neglect occurred. (NRS
10 11.190) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a civil action to recover damages for the death
11 of a decedent to be brought by the heirs and the personal representatives of the decedent at
12 any time upon a showing by a preponderance of evidence that the death of the decedent was a
13 homicide committed by a wrongdoer. Section 3 of this bill provides that the amendatory
14 provisions of this bill apply retroactively to any [cause of action to recover damages for]
15 wrongful act or neglect of another causing a death [caused by] that was a homicide [that
16 accrues before, on or after the effective date of this bill.] , even if the statute of limitations
17 that was in effect at the time of the act has expired, which means that a civil action that
18 would otherwise be time-barred by the former statute of limitations is revived by this
19 bill.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.085 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 41.085 1. As used in this section, “heir” means a person who, under the
3 laws of this State, at the time an action is brought pursuant to subsection 2, would
4 be entitled to succeed to the separate property of the decedent if the decedent had
5 died intestate. The term does not include a person who is deemed to be a killer of
Assembly Amendment No. 406 to Assembly Bill No. 489 Page 4
1 the decedent pursuant to chapter 41B of NRS, and such a person shall be deemed to
2 have predeceased the decedent as set forth in NRS 41B.330.
3 2. When the death of any person, whether or not a minor, is caused by the
4 wrongful act or neglect of another, the heirs of the decedent and the personal
5 representatives of the decedent may each maintain an action for damages against
6 the person who caused the death, or if the wrongdoer is dead, against the
7 wrongdoer’s personal representatives, whether the wrongdoer died before or after
8 the death of the person injured by the wrongdoer. If any other person is responsible
9 for the wrongful act or neglect, or if the wrongdoer is employed by another person
10 who is responsible for the wrongdoer’s conduct, the action may be maintained
11 against that other person, or if the other person is dead, against the other person’s
12 personal representatives.
13 3. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent and the personal
14 representatives of a decedent pursuant to subsection 2 may be commenced at any
15 time upon a showing by a preponderance of evidence that the death of the
16 decedent was a homicide committed by the wrongdoer.
17 4. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent pursuant to subsection 2 and
18 the cause of action of that decedent brought or maintained by the decedent’s
19 personal representatives which arose out of the same wrongful act or neglect may
20 be joined.
21 [4.] 5. The heirs may prove their respective damages in the action brought
22 pursuant to subsection 2 and the court or jury may award each person pecuniary
23 damages for the person’s grief or sorrow, loss of probable support, companionship,
24 society, comfort and consortium, and damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement
25 of the decedent. The proceeds of any judgment for damages awarded under this
26 subsection are not liable for any debt of the decedent.
27 [5.] 6. The damages recoverable by the personal representatives of a decedent
28 on behalf of the decedent’s estate include:
29 (a) Any special damages, such as medical expenses, which the decedent
30 incurred or sustained before the decedent’s death, and funeral expenses; and
31 (b) Any penalties, including, but not limited to, exemplary or punitive
32 damages, that the decedent would have recovered if the decedent had lived,
33  but do not include damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement of the decedent.
34 The proceeds of any judgment for damages awarded under this subsection are liable
35 for the debts of the decedent unless exempted by law.
36 Sec. 2. NRS 11.190 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 11.190 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.4639, 125B.050 and
38 217.007, actions other than those for the recovery of real property, unless further
39 limited by specific statute, may only be commenced as follows:
40 1. Within 6 years:
41 (a) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 62B.420 and 176.275, an action upon
42 a judgment or decree of any court of the United States, or of any state or territory
43 within the United States, or the renewal thereof.
44 (b) An action upon a contract, obligation or liability founded upon an
45 instrument in writing, except those mentioned in the preceding sections of this
46 chapter.
47 2. Within 4 years:
48 (a) An action on an open account for goods, wares and merchandise sold and
49 delivered.

Assembly Amendment No. 406 to Assembly Bill No. 489 Page 5
1 (d) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 11.245, an action against a person
2 alleged to have committed a deceptive trade practice in violation of NRS 598.0903
3 to 598.0999, inclusive, but the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when the
4 aggrieved party discovers, or by the exercise of due diligence should have
5 discovered, the facts constituting the deceptive trade practice.
6 3. Within 3 years:
7 (a) An action upon a liability created by statute, other than a penalty or
8 forfeiture.
9 (b) An action for waste or trespass of real property, but when the waste or

13 (c) An action for taking, detaining or injuring personal property, including
14 actions for specific recovery thereof, but in all cases where the subject of the action
15 is a domestic animal usually included in the term “livestock,” which has a recorded
16 mark or brand upon it at the time of its loss, and which strays or is stolen from the
17 true owner without the owner’s fault, the statute does not begin to run against an
18 action for the recovery of the animal until the owner has actual knowledge of such
19 facts as would put a reasonable person upon inquiry as to the possession thereof by
20 the defendant.
21 (d) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 112.230 and 166.170, an action for
22 relief on the ground of fraud or mistake, but the cause of action in such a case shall
23 be deemed to accrue upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts
24 constituting the fraud or mistake.
25 (e) An action pursuant to NRS 40.750 for damages sustained by a financial
26 institution or other lender because of its reliance on certain fraudulent conduct of a
27 borrower, but the cause of action in such a case shall be deemed to accrue upon the
28 discovery by the financial institution or other lender of the facts constituting the
29 concealment or false statement.
30 (f) An action pursuant to NRS 41.1335, but the cause of action shall be deemed
31 to accrue upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting fertility
32 fraud or of any medical or genetic disorder which results from the human
33 reproductive material implanted in, used on or provided to a patient in violation of
34 NRS 200.975, whichever occurs later.
35 4. Within 2 years:
36 (a) An action against a sheriff, coroner or constable upon liability incurred by
37 acting in his or her official capacity and in virtue of his or her office, or by the
38 omission of an official duty, including the nonpayment of money collected upon an
39 execution.

43 (c) An action for libel, slander, assault, battery, false imprisonment or
44 seduction.
45 (d) An action against a sheriff or other officer for the escape of a prisoner
46 arrested or imprisoned on civil process.

48 action to recover damages for injuries to a person or for the death of a person
49 caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another. The provisions of this paragraph
50 relating to an action to recover damages for injuries to a person apply only to

14 that was in effect at the time the wrongful act or neglect of another causing a
15 death that was a homicide occurred, including, without limitation, any civil
