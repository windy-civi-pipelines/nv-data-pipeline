SECOND REPRINT A.B. 489
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 489–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to civil actions.
(BDR 3-1141)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising the term “heir” for certain
purposes relating to civil actions; eliminating the statute
of limitations for certain civil actions against a natural
person who is deemed to be a killer or the personal
representative of the estate of such a killer; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, for the purposes of allowing an heir to maintain an action for
2 damages for a death caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another person,
3 defines the term “heir” to mean a person who would be entitled to succeed to the
4 separate property of a decedent if the decedent had died intestate. (NRS 41.085)
5 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “heir” to mean a person who, at the
6 time such an action for damages is brought, would be entitled to succeed to the
7 separate property of the decedent.
8 Existing law generally requires a civil action to recover damages for injuries to
9 or the death of a person arising from the wrongful act or neglect of another person
10 to be commenced not later than 2 years after the date on which the wrongful act or
11 neglect occurred. (NRS 11.190) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a civil action
12 to recover damages for the death of a decedent to be brought by the heirs and the
13 personal representatives of the decedent at any time against a natural person who is
14 deemed to be a killer of the decedent or the personal representative of the estate of
15 such a killer. Section 3 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of this
16 bill apply retroactively to such a civil action, even if the statute of limitations that
17 was in effect at the time of the act has expired, which means that a civil action that
18 would otherwise be time-barred by the former statute of limitations is revived by
19 this bill.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.085 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 41.085 1. As used in this section, “heir” means a person who,
3 under the laws of this State, at the time an action is brought
4 pursuant to subsection 2, would be entitled to succeed to the
5 separate property of the decedent if the decedent had died intestate.
6 The term does not include a person who is deemed to be a killer of
7 the decedent pursuant to chapter 41B of NRS, and such a person
8 shall be deemed to have predeceased the decedent as set forth in
9 NRS 41B.330.
10 2. When the death of any person, whether or not a minor, is
11 caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, the heirs of the
12 decedent and the personal representatives of the decedent may each
13 maintain an action for damages against the person who caused the
14 death, or if the wrongdoer is dead, against the wrongdoer’s personal
15 representatives, whether the wrongdoer died before or after the
16 death of the person injured by the wrongdoer. If any other person is
17 responsible for the wrongful act or neglect, or if the wrongdoer is
18 employed by another person who is responsible for the wrongdoer’s
19 conduct, the action may be maintained against that other person, or
20 if the other person is dead, against the other person’s personal
21 representatives.
22 3. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent and the
23 personal representatives of a decedent pursuant to subsection 2
24 may be commenced at any time against a natural person who is
25 deemed to be a killer of the decedent pursuant to NRS 41B.250 or
26 41B.260 or the personal representative of the estate of such a
27 killer. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS 41B.260 to the
28 contrary, for the purposes of this subsection, a determination of
29 whether a culpable actor is the killer of the decedent may be made
30 at any time by a court or jury. It is the intention of the Legislature
31 to limit the application of this subsection to natural persons who
32 are deemed to be killers. Nothing in this subsection shall be
33 construed to apply to an action premised on any form of vicarious
34 liability.
35 4. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent pursuant to
36 subsection 2 and the cause of action of that decedent brought or
37 maintained by the decedent’s personal representatives which arose
38 out of the same wrongful act or neglect may be joined.
39 [4.] 5. The heirs may prove their respective damages in the
40 action brought pursuant to subsection 2 and the court or jury may
41 award each person pecuniary damages for the person’s grief or
42 sorrow, loss of probable support, companionship, society, comfort

1 and consortium, and damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement of
2 the decedent. The proceeds of any judgment for damages awarded
3 under this subsection are not liable for any debt of the decedent.
4 [5.] 6. The damages recoverable by the personal
5 representatives of a decedent on behalf of the decedent’s estate
6 include:
7 (a) Any special damages, such as medical expenses, which the
8 decedent incurred or sustained before the decedent’s death, and
9 funeral expenses; and
10 (b) Any penalties, including, but not limited to, exemplary or
11 punitive damages, that the decedent would have recovered if the
12 decedent had lived,
13  but do not include damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement
14 of the decedent. The proceeds of any judgment for damages
15 awarded under this subsection are liable for the debts of the
16 decedent unless exempted by law.
17 Sec. 2. NRS 11.190 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 11.190 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.4639,
19 125B.050 and 217.007, actions other than those for the recovery of
20 real property, unless further limited by specific statute, may only be
21 commenced as follows:
22 1. Within 6 years:
23 (a) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 62B.420 and 176.275,

26 renewal thereof.
27 (b) An action upon a contract, obligation or liability founded

37 against a person alleged to have committed a deceptive trade
38 practice in violation of NRS 598.0903 to 598.0999, inclusive, but
39 the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when the aggrieved
40 party discovers, or by the exercise of due diligence should have
41 discovered, the facts constituting the deceptive trade practice.
42 3. Within 3 years:
43 (a) An action upon a liability created by statute, other than a

10 at the time of its loss, and which strays or is stolen from the true
11 owner without the owner’s fault, the statute does not begin to run
12 against an action for the recovery of the animal until the owner has
13 actual knowledge of such facts as would put a reasonable person
14 upon inquiry as to the possession thereof by the defendant.
15 (d) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 112.230 and 166.170,
16 an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake, but the cause

21 a financial institution or other lender because of its reliance on
22 certain fraudulent conduct of a borrower, but the cause of action in
23 such a case shall be deemed to accrue upon the discovery by the
24 financial institution or other lender of the facts constituting the
25 concealment or false statement.
26 (f) An action pursuant to NRS 41.1335, but the cause of action
27 shall be deemed to accrue upon the discovery by the aggrieved party
28 of the facts constituting fertility fraud or of any medical or genetic
29 disorder which results from the human reproductive material
30 implanted in, used on or provided to a patient in violation of NRS
31 200.975, whichever occurs later.
32 4. Within 2 years:
33 (a) An action against a sheriff, coroner or constable upon
34 liability incurred by acting in his or her official capacity and in
35 virtue of his or her office, or by the omission of an official duty,
36 including the nonpayment of money collected upon an execution.
37 (b) An action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture, where the
38 action is given to a person or the State, or both, except when the
39 statute imposing it prescribes a different limitation.
40 (c) An action for libel, slander, assault, battery, false
41 imprisonment or seduction.

11 seized, or for damages for the seizure, detention or sale of, or injury
12 to, goods, wares, merchandise or other personal property seized, or
13 for damages done to any person or property in making the seizure.

15 paid to the officer under protest, or seized by the officer in his or her
