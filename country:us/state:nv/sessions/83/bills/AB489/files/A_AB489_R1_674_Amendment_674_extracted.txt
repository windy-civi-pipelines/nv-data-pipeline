SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to civil actions. (BDR 3-1141)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising the term “heir” for certain purposes
relating to civil actions; eliminating the statute of limitations for certain
civil actions [arising from a death caused by homicide;] against a
natural person who is deemed to be a killer or the personal
representative of the estate of such a killer; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, for the purposes of allowing an heir to maintain an action for damages for a
2 death caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another person, defines the term “heir” to mean
3 a person who would be entitled to succeed to the separate property of a decedent if the
4 decedent had died intestate. (NRS 41.085) Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “heir”
5 to mean a person who, at the time such an action for damages is brought, would be entitled to
6 succeed to the separate property of the decedent.
7 Existing law generally requires a civil action to recover damages for injuries to or the
8 death of a person arising from the wrongful act or neglect of another person to be commenced
9 not later than 2 years after the date on which the wrongful act or neglect occurred. (NRS
10 11.190) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize a civil action to recover damages for the death
11 of a decedent to be brought by the heirs and the personal representatives of the decedent at
12 any time [upon a showing by a preponderance of evidence that the death of] against a natural
13 person who is deemed to be a killer of the decedent [was a homicide committed by a
14 wrongdoer.] or the personal representative of the estate of such a killer. Section 3 of this
15 bill provides that the amendatory provisions of this bill apply retroactively to [any wrongful
16 act or neglect of another causing a death that was a homicide,] such a civil action, even if the
17 statute of limitations that was in effect at the time of the act has expired, which means that a
18 civil action that would otherwise be time-barred by the former statute of limitations is revived
19 by this bill.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.085 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 41.085 1. As used in this section, “heir” means a person who, under the
3 laws of this State, at the time an action is brought pursuant to subsection 2, would
4 be entitled to succeed to the separate property of the decedent if the decedent had
5 died intestate. The term does not include a person who is deemed to be a killer of
6 the decedent pursuant to chapter 41B of NRS, and such a person shall be deemed to
7 have predeceased the decedent as set forth in NRS 41B.330.
8 2. When the death of any person, whether or not a minor, is caused by the
9 wrongful act or neglect of another, the heirs of the decedent and the personal
10 representatives of the decedent may each maintain an action for damages against
11 the person who caused the death, or if the wrongdoer is dead, against the
12 wrongdoer’s personal representatives, whether the wrongdoer died before or after
13 the death of the person injured by the wrongdoer. If any other person is responsible
14 for the wrongful act or neglect, or if the wrongdoer is employed by another person
15 who is responsible for the wrongdoer’s conduct, the action may be maintained
16 against that other person, or if the other person is dead, against the other person’s
17 personal representatives.
18 3. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent and the personal
19 representatives of a decedent pursuant to subsection 2 may be commenced at any
20 time [upon a showing by a preponderance of evidence that the death of the
21 decedent was a homicide committed by the wrongdoer.] against a natural person
22 who is deemed to be a killer of the decedent pursuant to NRS 41B.250 or 41B.260
23 or the personal representative of the estate of such a killer. Notwithstanding the
24 provisions of NRS 41B.260 to the contrary, for the purposes of this subsection, a
25 determination of whether a culpable actor is the killer of the decedent may be
26 made at any time by a court or jury. It is the intention of the Legislature to limit
27 the application of this subsection to natural persons who are deemed to be killers.
28 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to apply to an action premised on
29 any form of vicarious liability.
30 4. An action brought by the heirs of a decedent pursuant to subsection 2 and
31 the cause of action of that decedent brought or maintained by the decedent’s
32 personal representatives which arose out of the same wrongful act or neglect may
33 be joined.
34 [4.] 5. The heirs may prove their respective damages in the action brought
35 pursuant to subsection 2 and the court or jury may award each person pecuniary
36 damages for the person’s grief or sorrow, loss of probable support, companionship,
37 society, comfort and consortium, and damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement
38 of the decedent. The proceeds of any judgment for damages awarded under this
39 subsection are not liable for any debt of the decedent.
40 [5.] 6. The damages recoverable by the personal representatives of a decedent
41 on behalf of the decedent’s estate include:
42 (a) Any special damages, such as medical expenses, which the decedent
43 incurred or sustained before the decedent’s death, and funeral expenses; and
44 (b) Any penalties, including, but not limited to, exemplary or punitive
45 damages, that the decedent would have recovered if the decedent had lived,
46  but do not include damages for pain, suffering or disfigurement of the decedent.
47 The proceeds of any judgment for damages awarded under this subsection are liable
48 for the debts of the decedent unless exempted by law.
Senate Amendment No. 674 to Assembly Bill No. 489 First Reprint Page 5

19 alleged to have committed a deceptive trade practice in violation of NRS 598.0903
20 to 598.0999, inclusive, but the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when the
21 aggrieved party discovers, or by the exercise of due diligence should have
22 discovered, the facts constituting the deceptive trade practice.
23 3. Within 3 years:
24 (a) An action upon a liability created by statute, other than a penalty or
25 forfeiture.
26 (b) An action for waste or trespass of real property, but when the waste or

30 (c) An action for taking, detaining or injuring personal property, including
31 actions for specific recovery thereof, but in all cases where the subject of the action
32 is a domestic animal usually included in the term “livestock,” which has a recorded
33 mark or brand upon it at the time of its loss, and which strays or is stolen from the
34 true owner without the owner’s fault, the statute does not begin to run against an
35 action for the recovery of the animal until the owner has actual knowledge of such
36 facts as would put a reasonable person upon inquiry as to the possession thereof by
37 the defendant.
38 (d) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 112.230 and 166.170, an action for
39 relief on the ground of fraud or mistake, but the cause of action in such a case shall
40 be deemed to accrue upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts
41 constituting the fraud or mistake.
42 (e) An action pursuant to NRS 40.750 for damages sustained by a financial
43 institution or other lender because of its reliance on certain fraudulent conduct of a

45 discovery by the financial institution or other lender of the facts constituting the
46 concealment or false statement.
47 (f) An action pursuant to NRS 41.1335, but the cause of action shall be deemed
48 to accrue upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting fertility
49 fraud or of any medical or genetic disorder which results from the human
50 reproductive material implanted in, used on or provided to a patient in violation of
51 NRS 200.975, whichever occurs later.
52 4. Within 2 years:
