AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
Revenue to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim on the
advisability and feasibility of treating certain business entities [to be
treated] as a [combined taxpayer group] single entity for the purposes
of the commerce tax; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity engaged in
2 business in this State whose Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000 at a
3 rate that is based on the industry in which the business entity is primarily engaged. (NRS
4 363C.200) [Section 3 of this bill requires that certain business entities that are primarily
5 engaged in the business of renting real property located in this State to other persons be
6 treated as a single business entity for the purposes of the commerce tax. Section 2 of this bill
7 refers to such a group as a “combined taxpayer group,” and section 4 of this bill applies that
8 definition to the provisions of law governing the commerce tax. Under sections 3 and 5 of this
9 bill, for a combined taxpayer group, the applicability of the commerce tax, and the amount of
10 the commerce tax owed, would be determined based on the combined Nevada gross revenue
11 of each business entity that is treated as a member of the combined taxpayer group. Sections 6
12 and 7 of this bill make the provisions of this bill applicable only to a taxable year that begins
13 on or after July 1, 2025.] Existing law creates the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
14 Revenue and authorizes a Joint Interim Standing Committee, including the Joint
15 Interim Standing Committee on Revenue, to conduct studies directed by the Legislature
16 or the Legislative Commission, within the limits of the Committee’s budget. (NRS
17 218E.320, 218E.330) This bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
18 Revenue to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning the advisability
19 and feasibility of treating as a single entity for the purposes of the commerce tax certain
20 business entities that are primarily engaged in the business of renting real property
21 located in this State to another person. This bill requires the Committee to submit a
22 report of the results of the study and any recommendations for legislation to the Director
23 of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the 84th Session of the Nevada
24 Legislature.
