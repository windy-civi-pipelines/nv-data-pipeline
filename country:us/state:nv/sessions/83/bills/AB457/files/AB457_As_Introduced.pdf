EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring certain business entities to
be treated as a combined taxpayer group for the purposes
of the commerce tax; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity engaged
2 in business in this State whose Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds
3 $4,000,000 at a rate that is based on the industry in which the business entity is
4 primarily engaged. (NRS 363C.200) Section 3 of this bill requires that certain
5 business entities that are primarily engaged in the business of renting real property
6 located in this State to other persons be treated as a single business entity for the
7 purposes of the commerce tax. Section 2 of this bill refers to such a group as a
8 “combined taxpayer group,” and section 4 of this bill applies that definition to the
9 provisions of law governing the commerce tax. Under sections 3 and 5 of this bill,
10 for a combined taxpayer group, the applicability of the commerce tax, and the
11 amount of the commerce tax owed, would be determined based on the combined
12 Nevada gross revenue of each business entity that is treated as a member of the
13 combined taxpayer group. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make the provisions of this
14 bill applicable only to a taxable year that begins on or after July 1, 2025.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 363C of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. “Combined taxpayer group” means a group of
4 business entities required by section 3 of this act to be treated as a
5 single business entity for the purposes of the commerce tax.
