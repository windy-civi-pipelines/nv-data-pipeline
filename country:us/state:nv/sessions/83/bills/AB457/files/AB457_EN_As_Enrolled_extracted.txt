Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Revenue to conduct a study during the 2025-
2026 interim on the advisability and feasibility of treating
certain business entities as a single entity for the purposes of
the commerce tax and imposing a tax on the sale or transfer
of a controlling interest in an entity which possesses an
interest in real property in this State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity engaged
in business in this State whose Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds
$4,000,000 at a rate that is based on the industry in which the business entity is
primarily engaged. (NRS 363C.200) Existing law creates the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Revenue and authorizes a Joint Interim Standing Committee,
including the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Revenue, to conduct studies
directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission, within the limits of the
Committee’s budget. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330) This bill requires the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on Revenue to conduct a study during the 2025-2026
interim concerning the advisability and feasibility of: (1) treating as a single entity
for the purposes of the commerce tax certain business entities that are primarily
engaged in the business of renting real property located in this State to another
person, which must include, without limitation, the estimated impact to state
revenue of such treatment; and (2) imposing a tax on the sale or transfer of a
controlling interest in an entity which possesses an interest in real property in this
State, which must include, without limitation, the estimated impact of such a tax on
state and local revenue. This bill also requires the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Revenue to study the manner in which a tax on the sale or transfer of
a controlling interest in an entity which possesses an interest in real property in this
State should be administered. This bill requires the Committee to submit a report of
the results of the study and any recommendations for legislation to the Director of
the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the 84th Session of the Nevada
Legislature.

manner in which a change in the controlling interest in an entity

2. On or before January 1, 2027, the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Revenue shall submit a report of the results of the
study, including, without limitation, any recommendations for
