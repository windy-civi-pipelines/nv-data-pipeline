3 rate that is based on the industry in which the business entity is primarily engaged. (NRS
4 363C.200) Existing law creates the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Revenue and
5 authorizes a Joint Interim Standing Committee, including the Joint Interim Standing
6 Committee on Revenue, to conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative
7 Commission, within the limits of the Committee’s budget. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330) This
8 bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Revenue to conduct a study during the
9 2025-2026 interim concerning the advisability and feasibility of : (1) treating as a single entity
10 for the purposes of the commerce tax certain business entities that are primarily engaged in
11 the business of renting real property located in this State to another person [.] , which must
12 include, without limitation, the estimated impact to state revenue of such treatment; and
13 (2) imposing a tax on the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity which
14 possesses an interest in real property in this State, which must include, without
15 limitation, the estimated impact of such a tax on state and local revenue. This bill also

17 which a tax on the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity which possesses
18 an interest in real property in this State should be administered. This bill requires the

20 legislation to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the 84th
