AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Revenue to conduct a study during the
2025-2026 interim on the advisability and feasibility of
treating certain business entities as a single entity for the
purposes of the commerce tax and imposing a tax on the
sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity which
possesses an interest in real property in this State; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity engaged
2 in business in this State whose Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds
3 $4,000,000 at a rate that is based on the industry in which the business entity is
4 primarily engaged. (NRS 363C.200) Existing law creates the Joint Interim Standing
5 Committee on Revenue and authorizes a Joint Interim Standing Committee,
6 including the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Revenue, to conduct studies
7 directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission, within the limits of the
8 Committee’s budget. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330) This bill requires the Joint
9 Interim Standing Committee on Revenue to conduct a study during the 2025-2026
10 interim concerning the advisability and feasibility of: (1) treating as a single entity
11 for the purposes of the commerce tax certain business entities that are primarily
12 engaged in the business of renting real property located in this State to another
13 person, which must include, without limitation, the estimated impact to state
14 revenue of such treatment; and (2) imposing a tax on the sale or transfer of a
15 controlling interest in an entity which possesses an interest in real property in this
16 State, which must include, without limitation, the estimated impact of such a tax on
17 state and local revenue. This bill also requires the Joint Interim Standing
18 Committee on Revenue to study the manner in which a tax on the sale or transfer of

22 the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the 84th Session of the Nevada
23 Legislature.

12 (1) A business entity primarily engaged in the business of
13 renting real property located in this State to other persons, which has

22 persons which the Committee determines is advisable to study.
23 (b) The advisability and feasibility of, and estimated impact to
24 state and local revenue that would result from, imposing a tax on the
25 sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity which owns an
26 interest in real property in this State and the manner in which such a
27 tax should be administered, including, without limitation, the
28 manner in which a change in the controlling interest in an entity
29 which possesses an interest in real property should be reported and
30 the tax remitted.
31 2. On or before January 1, 2027, the Joint Interim Standing
32 Committee on Revenue shall submit a report of the results of the
33 study, including, without limitation, any recommendations for
34 legislation, to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
