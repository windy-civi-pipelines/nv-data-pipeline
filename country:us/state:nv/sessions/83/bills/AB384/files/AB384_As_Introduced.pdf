AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; requiring a juvenile facility to
create and maintain, for certain purposes, certain records
relating to certain acts of violence committed by a child in
the facility; revising provisions relating to the admission
or placement of certain children in certain facilities under
certain circumstances; requiring the Chief of the Youth
Parole Bureau of the Division of Child and Family
Services of the Department of Health and Human
Services to perform certain duties relating to children who

matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to: (1) commit a child who is
2 adjudicated delinquent to the custody of a regional facility for the treatment and
3 rehabilitation of children or state facility for the detention of children; or (2) order a
4 child to be placed in a facility for the detention of children for a violation of
5 probation. (NRS 62E.525, 62E.710) Section 3 of this bill provides that if a child is
6 adjudicated delinquent and committed by the juvenile court to a regional facility for
7 the treatment and rehabilitation of children or state facility for the detention of
8 children or ordered by the juvenile court to be placed in a facility for the detention
9 of children for a violation of probation, the facility is required to: (1) create and
10 maintain a written record documenting the commission of any act of serious
11 violence that is committed by the child against the staff of the facility or another
12 child in the facility; and (2) provide any such record to the juvenile court and all
13 other appropriate authorities to be used for certain purposes. Section 1 of this bill
14 defines the term “act of serious violence” to mean an act of violence committed by
15 a child against the staff of the facility or another child in the facility that involves:
16 (1) the use of a weapon by the child; or (2) a sustained attack or repeated attacks by
17 the child upon the staff of the facility or another child in the facility.

18 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that the definition
19 of “act of serious violence” in section 1 applies to the provisions of existing law
20 relating to juvenile justice. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to
21 clarify that the provisions of existing law relating to the disposition of a case
22 involving a child who is adjudicated delinquent apply to section 3.
23 Existing law provides that before the juvenile court commits a delinquent child
24 to the custody of a state facility for the detention of children, the juvenile court
25 must find that: (1) appropriate alternatives that could satisfactorily meet the needs
26 of the child do not exist in the community or were previously used to attempt to
27 meet such needs and proved unsuccessful; and (2) the child poses a public safety
28 risk based on the child’s risk of reoffending, as determined by a risk assessment,
29 any history of delinquency and the seriousness of the offense committed by the
30 child. (NRS 62E.505) Section 5 of this bill requires the juvenile court also to
31 consider any act of serious violence, as defined in section 1, committed by the
32 child.
33 Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
34 Department of Health and Human Services to: (1) develop a length of stay matrix
35 and establish release criteria for a state facility for the detention of children that are
36 based on a child’s risk of reoffending, as determined by a risk assessment for the
37 child, the seriousness of the act for which the child was adjudicated delinquent and
38 the child’s progress in meeting treatment goals; and (2) use the matrix and release
39 criteria in making release and discharge decisions. (NRS 62E.525) Section 6 of this
40 bill requires the Division, in developing the length of stay matrix and establishing
41 release criteria, also to consider any act of serious violence, as defined in section 1,
42 committed by the child.
43 Existing law authorizes the Division to place a delinquent child who has been
44 committed to the custody of the Division in certain facilities or public or private
45 institutions or agencies located within or outside this State under certain
46 circumstances, depending upon the age of the child. (NRS 63.440) Section 7 of this
47 bill requires the Division, in adopting any statewide policy for the admission or
48 placement of children, to consider certain specific factors, including, without
49 limitation, whether the child: (1) has been adjudicated delinquent multiple times or
50 otherwise had multiple cases disposed of; (2) has previously been adjudicated
51 delinquent for acts that involve the use or threatened use of force or violence; (3)
52 has committed any act of serious violence, as defined in section 1; and (4) does not
53 appear to be benefiting from, or to be receptive to, the programs or treatment
54 offered to the child or has otherwise demonstrated a desire not to modify his or her
55 behavior in a positive manner.
56 Existing law requires the Chief of the Youth Parole Bureau of the Division to
57 perform certain duties, including: (1) supervising all children released on parole
58 from a facility; (2) supervising all children released by other states for juvenile
59 parole in this State pursuant to interstate compact; (3) furnishing to each child
60 paroled a written statement of the conditions of the parole and instructions
61 regarding those conditions; (4) keeping informed concerning the conduct and
62 condition of all children and employees under the supervision of the Chief; and (5)
63 coordinating the functions of the Chief with those of the superintendents of each
64 facility. (NRS 63.710) Section 8 of this bill additionally requires the Chief to: (1)
65 communicate and coordinate with local school districts and officials as necessary to
66 ensure that each child paroled, if attending school, is attending school regularly and
67 not in danger of becoming a habitual truant and is receiving any necessary and
68 appropriate counseling or guidance offered by the school district; and (2) partner
69 and coordinate with available organizations, entities and persons who offer
70 programs for reentry, mentorship and other necessary services for children who are
71 paroled.
