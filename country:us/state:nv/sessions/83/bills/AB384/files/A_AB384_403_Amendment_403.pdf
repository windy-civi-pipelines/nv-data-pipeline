Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the juvenile court to: (1) commit a child who is adjudicated
2 delinquent to the custody of a regional facility for the treatment and rehabilitation of children
3 or state facility for the detention of children; or (2) order a child to be placed in a facility for
4 the detention of children for a violation of probation. (NRS 62E.525, 62E.710) Section 3 of
5 this bill provides that if a child is adjudicated delinquent and committed by the juvenile court
6 to a regional facility for the treatment and rehabilitation of children or state facility for the
7 detention of children or ordered by the juvenile court to be placed in a facility for the
8 detention of children for a violation of probation, the facility is required to: (1) create and
9 maintain a written record documenting the commission of any act of serious violence that is
10 committed by the child against the staff of the facility or another child in the facility; and (2)
11 provide any such record to the juvenile court and all other appropriate authorities to be used
12 for certain purposes. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “act of serious violence” to mean
13 an act of violence committed by a child against the staff of the facility or another child in the
14 facility that involves: (1) the use of a weapon by the child; or (2) a sustained attack or repeated
15 attacks by the child upon the staff of the facility or another child in the facility.
16 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that the definition of “act of
17 serious violence” in section 1 applies to the provisions of existing law relating to juvenile
18 justice. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that the provisions of
19 existing law relating to the disposition of a case involving a child who is adjudicated
20 delinquent apply to section 3.

Assembly Amendment No. 403 to Assembly Bill No. 384 Page 4
21 Existing law provides that before the juvenile court commits a delinquent child to the
22 custody of a state facility for the detention of children, the juvenile court must find that: (1)
23 appropriate alternatives that could satisfactorily meet the needs of the child do not exist in the
24 community or were previously used to attempt to meet such needs and proved unsuccessful;
25 and (2) the child poses a public safety risk based on the child’s risk of reoffending, as
26 determined by a risk assessment, any history of delinquency and the seriousness of the offense
27 committed by the child. (NRS 62E.505) Section 5 of this bill requires the juvenile court also
28 to consider any act of serious violence, as defined in section 1, committed by the child.
29 Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of
30 Health and Human Services to: (1) develop a length of stay matrix and establish release
31 criteria for a state facility for the detention of children that are based on a child’s risk of
32 reoffending, as determined by a risk assessment for the child, the seriousness of the act for
33 which the child was adjudicated delinquent and the child’s progress in meeting treatment
34 goals; and (2) use the matrix and release criteria in making release and discharge decisions.
35 (NRS 62E.525) Section 6 of this bill requires the Division, in developing the length of stay
36 matrix and establishing release criteria, also to consider any act of serious violence, as defined
37 in section 1, committed by the child.
38 Existing law authorizes the Division to place a delinquent child who has been committed
39 to the custody of the Division in certain facilities or public or private institutions or agencies
40 located within or outside this State under certain circumstances, depending upon the age of the
41 child. (NRS 63.440) Section 7 of this bill requires the Division, in adopting any statewide
42 policy for the admission or placement of children, to consider certain specific factors,
43 including, without limitation, whether the child: (1) has been adjudicated delinquent multiple
44 times or otherwise had multiple cases disposed of; (2) has previously been adjudicated
45 delinquent for acts that involve the use or threatened use of force or violence; (3) has
46 committed any act of serious violence, as defined in section 1; and (4) does not appear to be
47 benefiting from, or to be receptive to, the programs or treatment offered to the child or has
48 otherwise demonstrated a desire not to modify his or her behavior in a positive manner.]
49 Existing law [requires the Chief of the Youth Parole Bureau of the Division to perform
50 certain duties, including: (1) supervising all children released on parole from a facility; (2)
51 supervising all children released by other states for juvenile parole in this State pursuant to
52 interstate compact; (3) furnishing to each child paroled a written statement of the conditions of
53 the parole and instructions regarding those conditions; (4) keeping informed concerning the
54 conduct and condition of all children and employees under the supervision of the Chief; and
55 (5) coordinating the functions of the Chief with those of the superintendents of each facility.
56 (NRS 63.710) Section 8 of this bill additionally requires the Chief to: (1) communicate and
57 coordinate with local school districts and officials as necessary to ensure that each child
58 paroled, if attending school, is attending school regularly and not in danger of becoming a
59 habitual truant and is receiving any necessary and appropriate counseling or guidance offered
60 by the school district; and (2) partner and coordinate with available organizations, entities and
61 persons who offer programs for reentry, mentorship and other necessary services for children
62 who are paroled.] establishes the Juvenile Justice Oversight Commission and requires the
63 Commission to perform certain duties, which include, for example, developing and
64 periodically updating a 5-year strategic plan that establishes policies and procedures for
65 the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
66 Services and each department of juvenile services relating to the use of evidence-based
67 practices in providing services to children subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile
68 court. (NRS 62B.600, 62B.615) Section 9 of this bill requires the Chair of the
69 Commission to: (1) solicit input regarding certain subjects relating to juvenile justice;
70 and (2) submit a report to the Legislature summarizing any actions performed during
71 the previous year and setting forth any findings and recommendations regarding such
72 subjects.
