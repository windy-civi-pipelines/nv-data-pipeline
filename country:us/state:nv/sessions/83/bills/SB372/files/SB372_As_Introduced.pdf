EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the care of children; revising provisions relating
to the circumstances under which a person is not
considered to have abused or neglected a child or to have
injured, harmed or threatened the health or welfare of a
child; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) defines the term “abuse or neglect of a child” for the purposes
2 of existing law regarding the protection of children from abuse or neglect; and (2)
3 sets forth certain circumstances in which a child is not considered to be abused or
4 neglected and the health or welfare of the child is not considered to be harmed or
5 threatened, such as when the parent of the child delivers the child to a provider of
6 emergency services in accordance with certain requirements or when the parent or
7 guardian of the child, in good faith, selects and depends upon nonmedical remedial
8 treatment for the child. (NRS 432B.020) Section 1 of this bill adds to the list of
9 such circumstances in which a child is not considered to be abused or neglected and
10 the health or welfare of the child is not considered to be harmed or threatened the
11 circumstances in which the parent or guardian of the child: (1) seeks to have the
12 child admitted into a public or private mental health facility or hospital if
13 the behavioral health needs of the child pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the
14 family; or (2) brings into the home of the child a biological, foster or adoptive child
15 whose behavioral health needs pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the family.
16 Existing law establishes procedures governing the termination of parental
17 rights. (Chapter 128 of NRS) Existing law: (1) defines the term “injury” as it relates
18 to the health and welfare of a child and the termination of parental rights; and (2)
19 sets forth certain circumstances in which the health and welfare of a child are not
20 considered to be injured, such as when the child’s parent or guardian, in the
21 practice of his or her religious beliefs, selects and depends upon nonmedical
22 remedial treatment for the child, if such treatment is recognized and permitted
23 under the laws of this State. (NRS 128.013) Section 2 of this bill adds to the list of
-
*SB372*

– 2 –
24 such circumstances in which the health and welfare of a child are not considered to
25 be injured the circumstances in which the parent or guardian of a child: (1) seeks to
26 have the child admitted into a public or private mental health facility or hospital if
27 the behavioral health needs of the child pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the
28 family; or (2) brings into the home of the child a biological, foster or adoptive child
29 whose behavioral health needs pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the family.
30 Existing law: (1) establishes criminal liability relating to abuse or neglect of a
31 child under certain circumstances by prohibiting a person who is responsible for the
32 safety or welfare of a child from permitting or allowing the child to be placed in a
33 situation where the child may suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering
34 as the result of abuse or neglect; and (2) provides that such a person does not
35 commit such abuse or neglect solely because the person delivers or allows the
36 delivery of a child to a provider of emergency services. (NRS 200.508) Section 4
37 of this bill similarly provides that a person who is responsible for the safety or
38 welfare of a child does not commit abuse or neglect of a child solely because the
39 person: (1) seeks to have the child admitted into a public or private mental health
40 facility or hospital if the behavioral health needs of the child pose a risk to the
41 safety and welfare of the family; or (2) brings into the home of the child a
42 biological, foster or adoptive child whose behavioral health needs pose a risk to the
43 safety and welfare of the family. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change
44 to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 4.
