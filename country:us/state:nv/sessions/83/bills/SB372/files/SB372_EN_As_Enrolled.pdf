Senate Bill No. 372–Senator Steinbeck
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the care of children; revising provisions relating
to the circumstances under which a person is not considered
to have abused or neglected a child or to have injured,
harmed or threatened the health or welfare of a child; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) defines the term “abuse or neglect of a child” for the purposes
of existing law regarding the protection of children from abuse or neglect; and (2)
sets forth certain circumstances in which a child is not considered to be abused or
neglected and the health or welfare of the child is not considered to be harmed or
threatened, such as when the parent of the child delivers the child to a provider of
emergency services in accordance with certain requirements or when the parent or
guardian of the child, in good faith, selects and depends upon nonmedical remedial
treatment for the child. (NRS 432B.020) Section 1 of this bill adds to the list of
such circumstances in which a child is not considered to be abused or neglected and
the health or welfare of the child is not considered to be harmed or threatened the
circumstances in which the parent or guardian of the child: (1) seeks to have the
child admitted into a public or private mental health facility or hospital if
the behavioral health needs of the child pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the
family; or (2) brings into the home of the child a biological, foster or adoptive child
whose behavioral health needs pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the family.
Existing law establishes procedures governing the termination of parental
rights. (Chapter 128 of NRS) Existing law: (1) defines the term “injury” as it relates
to the health and welfare of a child and the termination of parental rights; and (2)
sets forth certain circumstances in which the health and welfare of a child are not
considered to be injured, such as when the child’s parent or guardian, in the
practice of his or her religious beliefs, selects and depends upon nonmedical
remedial treatment for the child, if such treatment is recognized and permitted
under the laws of this State. (NRS 128.013) Section 2 of this bill adds to the list of
such circumstances in which the health and welfare of a child are not considered to
be injured the circumstances in which the parent or guardian of a child: (1) seeks to
have the child admitted into a public or private mental health facility or hospital if
the behavioral health needs of the child pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the
family; or (2) brings into the home of the child a biological, foster or adoptive child
whose behavioral health needs pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the family.
Existing law: (1) establishes criminal liability relating to abuse or neglect of a
child under certain circumstances by prohibiting a person who is responsible for the
safety or welfare of a child from permitting or allowing the child to be placed in a
situation where the child may suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering
as the result of abuse or neglect; and (2) provides that such a person does not
commit such abuse or neglect solely because the person delivers or allows the
delivery of a child to a provider of emergency services. (NRS 200.508) Section 4
of this bill similarly provides that a person who is responsible for the safety or
welfare of a child does not commit abuse or neglect of a child solely because the
person: (1) seeks to have the child admitted into a public or private mental health
facility or hospital if the behavioral health needs of the child pose a risk to the
safety and welfare of the family; or (2) brings into the home of the child a
biological, foster or adoptive child whose behavioral health needs pose a risk to the

safety and welfare of the family. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change
to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 4.

NRS 432B.140,
 of a child caused or allowed by a person responsible for the
welfare of the child under circumstances which indicate that the
child’s health or welfare is harmed or threatened with harm.
2. A child is not abused or neglected, nor is the health or
welfare of the child harmed or threatened for the sole reason that:

emergency services pursuant to NRS 432B.630, if the parent
complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of subsection 3 of
that section; [or]

pursuant to NRS 62E.280 [.] ;

admitted into a public or private mental health facility or hospital

the child a biological, foster or adoptive child whose behavioral
health needs pose a risk to the safety and welfare of the family.

section, the court must find that:
